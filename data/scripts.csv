At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Reports Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. John Kraf, Vice, you may begin your conference.
John Kraft: Thanks Jacquelyn, and good morning, everybody. Today's call like all of our events, is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text to both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning's call is Phil Heasley, our CEO and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil.
Phil Heasley: Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report our first quarter financial results. We are ahead of our expectations and a strong start to 2017. First quarter revenue of $231 million was up 10% compared to last year. We also generated $42 million in EBITDA which was a 68% increase over last year and operating free cash flow of $76 million, which was a 157% from last year. In the quarter, we signed some important contracts across a range of solutions and geographies. We signed an important contract with Jack Henry to help bring Immediate Payments for a wide range of their financial institution customers, notably customers who have connected with some Clearing House and Zelle Networks through real-time systems allowing consumers and businesses to send and receive payments and data instantly directly from their accounts to the financial institutions. We also continue to make progress with our Universal Payments and Retail Payment solution initiatives signing important renewals including two with large national switches, one in the Middle East and one in Asia. These customers plan to use our flexible Universal Payments technology to gain competitive advantage with functionalities such as Apple Pay Acceptance and ATM Surcharging. Further we are seeing that transaction capacity requirements are growing faster than customers expected in terms of both newer wallets and micro payments, as well as traditional usage. In our fast-growing e-commerce segments we continue to sign contracts with traditional merchants that increasingly appreciate our industry-leading Omni channel solutions and endpoint connectivity. We are also signing customers pursuing new used cases including end console payments in the gaming vertical. Looking ahead in our pipeline we are making progress with several customers that are interested in leveraging the power of UP in significant and transformational way. We hope to have more to say later in 2017 about this. Following the successful Investors Day in March, as well as several customer-focused events, plus key geographic regions, we remain extremely optimistic that we have positioned ACI to benefit in the coming years in the evolving electronics payments landscape. In summary, ACI is off to a good 2017. We are firmly on track to achieve our financial targets for the year and are fully committed to our longer term growth goals. With that, let me turn the call over to Scott to provide details on our first quarter and 2017 guidance. Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Thanks Phil, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of the first quarter and then provide a reminder of our outlook for the full year 2017. We'll then open the line for questions. I’ll be starting my comments on Slide 6 with key takeaways from the quarter. Now, overall, we had a solid start to 2017. Our renewal bookings were particularly strong up 34% over last year. This was offset by a decline in new bookings mainly given the timing and the particularly strong comparison in Q1 2016 when we saw nearly 50% growth. We continue to expect full year new bookings growth to be in the high-single-digits Our 12 month and 60 month backlog declined $6 million and $23 million respectively from Q4 2016, again mainly due to the timing of new bookings. We saw strong growth in revenue, up 10% over the prior year quarter and given a relatively fixed cost structure, this revenue growth delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 68% compared to the prior year quarter. We saw strong growth in operating free cash flow coming in at $76 million and more than double the prior year quarter and while we don’t officially guide the cash flow for the year, we are clearly tracking ahead of our original forecast. We ended this quarter with a $100 million in cash and a debt balance of $710 million, down $43 million during the quarter. And lastly, here we have $78 million remaining on our share buyback authorization. And one thing of note, as we mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, we have updated our financial segment disclosures in our Form 10-Q to reflect our new two P&L organizational structure and have presented our revenue and profitability for our ACI on-demand business, which consists of our Software as a Service and Platform as a Service and our ACI on-premise business which consists of our traditional license maintenance and professional services operations. So you will see that when we file our 10-Q. Turning next to Slide 7 with our full year outlook. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for the full year 2017 we expect revenue to be in a range of $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion and we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $250 million to $255 million and we expect new bookings growth to be in the high-single-digits. For Q2, we expect revenue to be in a range of $225 million to $230 million. So overall a strong start to the year and positions us well to achieve our financial targets in 2017. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open up the line for questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Eller from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David Eller: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned in the script that you’ve signed two national switches in the Middle East and Asia and I wondered if you could talk more about the pipeline for additional opportunities for that segment.
Phil Heasley: Our pipelines are very, very strong almost everyone around the world is either in planning to upgrade or in the process of upgrading as electronic payments redefine themselves with much more width of how electronic real-time payments take place, but – around the world and last place is whether it be in India, Far East, places that are just growing their consumer economies they are growing much more rapidly on the ecommerce side than they are in, the more traditional, what we view as traditional way.
David Eller: Okay, and then, you also just mentioned, I think you said that the volumes are more quickly than customers expected. Could you just provide a little bit more color there? I think you talked about micro wallets, but any other color you’ve got there?
Phil Heasley: Well, traditionally the growth in ecommerce transactions even for our traditional customers who are renewing and we’ve had tremendous successes on our RPF programs. So what’s come with that is, people not only renewing their traditional business with us were getting a very healthy growth in the incremental transactions that they are purchasing going forward. That I will remember there.
David Eller: Gotcha, is that – I guess, my question – but about a point on is, has that kind of changed early in 2017 versus what you saw last year or is that just a continuation of the trend that you are speaking to?
Phil Heasley: I think we saw it in the fourth quarter of – I think we saw it accelerate towards the end of – we saw an acceleration towards the end of last year which is continuing.
David Eller: Okay, and then, Scott, I think you mentioned on cash flow that’s tracking kind of ahead of your original thoughts and I wondered if you could provide any color on you know what additional – what you might apply that extra cash to?
Scott Behrens: I would say, generally, our – I would say we apply it for historical uses of cash. Obviously, we have scheduled term repayments. We would look at – games type acquisitions as well as we still have nearly $8 million left on our share buyback authorization. So I think the overall uses of cash will generally be along those lines.
David Eller: Okay, thanks for taking the questions.
Scott Behrens: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Sutton from Craig Hallum. Your line is open.
George Sutton: Thank you guys and I appreciate the relatively quick commentary. So, as we look at the UP platform, can you just walk through what is live? What’s in implementation? And then what are you seeing from a pipeline perspective?
Phil Heasley: What is live on the UP platform, we have – we don’t have that many customers that are totally – that are totally live on – we probably have a dozen or so RPFs that have rich customers that are live. We have some very big projects that are finishing Phase 1. On the retailer side, we have some big projects, railroads, retailers and I am not saying the third category.
Scott Behrens: Hotels.
Phil Heasley: But.
Scott Behrens: Hotels.
Phil Heasley: Hotels, right that are just coming live. You don’t see the impact of those yet and we have some – from a pipeline standpoint, we have not a few but several transformational UP deals that are in the pipeline, George. So, I had never felt – since it’s been a labor of love for over a decade, I’ve never felt more comfortable about us than I feel right now.
George Sutton: Perfect. And I know at your Analyst Day, you had a day before the financial analyst day with the industry analyst day. And my sense is coming out of that, you’ve kind of opened some of their eyes relative to the product set that you have. Can you just give us an update of what you’ve heard from the industry analysts side since that point?
Phil Heasley: Well, I think the best thing we’ve heard from them that we felt pleased and were grateful is that the immediate increase in dialogue and pipeline that came from that, I believe was our greatest affirmation and then I also believe having demonstrated real-time both the days, Financial Analysts Day. But we also did it the day before demonstrating our – the UP capabilities and that UP is not hard wired hub type structure but it’s a tightly orchestrated, very variable interactor set so to speak. That really struck us forward with several of our – of the people that follow our industry that hadn’t attained that level of comfort before. So, that was very positive for us.
George Sutton: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Wayne Johnson: Yes, good morning. In the – on the quarter report, and I apologize if you went over this, but could you just highlight any G&A call outs in the expenses? And then I have a follow-up to that.
Scott Behrens: Yes, I wouldn’t say there is anything in particular. I think most of our cost structure generally is the same any year-over-year difference could be attributable mostly to timing of certain professional fees.
Wayne Johnson: Okay. So, was there and on perhaps related, I don’t know, I’ll let you answer, but, was there any further progress or anything else to comment regarding the IT consolidation in Europe?
Phil Heasley: Yes, I mean, we are – thanks for asking that question. We are within one quarter of taking 20 some datacenters down into four datacenters and I think you know we said we’ve invested in the very recent past $100 million in capital costs and some of that cost is continuing to build highly leveragable infrastructure that today were easily balanced between our ability to support North America and our ability to support the European, Middle East African continents. So, we are within one quarter of concluding that effort.
Wayne Johnson: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you for that color. And then also on the revenue line, license revenue was certainly a little bit better than our model, a very profitable revenue stream. Do you feel or sense that there is going to be a more predictable cadence on the license side? I know, you guys have talked a lot about the services and delivering SaaS type of capabilities. But just on the license side itself, could you talk a little bit about how you see that cadence throughout this year?
Phil Heasley: Well, the license by its nature has a pretty – I mean that’s a lot of that is not recurring. So it has seasonality to it part of the beat in the first quarter was higher than expected with capacity revenues which can be – it’s really, it’s based on a numbers by the customers that need capacity in a given quarter. So, part of that beat was higher capacity which in last year sort of came later in the year.
Wayne Johnson: Okay, great. All right. Thank you
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Alex Veytsman from Monness Crespi & Hardt. Your line is open.
Alex Veytsman: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the guidance. It looks like you adjust the guidance intact, there was a good beat that you are all suspecting, I mean, the Jack Henry deal although, I mean, I think the question is whether it’s going to impact this year? Is that just you being conservative keeping the guidance intact or is there something you could be seeing for the next few quarters?
Phil Heasley: We are very – we – our business has a natural shape to it of which you have the first three quarters and then you have the fourth quarter, right. And the first three quarters can look a lot more lumpy year-to-year against each other, because they are not that specific into the fourth quarter. I suppose, we could get out over our feeds and what not to be more aggressive. We are a little more aggressive as relative to cash we are going to bring in. But other than that, this gives us the luxury of bringing on as high quality as that a deal as we can. So it certainly makes our guidance more comfortable for us. So we are not – we don’t think there is any value and increasing it at this point. Scott, do you want?
Scott Behrens: I would agree with that. I think it’s certainly de-risked to what would typically be a pretty heavy fourth quarter. So, great way to start the year and we are comfortable with where we are at.
Phil Heasley: If you look at what we are doing certainly is, we have significantly increased bookings in our business and the bookings, it takes us at the short end of the 180 days, at the long end it takes us almost 500 days to install these bookings. And so, if you ask me if I felt lot better about 2019 and second half of 2018, I do feel a lot better about it. But, we don’t felt – so we can’t convert it right away to our revenue line.
Alex Veytsman: Okay, that’s fair. That’s fair. And then, the Jack Henry deal, I mean, when should we expect going be first or the once they hit is it going to be this year or is it mainly next year?
Phil Heasley: You’ll see most of those revenues next year.
Alex Veytsman: Okay, okay. And can you share the runrate or is it something you don’t disclose?
Phil Heasley: No.
Alex Veytsman: Okay.
Phil Heasley: You know, we’ve been disclosing their proprietary information, but from now, we couldn’t do that.
Alex Veytsman: All right. And then finally, you mentioned several important contracts in the quarter that were signed anything that’s going to hit this year?
Scott Behrens: Not necessarily I think one of the bigger ones is Jack Henry. So we said that will likely begin next year. On some of the contracts that are in our SaaS and platform businesses have shorter time to install. So we could begin to see those recurring revenues kick in before we exit 2017. But not a pretty – not a significant contributor this year and lot of the sales that we get in any particular year are going to build our backlog and really contribute to future year’s revenue.
Alex Veytsman: Okay, very helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Huff from Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open.
Brett Huff: Thanks, good morning. So, Scott and John, hope you are all well. A question for you on, I just want to make sure I am – we reconcile or I reconcile my mind, the momentum we seem to be seeing specifically a big 4Q UP deal, some more important deals closed that you guys noted. Just reconcile that with the bookings number being down year-over-year and then the backlog numbers being down year-over-year. So just, we had a couple questions on that. I want to make sure that we all understood how that was working given what looks like better momentum in the numbers?
Scott Behrens: Well, I would say, again Q1 had a – I said it in my prepared comments, the comp with last year, Q1 last year if you look back was nearly 50% growth. So, we had a very strong Q1 last year and essentially maintained our full year guidance. I wouldn’t look at Q1 as anything other than a – as a tough comp. So and the backlog is also a factor of that in that in a quarter in which you have as much revenue as we did. It’s again, it’s a timing issue when we have the new bookings, because it’s the new bookings, that’s still backlogs. And so, again, I think they are both are a function of timing in the year and as we get into Q2, Q3 and Q4 and we start to see those new bookings pick up, that’s ultimately going to feed the backlog and contribute to future.
Phil Heasley: Yes, Brett, this is Phil. I just think, I don’t want to overly make it. Bookings by quarter, fourth quarter is picking up that you can really have a good year-on-year. But what will probably happen in the second quarter is, we will do tremendously versus the previous year. So, and I wouldn’t want to overly celebrate that too, right. It just has to do with the way it comes, certainly the first half of the year, the way it comes in. We are – I could not – I am more confident than I was three months ago about our ability to make our full year bookings. But, I don’t want to make too many excuses about the first quarter and I am not going to pretend second quarter that with the second coming, because we have such a great year-to-year comp. It’s kind of – it’s year-to-year, we sell capital-oriented items and what not, where there is only buys at the first quarter, they buy at the third quarter, that’s not that big, that’s not that big a deal. What we like about selling it’s earlier in the year is it gives us more discretion towards the end of the year, but we are very, very comfortable. The momentum is here. I think we told you, we are not renewing deals prematurely unless there is some customer needs for it to take place and that shows up the year-to-year a little bit. We signed very little in the way of renewal but it wasn’t a time appropriate to do. So, I am very, very – the net is, I am very comfortable where we are and we are not going to take more credit than we deserve, say, next quarter we blow that at the border, we are not going to take credit for that, because it’s the sum of the two quarters, it’s again the full year commitment.
Brett Huff: That’s helpful. And then, my follow-up is, I walked away from the Analyst Day thinking I have underappreciated the Immediate Payments opportunity. The panel was really helpful that signing of Jack Henry is a big deal. We’ve been very focused on the UP deal specifically vis-à-vis the banks kind of from their debit business and moving beyond that as you say more different electronic payments, as you guys look out and think about the addressable market, are you – do you see the Immediate Payments markets ultimately being larger, maybe than the UP market with the banks in your more traditional business? Or give us a sense of how you rank those.
Phil Heasley: Well, I think you know that UP powers everything we do. So UP powers our Immediate Payments capability. I think that, just my personal – lot of decades in the payments business, I think we are underestimating the power of Immediate Payments the same way thirty years ago we underestimated the power of credit buys. And that I think we’ll be amazed – I think real-time commerce deserves and requires real-time payments and whether the world collectively understands what they are putting together it happens then, but suddenly all the governments around the world and their central banks become en lighten that that real-time payments and I think you are going to see under an UP infrastructure that real-time had wire and Immediate Payments are going to become couple cousins and you are going to see a lot more sophisticated way that companies big and small and there is no way they are going to hold the individual out of the benefit of Immediate Payments. I think Immediate Payments is huge, first you have to build the infrastructure, then you have to build its usage. But so much of the world is coming onboard at the same time and so many of the people are thinking globally about how the scheme should work and it’s just making a lot of – I couldn’t be more enthusiastic about Immediate Payments and we are seeing that in the marketplace. I mean, the – our customer base certainly getting it. So, the ones that are seeking us out, they certainly get it. And I would say that the retailers understand and the e-commerce players understand Immediate Payments maybe – they are making more benefit to us than even the financial institutions and financial intermediaries.
Brett Huff: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: There are no other questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
John Kraft: Well, thank you all for dialing in and we look forward to catching up with everybody in the coming weeks. Have a good day.

1;ACIW;2017-07-27;"Operator: Good morning. My name is Hyde, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Reports Quarter Two Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. John Kraf, Vice President Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
John Kraft: Thanks Hyde, and good morning, everybody. Today's call like all of our events is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text to both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning's call is Phil Heasley, our CEO and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil.
Phil Heasley: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report our second quarter results. Q2 was another strong quarter for ACI and continued affirmation of our universal payment strategy. And second quarter new bookings were up 11% over last year. Second quarter revenue up $241 million was up 10% over last year, we also generated $44 million in EBITDA which was a 105% increase over last year. In the quarter in second quarter we continued to sign some important contracts across the range of solutions and geography and made substantial progress with large and transformational universal payments opportunities. In our fast-growing e-commerce platform, we continued to expand our end points and global connectivity with new partnerships including Alipay the world's largest online and mobile payment platform, we also signed a large on demand contract with another top European retailer for our UP retail payments offering. In our bill payment platform segment, we signed several contracts including a large U.S. based online loan originator for our UP payment bill payments solution. Lastly, we continue to sign new immediate payment contracts with both the Mexican and international, financial institutions. One notable contract was signed with a large financial institution in Asia for both ACI's immediate payment solution as well as our universal online banker cash management solutions, this customer will use ACIs universal payments to orchestrate their overall payments business. Looking ahead our pipeline is substantial, the number of customers is leveraging the power of UP continues to grow. In summary 2017 has been strong, we are well prepared to achieve our financial targets for the year we remain commitment to our longer-term growth goals. With that, let me turn it over to Scott who will provide you with much more detail the second quarter of 2017. Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Thanks Phil, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of the second quarter and then provide a reminder of our outlook for 2017. We'll then open the line for questions. I’ll be starting my comments on Slide 6 with key takeaways from the quarter. I still say Q2 was another strong quarter for us with new bookings up 11% over the prior year quarter, these strong bookings contributed to solid growth in our backlog with 12 months and 16 months backlog drawing 18 million and 24 million respectively during the quarter. Q2 revenue was $241 million up 10% over the prior year quarter, this strong growth combined with our relatively fixed cost structure helped us deliver very strong 105% growth in adjusted EBITDA. We ended the quarter with $95 million in cash and a debt balance of 705 [ph] million which is down from 753-million-year end and we have 78 million remaining on our share buyback authorization. Turning next to slide seven. With our full year outlook, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for the full year 2017 we continue to expect revenue to be in a range of $1 billion to $1.025 billion. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $250 million to $255 million and we expect new bookings growth to be in high single-digits. And for Q3 we expect revenue to be in a range of $210 million to $225 million. So overall, we are very pleased with the Q2 performance with strong growth in new bookings revenue and EBITDA, this follows a strong Q1 performance allowing us to reaffirm our full year guidance. So that concludes my prepared remarks, operator we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig Hallum. Please go ahead.
George Sutton: So, I wanted to understand a little bit more when Phil when you say pipeline is sustainable I wanted to look at that in the context of some of the UP success that you have had as folks have begun to go live what that is doing relative to the velocity of that pipeline?
Phil Heasley: We can discuss the pipeline for a long time because we have the retailer segment we have the bill payer segment, which we don’t talk as much about those as we do the core banking, the bank statements but they are growing very well more and more as ecommerce becomes more global and these guys have platforms that deliver real time product around the world, they are finding it more and more difficult to have 15, 18 different relationships in order to execute their payments. So, they are getting out in front of the market place and figuring out how to -- in effect build the layer on top of those 18 layers to control their destiny. And that’s going very, very well. And you couple that with -- I talked about Alipay and what not, that people in terms of wanting global reach they do it through global connectivity right now. And our PAY.ON product which is built into that UP platform as a multipurpose solution not just a connectivity solution is being very well received around the world. We are having some very good conversations. And at that point it starts melting, it starts crossing over because the financial institutions, the financial intermediaries they have the same kinds of needs as the retailers do as that point as each one is trying figure out how to globalize their solution. And quite honestly how you pay you pay ubiquitous versus access the payment ubiquitous, so they want as many different payment methods to make sense and the more and more that are real time, the more that match their business model the more they want to take in. So, we are ending up having conversations all around the world just very good and some are very large and many of them are more medium to large. And they are just progressing very well because I think everyone has consultants and as they are -- everyone's getting consulted towards solutions we are being looked on that in a rather favorable life, we are very proud of that at this point. I don’t if that answers your questions I can't get specific about customers or anything like that that would be disingenuous, but that’s the best attempt I can make to answer that question.
Unidentified Analyst: And let me also ask you in this context and this will be my follow up. So, the faster payments paper summary just came out I was just curious what do you think that does to some of the velocity of your pipeline and now that there is at least some sense of a time date set? I'm just curious your takeaways from that updated paper.
Phil Heasley: Well, we feel good about it, but we view Immediate Payments as global phenomena. It's amazing how much of the world is involved in this. We're working Immediate Payments on every continent that has payments to speak so. It's good to see the U.S. catching up because the U.S. has actually been way behind and I think for a lot of reasons. But they've been way behind in terms of this and I think that's very positive as the U.S. represents really important market both inbound and outbound as it relates to the Immediate Payment offerings.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good morning, Phil, Scott and John. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a nice quarter. Two questions for you, one I think this is for Scott, you had a nice speed on revenue and profit in 2Q but didn't raise guidance. Should we imply that you all just maybe got some revenue sooner than you expected or how should we interpret those two facts is that the right interpretation?
Scott Behrens: Well, if you look relative to last year obviously we had a disproportionate amount of our revenue set in the fourth quarter and our margin set in the fourth quarter. So, you look at it on a year-over-year basis. Yeah, we had a very strong first half, but it's essentially deep risks what we have to do to deliver on the second half of the year. So, lot of opportunities gives us options but we're comfortable with where we are at in the guidance that we have out there.
Brett Huff: Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just walk us through the -- how the existing UP deals as they have been implemented or being implemented, how is that revenue recognition starting to develop? As I understand that there is a brand-new UP deal, it takes a long time to recognize that revenue because of the brand-new implementation. But if they are using the special sort of contractual method that you guys have developed that sort of implies that they are going to move volume over time to a new switch that is UP enabled, that revenue recognition can happen sooner. Are you seeing people move those volumes if those are already sort of those contracts are enforced?
Scott Behrens: Yeah, I'll take that [indiscernible] I mean I wouldn't say there is a way that customers are adopting and implementing UP. I mean there is certainly a lot of the UP, upside is going to come from adding volumes. And so certain customers that will impact us as those volumes come and as they consume that incremental capacity. Others on the other hand can be sold and we can begin recognizing that revenue right away especially if it's on [indiscernible] if we deliver the software and they are going to install themselves and they purchase the capacity. So, I wouldn't say there is a way. A lot of the upside in the UP strategy is ultimately going to be in their increased consumption, their increased use and their higher transaction. And so, the real values when they get it installed and they begin to put the weather its consolidating volumes on to their switching or they put alternative payment type volumes through UP. That's really where the power of it comes to us, once installed it's really the incremental volume growth.
Phil Heasley: So, let me add a little tiny bit on to that. Our RPS program which is basically our renewal program where we are giving the option to the customers to pick up both classic and using UP technology bridging the new high-speed EPS switch on to it which allows them to migrate versus convert, does that when we first do these deals we are then commit for to certain incremental volume and we will see some of the value in terms of that incremental volume. What we are really doing is giving them the ability over that next five-year period to both move existing volume, from one side to the other and then we are giving them the ability to take other real-time payments and not try to force them into an old closed system that classic was and I will tell you that this year we have almost 90 some percent adoption rate of RPS versus just a pure renewal so that part is going very well. Most of the opportunity for us we had a little bit ad contract signing of over the increased level of yield over the next five years but then our big opportunity comes as they start not so much converting but putting on other it becomes very efficient for them to put other programs on and one way if I was a third-party and I will want to see how well that was doing, it will correlate directly with as Linux servers become more and more and more the main stay, there are other more expensive servers that you are going to see their volumes going down because in the old world, we were probably 20% of the total costs hardware middleware, software, other software was 80%, in the new environment its much of a software play giving them the ability to say 50%, 60% of those other three categories, so the yield is very large for our customers which I think left to that yield and then the incremental volume comes as a natural consequence of it being the payments of platform. Is that overly confusing?
Unidentified Analyst: No that make sense, thank you and then if I can speak one more in, can you just give us sort of a quick overview of what exactly you all are doing for Alipay.
Phil Heasley: We are presenting Alipay as a global end point for whoever wants to use it. I can’t say any more, right I can’t say any more than that.
Unidentified Analyst: So, we should think if it is another payment type in the payment gateway, is that fair?
Phil Heasley: Well yeah it was another, it's now globally available end point. For those people using our solutions.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great, thank you.
Phil Heasley: Very important to them, they have a 135 million people, they owe it, not a big piece of their population less than 10% or whatever, but they have a 135 million people that are travelling around the world and they need access to their payment devices their payment method.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Eller from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
David Eller: Good morning, thank you for taking my questions. You mentioned you are making progress on the bill pay segment with the large U.S. originator online loans and also if you can talk a little bit more about the bill pay business, if I recall correctly that was historically more domestic focused and maybe if you could just talk about opportunities you have there and whether there are opportunities to expand internationally?
Phil Heasley: We are in the EBPP business we are not in the classic bill pay business where you go have your monthly journal and you do your bills, that’s not our business. Our business is connecting -- again its payments its connecting people who need to satisfy a payment with the end point that they need to take place. We have actually gotten very, very good feedback and we built quite a book of business around with financials and financial intermediates that are in. The loan type businesses that really need flexibility and looking more -- they are looking more and more at the value of direct connections and whereas they are ready fairly well connected with the financial institutions in terms of the origination and maintenance of the loans satisfaction of the payment it's something that they are looking for more agility and more options and what not and that’s working out very well for us. We have put I think we have worked four years now on improving the platforms that we purchased and we have a little bit probably another year and a half or so to go before we would think about going internet. We want to really build what we have as best of class and then we will think about internationalizing it. What a lot of people think about as I think EBPP may end up being one of the main payment types. We think of bill payment as a gateway. The combination of Immediate Payments and bill pay -- bill pay may lend up actually begin the payment type that M&A stand up the growth of immediate payments.
Unidentified Analyst: And then Scott I think this one is for you, you didn’t mention the BHMI lawsuit, is that matter now settled, that last appeal, is that probably the last we should hear about that lawsuit?
Scott Behrens: Generally, yes, I mean that was taken to the state spring court and that judgment is final. And we will make that cash payment here in the third quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: And then last one for me. We haven’t really seen an announcement on that M&A front and sometime and I wondered if you could talk about if you are still actually pursuing M&A opportunities for what pipeline looks like? And maybe what part of the portfolio you could look at?
Scott Behrens: I wouldn’t necessarily say what we would be looking at but I think we are always generally looking at being opportunistic. But yes, we haven’t made an acquisition now for what's going on for almost two years. But again, we be opportunistic probably in two areas, I wouldn't say there is necessarily any holes or gaps in our capabilities but certainly areas where we could get scale if we would be able to provide scale of top of our global infrastructure, those would-be situations but not as much holes in our capabilities.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul [Condro] from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just got a couple of questions on the expenses. So, if you take the [indiscernible] amount of G&A you had a nice kind of tick down in the second quarter. So, I wonder if you can talk about relative to the $130 million in 2016 how you think that G&A trends for the rest of this year?
Scott Behrens: Well, yes and we had said this after in Q1 because we had seen G&A spike up a little bit. But, it's at the time I expected it to drop and level out through the rest of the year and that's really what we're seeing. So, I don't see anything in particular within the G&A area for the rest of the year which should again be lower and level out throughout the rest of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then also I guess on R&D I know that you have big investment here last year but R&D has come down now last couple of quarters, so should we think of that as kind of the new run rate or is there anything caused that to move up?
Scott Behrens: I wouldn't say anything in particular that would drive it to move up, yeah, we made, we have invested pretty heavily in our product capabilities over the last couple of years. But we've also we also moved resource to, both same technical resources can be used for implementation work platform build things like that. So, it's not necessarily that we have reduced our overall investment in R&D. It's that some of those same technical resources are doing everything. And nothing that would indicate that we would see some unusual spike at a later date.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then, Phil I just wanted to ask you, a bit more of a broader question just for PSP too if you could talk a little bit about the conversation you're having with your partners, I mean it sounds like there is still not a lot of clarity on what those regs [ph] are going to require banks to do and how banks are going to do it. And so, one just kind of what are you hearing? And two, are there any risks to the whole timeline that's kind of been laid out? Thanks.
Phil Heasley: I don't want to sit here and say there is going to be a risk to the timeline because then I am kind of commenting about other people's [indiscernible]. I think it's like any change I think there is confusion and there is certain level of questioning right, which can be interpreted. I don't understand or it's hard to understand can mean several things if you're trying to participate in a mandate or you're trying to manage its outcome. We're comfortable, we're not uncomfortable with the dates, I guess put it that way and we're seeing this around the rest of the -- we're seeing this as initiating issue around the rest of the world. Actually, something is making us feel very good about our business. Our NFRs, our nonfunctional requirements are always being about scalability, availability and throughput, we don't build things first small or medium volumes. We build things for high volumes. And so, we see a lot of these mandates going through the rest of the world now and immediate payments and other things, we're finding that scaling is becoming difficult in a lot of these implementations and that very nicely plays into our space because we're up into solution in terms of scaling it up. But, I don't want to really enter the fray in terms of the realism and the timeline so not hope you can appreciate that.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thanks. Yeah, I understood guys. thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Wayne Johnson: Hi, yes good morning. So, we have had a lot of discussion on this call and prior calls on the demand for the UP solution and the core payment engine that goes with it and there is no -- there doesn’t seem to be any question that there is a long runway of opportunity for ACI in that regard. So, my question is really on the competitive side, have you seen or are hearing about development of any competing products that could provide a similar solution in either at the banks, the transaction processors or the retailers that you guys serve?
Phil Heasley: Well, Wayne, that will depend what we were -- on the front side we have lots competitors, I don’t think that market place has settled itself down to -- we maybe in the top three or four but there is properly 15 or 18 viable players in terms of that. On the bill pay side, we certainly have formidable competitors and we are kind of niche on the EBPP side but we obviously plenty of competition, we see plenty of competition there. On the retail side, on the retailer side, I think the transformation that’s going to take place there is going either people’s businesses are going to become obsolete or they are going to have figure out how to try to work their way towards being more competitive with what leads you. So, I expect some level of competition there, but in terms of our core capabilities, I still think our biggest competitor would be someone deciding for whatever reason they want to build that capability themselves and they are willing to put the 3 to 5 or 4 to 6 years into whatever it would take for themselves and I think has to be some overarching strategic reason why that makes sense from the plumbing of the industry but that’s the best answer I can give you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue.
John Kraft: Well thanks everybody, we look forward to chatting in the coming weeks.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. It is my pleasure to turn the conference call over to John Kraft, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Kraft: Thanks Raquel and good morning everybody. Today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of the presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning's call is Phil Heasley, our CEO and Scott Behrens, our CFO. But before we start, I just want to make sure everybody is aware that we will be attending Citi's Financial Technology Conference on November 7th and that ACI will be hosting an Analyst Day here in Naples on November 14th. Later in November, we'll be attending the Bank of America Leverage Finance Conference as well as the Credit Suisse 21st Annual TMT Conference. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil.
Philip G. Heasley: Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Quarter three was another strong quarter for ACI in continuation of a solid 2017. We came in ahead of our revenue and EBITDA guidance and made significant progress in the execution of several strategic initiatives. Our sales pipeline remained strong and growing across all our solutions, and we are confident in achieving our full year financial targets. Let me discuss some of the trends in the market and strategic deals signed in the quarter. We continue to have success with our Up Retail Payment Solution program, including the renewal of a large customer in Australia this quarter. 2017 is the second year we have offered RPS, and we continue to see virtually all of our BASE24 customers opting for this package, which bridges them to our powerful UP technology. The results of the RPS programs are exceeding our expectations, and we are realizing 25% to 30% uplift in contract values over the terms of the agreement. In Asia, we have been awarded a contract to build out a national switch, which will leverage our UP immediate payments as the infrastructure for its real-time payments platform. All of the approximately 40 member banks will require technology to connect to this switch. With many of these member banks already ACI customers, we have multiple opportunities for additional immediate payment gateway deals. We are seeing significant interest in our UP immediate payments offering and expect to sign several more contracts in the coming quarter. We also continued to sign large EBPP contracts, including one of the largest contracts ever in the healthcare space. This customer will use ACI's Up build payment solution to offer their clients an omnichannel solution with an easy-to-use single e-wallet experience. Healthcare is a growing market for our biller solution. Overall, there's been a lot of activity in the payment space. In conjunction with numerous industry events, including Sibos and Money20/20, we have announced material upgrades to several ACI solutions, including UP payment risk management, our fraud and analysis solution, UP real-time payments which combines our UP immediate payments in MTS solutions, into a single offering for both high and low value real time payments as well as our award-winning digital banking solution, Universal Online Banker. With three major product releases 2017 is not a normal year. In addition, we also unveiled a new API manager capability across all our UP solutions to support financial institutions open-banking strategies. These upgrades are the combination of significant investments we have made over the last several years, and we are confident they will create increased shareholder value in the years to come. You will hear more details at our Analyst Day on November 14th. This event will be in Naples for both industry and financial analysts. In summary, 2017 is proving to be an important year. We have largely digested recent acquisitions, winding down our data center and cyber security investments and taken the actions to support ongoing growth. We are well prepared to achieve our financial targets for the year and remain committed to our longer-term growth goals. With that, let me turn it over to Scott, who'll provide more detail on our third quarter and full year outlook. Thank you.
Scott W. Behrens: Thanks, Phil and good morning everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of the third quarter and then provide an update on our outlook for 2017. We'll then open the line for questions. I'll be starting my comments on slide 6, with key takeaways from the quarter. As Phil said, Q3 was another solid quarter for us. We saw revenue of $226 million, up 3% over the prior year quarter and ahead of the guidance we provided you last quarter. This revenue growth contributed a strong EBITDA growth, which was up 34% from last year and an EBITDA margin of 25%, which was 600 basis points higher than last year. New bookings were $143 million, which was down from Q3 last year in our 12 month and 60 month backlogs of $883 million and $4.1 billion, were also down a bit during the quarter, although it's not uncommon for us to see small decreases before we enter the fourth quarter, which historically represents our biggest bookings quarter. And we do expect to see strong sequential growth in all these categories in Q4. Year-to-date, we've generated $82 million in free cash flow, which is up 94% over the same period last year. We ended the quarter with $68 million in cash. We had a debt balance of $703 million, which is down $51 million this year. And we have $78 million remaining on our share buyback authorization. Turning next to slide 7, with our full year outlook, with 60 days left in the year, we are raising the low-end of our revenue guidance range for the year. So for the full year, we are now expecting revenues to be in a range of $1,010,000,000 to $1,025,000,000, which is up from the prior range of $1,000,000,000 to $1,025,000,000. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $250 million to $255 million, and we continue to expect new bookings growth to be in the upper single digit. So overall, Q3 results continue a solid 2017 performance, and we're comfortable raising the lower end of our revenue guidance range. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from line of Brett Huff from Stephens.
Brett Huff: Good morning. Can you guys hear me okay?
Philip G. Heasley: Yes. Good morning.
Brett Huff: Okay, great. Congrats on a nice quarter. Two questions, my first one is Phil, you mentioned this in the past but I wanted to get a little more specific if we could. You have said there is several large transformational bank UP deals still in the pipeline. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on that as they progress further in the pipeline and kind of what's -- what are the things to knock down in order to close those? That's my number one. And then my follow-up is, can you give us some insight into how the big $80 million five year deal that you closed in 4Q, I don't know how that's rolling through bookings and rolling through backlog but Scott can you give us a sense of did that show up or if it didn’t, kind of what's masking it? So those are my two questions, thanks.
Philip G. Heasley: Okay. Let me answer. I was -- I wanted to be very specific on the RPS program. So when you think about our BASE24, it was not BASE24 UP, there is some interest in terms of who is on the old technology and who is on the new technology. Last year, we introduced a program in which we said, listen, for a larger commitment going forward, we would provide the bridging mechanism between the old and the new, and let people migrate versus try to do the major conversion on legacy systems that have been in as much as decades. And last year, we were very pleased, put it in the second half of the year, and we saw a 90% plus adoption rate of the new program. We've got 60 days left in this year, and we are virtually at 100% adoption. And that includes the largest banks that -- what -- so every year, about 20% of our customers renew. Our attrition is as low or lower than it has ever been, which is almost not measurable. And these contracts are coming in between 25% and 30% higher in value, both volume/price adjusted basis. So the new technology is rolling through. Of the ones that went in last year, be it 90%, over 25% of them have projects in place right now to put new transactions onto the UP as well as converting some of the historic load from classic to UP. Now, you don't turn the switch on this technology and that's why we went to the migration versus conversion. When people come and visit on the 14th and we take you through Analyst Day, you'll see that Linux phased up 2.1, right? It has about an 89%, 90% efficiency in hardware middleware to the existing program. So the economics to our customers are huge, right as it relates to that. And being you asked Scott about the $80 million contract, you can answer it.
Scott W. Behrens: Yes, I think what you're asking about is the $80 million deal that we signed in Q4 of last year, and kind of where that is in the process. That deal was an RPS deal. That's an example of the price uplift that we're getting on RPS deals. So of the $80 million, call it $50 million of it was renewal and $30 million of it was incremental value that we received on that. We have begun getting a revenue from that $30 million of five year incremental value. We've been getting that this year. So that deal is in backlog and that deal is getting -- we're getting the benefit of that this year, and it's a very good example of the price uplift power of the RPS program.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum.
George Sutton: Thank you. So as I look through your new bookings guidance for Q4, that implies a very significant growth rate in Q4 bookings. We're a month into the quarter and you're reiterating that, I just wondered if we can get a little better picture there.
Philip G. Heasley: I'd tell you a series of things on new bookings, right. One is, I think, you know that we've stretched out the renewal process to be a real renewal process, and we don't -- there has to be a really customer driven reason for us to do any early renewals. So that pretty much forces us to renew at the same quarter that it was put in, and that puts us back into lot of the renewals being fourth quarter because that's when the capital budgets were approved, God knows when, for them to do that. That's one piece of it. And you really have -- when you think of our business going forward in this year, you have to really separate the on premise business that has $2 billion in backlog and $600 million in revenue. And what that needs to get is single-digit revenue growth rates, and it's very renewal, and RPS can be RPTS, we will tell you about some new programs on the 14th. And that's very safe, that's very stable. And we have -- we can kind of measure that going out next quarter into next year. Then you look at the $400 million side of the business, which is the AOD side of the business, which also has $2 billion in backlog. Our focus there is much more in terms of harvesting revenue than it is. So, we've been growing bookings there faster than we can convert and -- that we can convert it from bookings to revenue. The focus there is going to be to equalize our booking ability with our ramping ability of the revenue. And so that -- you combine those two pieces there, and it says that bookings -- for several years, we had to drive bookings to build the backlog to produce revenue growth. Now bookings are a little bit subordinate to backlog and revenue conversion in terms of going forward. One other answer was that -- another answer to your question is that, we've actually booked quite a bit because first 10 -- Scott may have the exact number, but we got disoriented as well as a lot of other people from a bookings standpoint. And 10 days into September, we had landed up booking a lot of stuff that didn't book in the third quarter. And some of those deals were from Texas and other places that it was just not feasible to get it done with all the craziness going on at that point. But we're not hiding behind that because the differential between booking and revenue with us is on average over a year, right? So we don't view that 10 days or 20 days as a big deal, George.
George Sutton: I Understand, I think you meant October versus September, just to be clear?
Philip G. Heasley: No, no, no. We didn't book in September -- at the end of September when we had a little -- we were shut with the hurricane and well -- and it landed up booking in the first 10 -- do you know the number, Scott?
Scott W. Behrens: Yes, well I did, I think it was $40 million-ish.
Philip G. Heasley: $40 million-ish.
George Sutton: Got you, okay, great. And then relative to this Asian switch that you mentioned with 40 banks that ultimately would attach, can you just give us a sense of the addressable market there? What that could mean?
Philip G. Heasley: The addressable market initially is Asia, and I'm not going to -- I can't be any more -- so think of it is as ASEAN, Hong Kong and PRC. Pacific will probably join into it because there's lots of business between -- this is mostly a B2B mechanism. So there's a lot of business between specific and -- but the initial participants, without being overly descriptive, are going to be the major players, with ASEAN, Hong Kong, and PRC.
George Sutton: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Yeah, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Phil, could you try and help us follow on, on that last question. I just -- we continue to hear a lot of commentary about progress and we continue to hear about deals being signed, but if I am looking at it correctly, new bookings on a trailing fourth quarter basis are down something like 15%, backlogs have been down four quarters in a row. Help us figure out where is the tangible evidence that things are working here and that you can start to drive towards that multiyear growth goals that you've put out. I mean, as George said, we're looking at something like 40% to 50% bookings needed in the fourth quarter to get to your high single-digit bookings guidance. And so forgive me if I don't have complete faith, I need more evidence that we're actually getting there?
Philip G. Heasley: Well, faith is ambivalent as always, there's nothing wrong with that. If you look at our -- I think one thing that should make most people comfortable, if you look at our -- we publish in your package, the average term of our contracts that sit in backlog. And if you notice that over the last year, when we told you we were going to move from -- we were going to move right up to renewal date, that the average -- I think we've gone from 22 to 29 months, right? So what you see is that we are now through one year, anyhow, we've put it in there quarterly. We're now through one year of pushing out the renewal. And whether you renew at 48 months or you renew at 60 months, that doesn't change the slope of your growth, it's just that the average term per contract ends up getting much closer to it. And there's an awful lot of -- there's two reasons. You can judge us as doing it appropriately or not appropriately, but this fourth quarter is the last quarter of this current GAAP world that we have to live in from a -- which makes how we deal with renewals and ILFs very different than it's going to be next year. And our dependency on ILF as part of the renewal lands up going much, much more in our favor. So if you are like us and you are more value-oriented than just trying to maximize your current quarter, what you would do is, you’d push out to the end of your contracts and whatnot. And I think that somewhat masks our growth in revenue because we are telling you about these RPS renewals that are coming in at 25% to 30% above the replaced -- the contracts they are replacing, yet we are probably 20% -- 15% to 25% lower in ILF as a percent of new contract in terms of the renewals. So what we're doing is, we're really guaranteeing that growth in revenue, growth in EBITDA going forward, by the way we're shaping ourselves into the new accounting structure. And the accounting structure is only important to us because it gives us more leeway in negotiating these renewals. So yes, it does make that a -- that does make that a spike, doesn't change -- it doesn't change our commitments to growth in revenue, it doesn't change our commitments in growth to EBITDA. It actually somewhat makes that less risky from one to two years, three years out. Does make sense what I told you?
Peter Heckmann: Well, I understand some of the things that you're saying. And I understand ACI is a phenomenal cash flow machine with high retention, I’m just not seeing any evidence that the company can actually accelerate their revenue growth rate. And I may be dense in terms of some of the bookings or backlog metrics, but I'm just not seeing the evidence that we are going to see an acceleration in top line growth. And so if that's the case, well, that's fine, and you can pay a high dividend and pay down debt, but I think the mark-to-market is trying to figure out is, can you accelerate growth to that target range of mid-single digits within the next four to six quarters?
Philip G. Heasley: Scott?
Scott W. Behrens: The only thing I'd to add to that. Because you're looking at the comps versus last year, I think we have -- last year was a bit anomalous in a couple different ways. We had a preponderance of our revenue and EBITDA that we had to deliver in the fourth quarter. But we were ahead on bookings, we had especially a stronger first half last year. This year essentially flipped. Two to three quarters were up 8% in revenue, 63% in EBITDA, 94% cash flow. So we flipped. But the bookings, a lot of our bookings this year are going to come in what is traditionally strong fourth quarter. But less of that bookings will be required to convert to revenue in the year in order to hit our targets. So that -- the fourth quarter bookings is what's going to drive this year's backlog growth. So I wouldn't hold us to a rolling fourth quarter, and if you do, I'd take a look at the rolling fourth quarter revenue and EBITDA as well, very strong growth. But I would look at fourth quarter bookings as being -- it's going to go into the backlog and it's going to drive this year's backlog growth. So again, less dependence on those bookings to actually drive this year's revenue and EBITDA, which is a very good place to be right now. Most of those bookings would go in and drive that backlog growth and drive that future value.
Peter Heckmann: Okay, okay. And then if you humor me, just a few comments on 606 and if you’ve had any further ideas about how that might change your recognition of revenue and expenses directionally?
Scott W. Behrens: Yes, and it's -- on the -- pretty much on that, it's going to impact the on-premise side of the business. Maybe if I -- first, it was really not going to impact, really will not impact our on-demand business, won't impact things like bookings, cash flow. It will impact the on-premise business. It's the same as it is any on-premise software company. The subscription license fees under the new standard are going to be required to be recognized up front. And the sales commissions are going to be required to be deferred. So it's sort of an odd standard that says you accelerate your revenue and you defer your costs. But we're no different, we've put some pretty extensive disclosures in our SEC filings. But what you'll see is on what we call out as the monthly license fee revenue that will no longer be spread over the term of the arrangement that will be accelerated. It is pretty much similar to -- same impact of any on-premise software company.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. So the practical effect will be to reduce -- basically inject some additional volatility to quarter-to-quarter results?
Scott W. Behrens: Yes, it does because if you think about it theoretically, if we had with five year terms, if we had perfect distribution and 20% of the value of the portfolio renewed every year, 20% of those customers that pay subscription, you really would not see much change year-over-year. But it will introduce volatility and that the imperfection in that distribution will mean that when you have years with higher portfolio renewal rates, you're going to get a higher percentage of that go-forward revenue in years where you have a smaller percentage of that portfolio renew, you'll get less. So it will add quarterly, but it will also add to annual volatility a little bit.
Peter Heckmann: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Wayne Johnson from Raymond James.
Wayne Johnson: Hi, yes, good morning. Well done on the margins. So my follow-up is, I have a couple of follow-ups in that regard, so can you confirm, please, Phil if you want to take this, just where do we stand in the wind down of all those data centers, I thought it was 22, is that pretty much complete and through the system and we're seeing that impact with lower OPEX? And then the same is true, follow-up question on expenses, is confirming that the low-margin inherited contracts from prior acquisitions that those have completely rolled off, they're completely expired here in terms of their impact on the company and there should be a lower OPEX level here going forward?
Philip G. Heasley: We started out with -- if you add all the acquisitions up, we had 28 customer data centers. We now have four. But in order to get there, we had to close 26. And we are virtually done. We have a couple of more customers to move, not even data centers, we have a couple more centers to move and this has been a fun four years of continuous effort. And we have some people that we came pretty close to burning out on the process. As well as very significant investments in the cyber and encryption and that side of the business. The big interesting projects that we inherited from S1 are I think, Scott, I think we just shot acceptance from the last two of those, and those two are -- that group is behind us also, Wayne.
Wayne Johnson: Okay. That's helpful. And can you remind me how fast did the SaaS business grow in the most recent quarter?
Scott W. Behrens: Up 3% on the quarter.
Wayne Johnson: About 3%, and so -- and I apologize if I'm not thinking about this correctly, but I thought that, that was supposed to be one of the faster distribution channels that ACI was offering. So before I get into kind of a follow-up on the prior two analyst questions on the backlog, which I think in conversion of that, which I think is very valid, can we just talk a little bit about this, the SaaS side, please? What's happening there?
Scott W. Behrens: I would say, Wayne, there is seasonality to that business. That business is a lot more driven by transaction volume directly. So the quarter is up 3%, the year is up 6%. And so I think if we look at our mix of business, the SaaS is going to be growing at the higher end of our growth rate, with the on-prem at the lower end of our growth rates. But -- so year-to-date, we are up 6%.
Wayne Johnson: Okay. And then can we on the -- earlier in the year, I think, there was an announcement about Jack Henry and utilizing ACI, can you give an update on where we stand on that particular project?
Philip G. Heasley: We have a series of immediate payment projects around the world. And that's when I was referencing before, we're -- there is over a year of lag between booking that business and that business beginning to show up in revenue. So those businesses are not -- the immediate payments of those businesses have not gone live yet.
Wayne Johnson: Right, okay. And so where -- but is work ongoing, has work started? I'm just trying to frame in my mind on -- go ahead.
Philip G. Heasley: We are very -- I mean, some of the smaller -- we can't give you the names of customers, but some of the smaller deals are up and running at this point, and several of the big deals are close to being up and running. So we are well progressed Wayne. Don't expect revenue this year, but we expect revenue next year from those deals.
Wayne Johnson: And to essentially, it sounds like a big project. So essentially, to onboard all these banks, I think you said it was 10,000 financial institutions, if memory serves, what would be the timeline for that?
Philip G. Heasley: No, we just have to -- we have to facilitate. We facilitate financial intermediary, they facilitate -- they then go downstream to their banks.
Wayne Johnson: Totally understood, so -- and I appreciate that color, but how long do you think this is going to take them to do that as well? So it's a two-part question, I suppose.
Philip G. Heasley: Once we're connected to them, they have the connectivity to their people.
Wayne Johnson: Okay. So going back to the prior two analyst questions, I think that what investors like to see and I think what they were getting at and what I'm interested in is kind of like the mathematical staircase. So how do we get comfortable that the fourth quarter is going to deliver kind of the knockout blow here in terms of signing contracts to get to the numbers that you need to hit in order to annualize at that high single-digit rate for new bookings? So historically, fourth quarter has always been the seasonal highpoint for you guys. And so that's -- I think that's kind of the spirit of the questions, and I had the same question myself. So at the risk of kind of rehashing here, if there is any more color you can provide on that, I think investors would appreciate it as well.
Scott W. Behrens: Yes, I'd just reiterate what I said. I think if we look at on a comparable basis, you look at our key metrics, we're delivering substantially higher growth in revenue, EBITDA and cash flow for first nine months versus last year. The bookings will come in the fourth quarter, but this year's, the bookings for the first nine months were more correlated to delivering this year's revenue than the deals we have for the fourth quarter. So the position we are in is we don't -- we can deliver that sales bookings without having to convert a lot of that to revenue this year, it will go into backlog and it'll drive future year growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Condra from Credit Suisse.
Paul Condra: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Phil, I just wanted to ask about when you say some of the clients that you have that are running RPS now or UP, and they are putting some new transactions through, can you just talk about that a bit like, what's a new transaction relative to an existing transaction that they're migrating from an old system, is there something different about it?
Philip G. Heasley: Yes, so think of it this way. If you're ABC bank, you're a great big bank, and you are buying from us 500 million transactions a month, and it covers 40, 45, 50 different transaction types, and a lot of those transaction types are closed within their financial institutional or they're coming in, in existing markets. But now they are doing some new digital stuff and they're working with Syntax or they're working with this and that and they’ve put a little specialty switch in place, and it's got -- it's getting up to the point where it has 4 million to 5 million transactions a month or whatnot. And say, you're paying us you $0.001, $0.002 a transaction to do that. And you're paying $0.01 to $0.03 a transaction on that small switch, the economics of -- and that switch can do 30, 50 transactions per second and EPS can do 2,000 transactions per second, the -- moving that in has a huge cost of goods sold impact on those transactions. And as everyone is watching on the digital side of things as digital is becoming more and more real, the ability to support penny rate times kind of cost of goods sold is becoming very difficult because pricing is actually going down, not going up on -- this is the disruptive technology, that's flowing through. So if I have five or six or I have 10 or 15 of these little switches, and I have both the -- I have to manage them as they were scump works or they were viewed that they were open and whatnot, suddenly I take complexity out of my data center, I can move right to the Linux environment. I can get -- I can make it a one customer or a combined set of options because we offer the orchestration that says, how do you want to do this. Now, our new offering on the wholesale side says that we are now going to offer -- you can do a wire transfer or you can do an immediate payment and you can decide at the point of transaction how to do it by having the UP orchestration. On top of it, it's the same kind of situation. So it could be pay me later, it could be a whole host of different -- whole host of new and different digital kinds of offerings. If you're in the merchant retailer space, which is a little bit a field, but your ability to start doing omnichannel against the single switch so that card-present and card-not-present transactions will end up having a current common customer where the customer becomes the denominator and not the type of transaction becomes the denominator. There's a lot of incentive for you to move that volume over. So our old systems of the 1.6 trillion transactions that we think our systems are relevant to we're able -- we're touching about 35%, 40% of those transactions today. So we still have 60%, 65% eligibility for the rest of those without expanding, that's without expanding our future function, that's just giving new more efficient capability. Does that answer your question?
Paul Condra: Yes, that helps. I mean, I'm just trying to understand when you say new, you mean like net new transactions from the perspective of a bank or they're taking transactions from somewhere else and putting them through different...
Philip G. Heasley: So we have a major Midwest bank that we're working with right now, and they probably have eight or nine different systems. And you can’t just say, okay, at midnight on such a date we're going to convert over. Payments have to stay up 100% of the time. So you go type by type by type and type, and you move it over. And virtually every one of our customers has that capability in both the financial intermediary segment as well as the financial institution segment. And every retailer that wants to go to omnichannel, they have to do this because they have to marry their card-present and their card-not-present capabilities together.
Paul Condra: Got it, and then thanks for that. And the clearing house announced this new real-time -- trail, let me kind of put out our road map and I'm just curious if you had a view on that or if there is any kind of implications for your business?
Philip G. Heasley: Well, we're -- that's a major business line of ours. We are connecting people not only in United States, but all over the world we have immediate or instant whatever they want to call it, what part of the world. There's 40 countries in the world that are doing similar things. And that's very basically saying that ACH is not going to stay a batch transaction and it's not going to stay a pull, it's going to become much more of a push. And we're building that capability, that big switch that we're talking about in Asia, that's exactly what that -- that's exactly what it is. That looks like the clearing house switch in the United States.
Paul Condra: Okay, and then, Scott, I guess on to G&A, the $25 million is that a good run rate to think about, like looking at 2018 or is there any reason that's going to change much?
Scott W. Behrens: No, I think that's a good number for a run rate.
Paul Condra: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session for today. John Kraft, the floor is yours for any closing remarks.
John Kraft: Thanks everybody for calling in. We look forward to seeing everybody here in Naples on the 14th and upcoming conferences. Have a good day.

3;ACIW;2018-02-24;"Operator: Good morning. My name is Heidi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Reports Q4 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up to allow others time for their questions, and if you have further questions you may queue up again. Thank you. John Kraft, you may begin your conference.
John Kraft: Thanks, Heidi, and good morning, everybody. Today’s call, like all of our events, is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of the presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website, as well as with the SEC. On this morning’s call is Phil Heasley, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. Before we get started, I want to take -- make sure everybody knows that ACI will be attending the Raymond James 39th Annual Institutional Investor Conference in Orlando on March 6th and the Craig-Hallum FinTech Innovators Conference in Boston on March 15th. With that, I turn it all over to Phil.
Phil Heasley: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was the pivotal year for ACI on several levels. We achieved our revenue and profitability goals, security wins and celebrated numerous strategic customer goal lives. It was also a pivotal year internally for our company. We reorganized and introduced the new two P&L structure to better manage the growth and profitability of the business. I’m pleased to report that our 2017 results have validated best of this organizational approach. I’m going to spend the next few minutes providing deeper insight into 2017 and will focus my comments on three areas. First, I’ll share the progress in our ongoing journey to become the undisputed leader in global payment software. Second, I will go deeper into our new P&L, two P&L structure and why it’s fundamental to our go forward plans. And third, I’ll highlight the key wins in 2017 and opportunities for 2018 and beyond. First, our journey, ACI has worked for the better part of 10 years to build the non-rival end-to-end software portfolio that meets the real time any to any payment needs of our core custom -- core customer segments, banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporations. While providing a look back of 10 years maybe unusual on an earnings call, I believe in showing how ACI plans and executes on a long-term horizon. In my view, building values is always rewarded over time as was the case in 2017. We have acquired and integrated nine companies since 2011, as well as managed divestiture, asset sales, the loan service projects and wind down of non-core revenue. To meet increasing demand for cloud delivery, we built out four core data centers in the U.S. and Europe, investing heavily in cybersecurity and state-of-the-art infrastructure, in the process we’ve migrated and closed more than 25 smaller locations, most of which were inherited via acquisition. These were very significant tasks, which taxed our people and impacted our customers and I sincerely thank our 1 ACI staff and our patient customers for their support during this journey. As we entered 2017, we saw several of these efforts rewarded. First and foremost the UP strategy was validated. We saw 100% adoption rate for our UP Retail Payment Solution program which bridges customers to our powerful UP technology. RPS enables our customer to lever their investment in existing systems and migrate transaction volumes to the ACI’s next-generation solutions at their own pace. We initiated 13 projects last year that were directly related to the RPS renewals. In 2017, customers continue to activate the UP components of RPS, driving 25% to 30% total contract value uplift for these renewals. The UP strategy produced a quarter of last year’s revenue and a fifth of the 60-month backlog. We expect these numbers to increase steadily as we progress through the renewal cycle. Continuing with the theme of our journey, one of our strategic technology initiatives over the last several years has been to port our solutions Linux, starting with UP Retail Payments two years ago. Running on Linux enables our customers to save 75% to 90% on hardware and middleware investments. Across our portfolio, four of our six UP Solutions now run on Linux. While year-end Linux solution releases may have slowed some bookings during the year, they increased the pipeline for ‘18. These improvements were worth the wait for our customers. Another milestone in our journey was delivery of the next-generation of Universal Online Banker, ACI’s cloud-based multitenant digital banking solution. This enhanced offering has already won several awards and we expect strong bookings to follow. We also continued developing our UP Merchant Payments platform, offering which encompasses omni-channel, risk management, card present and card not present offerings. These new releases may also have slowdown 2017 bookings, but they’re adding significantly to our pipeline and improving implementation times. Moving to my second topic, I’d now like to discuss the two P&L structure that we rolled out in 2017. This structure allows us to better manage costs and profit margins related to operating our solutions, acquiring new customers and building new solutions for our On Premise and On Demand cloud delivery models. Throughout the year, we also fine tune the operations and teams within the P&Ls, and restructured and re-enhanced our global sales capabilities. Revenue in ACI is more mature On Premise P&L, where our software is operated on a customer’s premise for a six-year term grew 1% and represents 58% total revenue. While many customers prefer utilizing our ACI cloud, our On Premise business also continues to grow particularly given the value we’re recreating with our RPS and real-time payment solution, RTPS. Within ACI’s On Demand P&L, which ACI’s cloud business, revenue grew 7% and now represents 42% of total revenue. This is up from 17% five years ago. Excluding corporate overhead, ACI’s On Premise segment generated 58% EBITDA margin, up from 53% in 2016. ACI’s On Demand segment with all its recent investments generated negative 1% EBITDA margin related to the journey I discussed a few minutes ago, ACI On Demand was clearly impacted the most by the acquisition integration and data center consolidations that we have now completed. That said, it’s key to focus on the opportunity in our On Demand segment. At our recent Analyst Day, we discussed our goal of achieving the Rule of 40s in ACI’s On Demand business. In other words, a revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin that when added together equate to 40% or better. With our three-tier profit model, we can optimize the margin to operate, the margin to acquire, and the margin to build, thus effectively manage to the Rule of 40. This provides three additional drivers outside the box of pure revenue growth. On the margin side, the investments to deliver major product update in late 2017 are complete. Our extensive data center build-out and cybersecurity investments are largely finished, and the fixed cost structure of these data centers can absorb many years of transaction volume growth. Further, our Linux environment reduces the step function cost to future service, storage and communications. We will show significant margin improvements over the next few years while continuing to stay at the cutting edge of payments technology, including efforts and block chain in Linux. We have a lot of work to do and the Rule of 40 goal is very much within our reach. Lastly, let me now discuss some of the more significant contracts signed in quarter four. These examples are representative of strategic payment opportunities we’re seeing across our four core customer segments, banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporations, and all involved notable increases in total contract value. In North America, our largest bank customer and our second largest financial intermediary customer both signed RPS renewals. With these renewals means that two of the top five bank customers, as well as our two largest financial intermediary customers have all selected RPS, providing a powerful validation of the RPS program and the value it provides to our customers. Also in quarter four another longstanding customer signed an RPS renewal and also added anti-fraud and data management solutions. In Latin America, key e-commerce customer renewed and added several anti-fraud modules. In Asia, three large domestic banks and one large domestic financial intermediary all renewed with significant RPS contracts. Well the renewals were notable for incremental transaction value and contract value we also signed a significant net new business, including our largest Bill Payment contract ever with the domestic based specialty finance company. Other notable wins include an existing North American customer that signed a significant new contract with ACI to power real-time payments and secure person-to-person payments. Specifically, this large bank will use ACI’s technology as a strategic payment hub, which will include access to The Clearing House’s real-time payment network. Given global momentum and new regulations mandating real-time payments schemes, the interest in our real-time payment solutions is high. Our investments over the last several years in immediate and real-time payment type uniquely positioned ACI to capitalize on this high growth opportunity. Leveraging this momentum, we’re already off to a fast start in 2018. Half way through quarter one Q1, we have basically generated the same bookings as we did in all of quarter one 2017. In Asia, this month, we celebrated a major system go live of our UP Immediate Payment Solutions at DBS Bank, the largest bank in Southeast Asia. And we signed a new contract with the international subsidiary of China UnionPay, one of the world’s largest and fastest growing payment providers. In Europe, we’ve been officially selected to provide the payment platform for one of the world’s largest merchants. In summary, 2017 was a breakout year with revenue acceleration already underway in 2018. In closing, we believe our desire to deleverage and keep our share count constant will be well rewarded. We have virtually the same number of outstanding shares today as we did 10 years ago. Financially strong and position to accelerate margin improvement, ACI is entering a period of profitability and cash flow growth. EBITDA and cash flow will provide -- will prove to be the key drivers of value in 2018 and 2020 timeframe. We continue to plan for strong EBITDA and cash flow this year and beyond, and are excited about our ability to drive shareholder value. Scott will now give details on 2017, our guidance for 2018 and our EBITDA outlook for 2019 and 2020. With that, I’ll pass the baton to him for his financial comments.
Scott Behrens: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through our results for 2017 and then provide guidance for 2018, as well as our longer range outlook for EBITDA in 2019 and 2020. We’ll then open the line for questions. I’ll be starting my comments on slide six with key takeaways from the year. Our full year new bookings were $619 million and total bookings were $1.1 billion. While we saw some customers delayed signings in the early 2018, we did get a lot done during the quarter achieving our second highest ever quarterly bookings number, second only to Q4 2016. And as Bill said, we have started 2018 with strong bookings and expect our first quarter to show strong growth over Q1 of last year. Our 60-month backlog grew $16 million and represents $4.1 billion and our 12-month backlog stands at $825 million. Full year revenue was $1.024 billion up 3% over last year after adjusting for foreign currency and the CFS divestiture. This was at the high end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year and looking at our two P&Ls, our SaaS and platform business saw revenue growth of 7% and now represents 42% of total revenue, while our On Premise business grew 1% and represents 58% of total revenue. This revenue growth contributed to strong EBITDA growth which was up 9% from last year and exceeded our guidance range. In 2017 our net EBITDA margin was 30%, up roughly 200 basis points from last year’s, as we’re starting to see the margin generation capability to both scale and the heavy investments that we’ve made in new products and infrastructure in recent years. From a segment perspective excluding corporate overhead, ACI’s On Premise generated 58% EBITDA margin and ACI’s On Demand segment generated a negative 1% EBITDA margin for the year. 2017 was a strong year for cash flow growth, cash flow from operating activities was $146 million, up 46% for the year and our operating free cash flow, after adjusting for CapEx was up 80% over last year. We ended the year with $70 million in cash and a debt balance of $696 million, which is down $57 million this year and as we exit 2017, we’re at the lowest leverage ratio we’ve had over the past five years. During Q4 and in the early part here of 2018, we repurchased 3 million shares of ACI stock or roughly $68 million, and today announced that we have reloaded our share repurchase authorization to $200 million. Turning next to slide seven, let me take a few moments to discuss how ACI has impacted by the recent tax and accounting changes. First, regarding the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In Q4 2017, ACI took a non-cash charge, the revaluation and write-down of our net deferred tax assets, given the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. In addition, we reported to charge for the new tax on unremitted foreign earnings. We expect to utilize available foreign tax credits to offset any cash obligation. Therefore, we do not expect any impact to 2018 free cash flow as a result of the act. In 2018, we expect an effective GAAP tax rate of roughly 20% as the U.S. tax rate falls closer in line with the tax rate and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our cash taxes will remain low as we continue to utilize our acquired U.S. NOLs for which we have $100 million remain. Moving next to the new accounting rules, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606, which replaces ASC 605. As previously disclosed, we have adopted the modified retrospective approach and will present our key financial results on both the new and old basis for 2018. The bulk of these changes will impact two specific areas. First, as it relates to revenue, our On Premise license fees paid monthly and yearly will now be recognized all upfront rather than it’s paid on a monthly or yearly basis over time. While this will not impact our cash flows, it will impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized. The quarterly phasing will also be impacted as we’ll recognize all of our license fees in the quarter the deal are signed, which is obviously heavily weighted towards the second half year. On the cost side, we’ll now be required to recognize sales commissions ratably versus expense upfront as we have done previously. We will not see any impact to our bookings or cash flow metrics under the new rules and generally speaking we will not see an impact for our On Demand segment as those SaaS and platform revenues and cash flows will continue to be ratable as they have in the past, and again, for 2018, we’ll report our key financial results on both the new and old basis. Turning next to slide eight, with our 2018 guidance, in addition to reporting actual results under both the new and old GAAP, we’ll also provide our forward guidance under both as well, starting with our guidance under historical accounting or ASC 605. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be in a range of $1.05 billion to $1.075 billion, which represents 3% to 5% growth over 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $270 million to $285 million, which excludes approximately $5 million to $7 million in significant transaction-related expense and we expect to generate between $210 million and $220 million of revenue in the first quarter under ASC 605. Under the new accounting standards, we expect revenue in 2018 to be between $1.03 billion and $1.055 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $255 million to $270 million. And we expect to generate between $200 million and $210 million of revenue in the first quarter under ASC 606. And to help with your modeling, you’ll find additional guidance assumptions on slide nine, new bookings are expected to grow in the low-double digits for the full year 2018, which is above our trend line, but we expect 2018 to compensate for the anomaly we saw in 2017 bookings. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million and cash interest of $34 million. Capital expenditures are expected to approximately $50 million, continuing the downward trend of the last couple of years. Depreciation and amortization is expected to approximate $100 million, non-cash compensation to approximate $30 million and cash taxes should approximate $40 million. Pass-through interchange should be in a range of $170 million to $175 million, and lastly, our diluted share count should approximate $160 million, which excludes any future share buyback activity. And finally, turning to page 10, we’re providing you our long range outlook for adjusted EBITDA targets beyond 2018. We expect a leverage in the business model that’s beginning to show up in our EBITDA growth are driven by both scale, as well as our focus on the Rule of 40s for our SaaS and platform business to continue to drive EBITDA expansion. We see that trend continuing beyond 2018 and are targeting EBITDA on 2019 to be in a range of $300 million to $350 million and in 2020 to be in the range of $335 million to $350 million. So, in summary, we generated revenue at the high end of our guidance, EBITDA in excess of our guidance. That strong EBITDA growth and resulting strong cash flow generation was used in part that continue to pay down debt, resulting in our lowest leverage ratio in five years. We also purchased 3 million shares of our stock and are well-positioned with our reloaded 200 million share repurchase authorization. And finally, we believe we are well-positioned for EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation in 2018 and beyond. So that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Sutton with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.
Jason Kreyer: Hey gentlemen. Good morning. It’s Jason on for George.
Phil Heasley: Hi, Jason.
Jason Kreyer: So you’ve mentioned in your prepared remarks, you’d said that the bookings pipeline is larger than ever. And just wondering if you can give some specifics on you know where you see that composition. I know you ran through some things in your script, but what are the drivers of that bookings pipeline?
Phil Heasley: Well, yeah, I have to get back into ‘17 to answer that. I actually have to get all the way back to ‘16 a little bit to answer that question. The fact that our bookings are in a strong as they could and should be on a -- on our trend line is largely impacted by four things that ACI did to itself. We announced -- we told you in the last year at this time that we had deliberately strategically closed the gap on our renewals and said that we’re only going to do renewals in the year of renewals and that the RPS program was driving that and it was a major -- and in fact instead of working on two years of renewals, we doubled down and working on one-year renewals, because bridging everyone to the new technology was a task number one, objective number one. So, that in itself slowed down bookings, because we in fact cut even though our pipe -- our renewals were there and we’re running it close to 100% renewal. We shut -- we basically shut half of the amount of renewals we’d against. Second one was that we made it very clear that the marketplace that we’re coming out with significant new GAs in 2017 and we did the two analyst meetings since -- without trying to signal to all of our competitors and what not that we were out of the market on digital and we were -- we had slowed down our efforts on the other platform GAs. We did that because we wanted to have the Linux offering and the values that came from the Linux offerings. So that slowed down our bookings also. The third area which shouldn’t be underestimated is we reorganized into the two P&L structure. We went from one salesforce to three salesforce. Now we separated renewals from cross-sell and we separated both of those from our business development. There’s significant interest in our UP technology and we weren’t organized in a way to directly confront that and so we went through trying to use the Olympic analogy we were in the hockey game and we did try to score a point, because we’re changing lines, right, and so I wouldn’t underestimate that. And then the last one was coming into the fourth quarter, we did not -- we have -- we are a way too in my opinion, we’re a way too dependent on the fourth quarter and when we’re satisfied with the revenue from sales, we had no reason to be making less than optimum -- optimal deals closing out the year and that’s why I stick on to you that’s the --that the first quarter is already at last year’s first quarter level and what not. And so those four reasons or all reasons why -- so on a go forward basis, if you don’t -- it slow down -- all those reasons had nothing whatsoever to do with bookings or pipeline. We’ve been winning awards for our new technology and in fact one just crossed the wire this morning. We think that that the R&D was the right move. We think the reorganization was the right move. The focus on the two pieces of business was the right move. We -- RPS is validating itself as being the right move. And the fourth quarter where I’d really like to spread more the business in the other three quarters of the year than just wait for everyone’s budgets to get approved and have a rare mad dash to signing contracts.
Jason Kreyer: Great color on that. Thank you. Just one more question for me the decision to provide the long-term guidance for 2019 and 2020, that’s not something we’ve seen from you guys in the past. So it would appear that’s coming from more confidence in the pipeline going forward, but just give me your thoughts on why you chose to provide that level of guidance?
Phil Heasley: Well, I think, it doesn’t -- everything, it supports everything we said, right. So I’m not going to reiterate a bunch of what we said. I think there is another way to look at it. We just bought back 3% of our stock and we put out the authority to buy back another 7% of our stock. We think that -- we do a very disciplined discounted cash flow in terms of when we buy earnings per share, right. Think about it that way or EBITDA per share. And we can’t -- we’re having a real hard time finding anything that’s more attractive than our own EBITDA per share and I don’t want to get into a lawsuit or whatever that says that we’re being overly huge in terms of how we’re going after that.
Scott Behrens: Yeah. Jason, the only other thing I’d add is, I think, providing this is a natural progression of what we’ve been talking about now for essentially about the last year. It was last year about this time that we introduced our two P&L segments for the On Premise and our SaaS and platform business. When we met in November in -- at Analyst Day, we talked about the Rule of 40s and our commitments to getting the cloud business to the Rule of 40. And I said at that time over the course of the five years, we have EBITDA growth targets out there of 100 basis points, but the quicker we can get traction on the Rule of 40, we’re going to move that needle probably a little higher than 100 basis points. And so that’s a part of the reason to put it out there for 2019 and 2020 was to kind of get some direction to where we think our ability to execute on the Rule of 40s and how it will drive in particular the profitability of our cloud business.
Phil Heasley: And you see the cash that the company is generating and we have to be holistic -- we have to be clear with all the options we have for that cash.
Jason Kreyer: Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with Davidson. Please go ahead.
Peter Heckmann: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for providing that longer term guidance. I think that’s a bold move, it’s something that the market will welcome. But as we try and model towards those numbers, can you help us a little bit thinking about what type of revenue growth might be contemplated at the lower and higher ends of those longer term EBITDA guidance ranges?
Scott Behrens: Yeah. Well, for -- certainly for 2018, we’ve obviously guided to 3% to 5% revenue growth. We said over the five years that we’re talking mid-to-upper single digits. So I think what you’ll see in ‘19 and ‘20 is a progression, 2018 is the baseline towards that mid-to-upper single-digit revenue growth.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. And…
Scott Behrens: But I -- it is really, but there’s two dynamics to, I guess, our ability to deliver on those EBITDA targets. One is going to be revenue growth, but the other is going to be the efficiency and the optimization of our cloud business. So, again, we put a lot of investment in the past into product development, as well as infrastructure costs and we’re at -- we’re now going into the three-year period or so that we’re going to be able to see the dividends in that set. So I really see it as a combination of both the revenue growth and cost optimization that will help us on delivering on those targets.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. Okay. And then is there a minimum level of bookings in 2018 that you need to get to achieve those 2019 numbers, I mean, if let’s say we have a year of flat bookings in 2018 on a relatively easy comp, how much will that effect to you guys.
Phil Heasley: Well, when you -- going forward even so ‘17 was a leap year, from a 60-month backlog standpoint, we still replenished -- we still replenished the backlog and it grew a little tiny bit. So that would be the baseline that you want to start with. We’ve been stocking away into backlog more than revenue growth for the three years before that, so you think that. The AOD business, the historic On Premise business of ours very much follows the bookings backlog, revenue, revenue generation and out, and that’s going to stay very predictable in that way. The AOD business is going to have full organic revenue growth and bookings response as drivers of its increased revenue. So we’re expecting very good bookings growth right and like we said, if you add ‘18 and ‘17 together and divided by two, we feel very confident we’re going to be on trajectory. AOD has another mechanism by which its -- they are in the transaction business and it’s not a fixed multiyear contract. It’s a floor right and the whole idea is to beat that floor and to get as much share in the digital transformation as possible and then roll off of that chair. And the growth in real time payment has not been disappointing anybody in terms of forecast versus actual in terms of organic growth should be a bigger piece. And yeah, we should be comfortable that take ‘17 and ‘18, divide them by two and we feel comfortably on that trajectory.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. And then just last question, I didn’t totally understand your comment on the renewals piece, I see it in the bookings numbers, term extensions, and perhaps, the upgrade were both lower. But what was the comment on was it less focused on renewals and more focused on the deployment?
Phil Heasley: No, no, no. I apologize. What I said was we traditionally go out and we aggressively renew contracts in their third year and fourth year. We in the end of ‘16 changed that and said that with the complexity of RPS and bring -- combining the old and the new technology isn’t we want to come out of this cycle with everybody operating on UP. We -- in effect said, we’re only going to work on current year. And of course, when you only work a lot of our new business our core new business comes from the add-on of renewal business. So when you, say, well, gee, I’m only going to renew half of it that not only impacts renewals, it also impacts the add-on and additional capacity that is purchased. Does that make sense?
Peter Heckmann: It does. It does. So…
Phil Heasley: Yeah.
Peter Heckmann: … as in prior quarters or prior period is that that business is still locked in, there hasn’t been an increase in cancellations, we will just…
Phil Heasley: No. Our attrition rate is virtually zero.
Peter Heckmann: Yeah. So we have a high-level of confidence, we will see those come through in ‘18 or ‘19?
Phil Heasley: Yeah.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. Thank you.
Phil Heasley: Yeah.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good morning, guys. One question on the success you had in the 4Q, I think, you mentioned Phil, it seems to us it’s a very big deal that you closed. I think you said your largest North American bank and your second largest financial intermediary, which I think, you also ultimately referred to as a bank. Is that my understanding on that right?
Phil Heasley: No. We now have two of the top five bank customers around the world, that are up-enabled RPS and we have both the number one and the number two financial intermediaries, which they very much support banks, right. But they are financial intermediaries. They’re across the line as up-enabled.
Brett Huff: Okay. So the -- our big focus has been on the second big bank that we thought you would close. It sounds like you did that in the fourth quarter here in the U.S. And I don’t understand why the backlog in bookings number or specifically why the bookings number wouldn’t have been much better given at least our understanding of how big those contracts are and you were talking about 25% to 30% lift on those contracts. I don’t understand how that math doesn’t flow through to that bookings number. I’m just confused on that lack of flow through?
Phil Heasley: Well, a little bit of that has to do with yoking back the number, the number of renewals. Now, we’re definitely not going to talk about individual contracts. We’ve got our customers would be upset. But we also did you know, so basically what we’ve done is we look for 25% to 30% and I don’t think there’s any, no, no real secret. The number we’ve achieved is 28% and that’s a combination of, it’s almost all buying incremental volume. Now that that lands up and what we’ve done is, we actually take a slightly -- we’ve taken a slightly lower ILF, so there’s less revenue impact on the current year. But it gives us a nice 5% plus growth rate over the duration of the contract, because if you think about 28% provided by five-year contract, you’re going to get 5% in change. By giving them the new technology on top of the old technology, I said that, we had 13 contracts that followed, most of which are from fourth quarter ‘16, first quarter ‘17 bookings. As they start adding more volumes into it, they then contract us or they do it themselves or they contract us to work on them on projects to bring more volume in, right. I guess the best way -- you want to add on?
Scott Behrens: Yeah. Brett, the only thing I’d add to that is that when you’re looking at comparable to Q4 2016, remember that Q4 2016 we actually signed our largest deal ever, which came with a renewal, but it was substantial term extension event, as well as the substantial new bookings event. So we had one of those customers that Phil talks about being RPS was signed in Q4 ‘16. So, there is a fairly large comparable amount in the comp period.
Brett Huff: Okay. And second question is -- that’s helpful. Thanks for that insight. Second question is we had guided to high single-digit net new bookings for this year. By my math it came in down mid-teens and even though you’re guiding for low double-digit growth for next year on that lower base. By my math, we’re still $125 million to $150 million lower in absolute booking dollars in ‘18 than would have been had you kind of kept on your existing trend line. That’s also confusing to me and is there just a general delay or are we being conservative on the low double next year for ‘18. Where does that $150 million go?
Scott Behrens: Yeah. Two things, well, first of all, low double, probably, a wider range than maybe what you’re computing. But in terms of -- and it still goes back to what we’re seeing in Q1. Q1, we are seeing, as Phil said, I mean, we’re nearly at the level of bookings we have for all of the first quarter last year. So we’re going to see strong comps here early in the year and I think that that makes it different. I think, historically where we had deal slipped from year-to-year, they slipped, they took with them revenue and margin. That wasn’t the case this year. So deals -- these deals slipped were deals that likely would have driven just it would have gone straight in the backlog and would have likely gone into projects status delivered revenue for each year. So the fact that we’re signing those now in the first six weeks of the year, really doesn’t knock this off path, because again a lot -- most of that would have gone to backlog and into a project status delivered at some point in the future.
Brett Huff: Okay. And then last question from us, despite a little bit lower license mix than usual, Phil, I think, you mentioned, you guys had a lot of success in one -- quarter one through quarter three in getting some of the renewals done or the higher margin stuff done. The license mix wasn’t as favorable yet, you guys really had great not particularly COGS leverage but OpEx leverage. What was driving that and I don’t know if that’s for Phil or for Scott, but on all three lines or four lines of OpEx, much lower than we expected in. What drove that -- should we think about that going forward and maybe is that implied in sort of your longer term EBITDA guidance?
Scott Behrens: Well, yeah, I think, if you look at and just say relative to the midpoint of our guidance or relative [ph] 3% (42:30) it’s a lot of that excess revenue that we achieved did deliver bottomline EBITDA. But I think it gets into the scale in the leverage of the model. And again a lot of that investment that we’ve made in the past is not only coming to a natural ends, but it’s also -- those investments were also into driving high amount of incremental dollar will drop to the bottomline. So, it’s really the scale and the leverage of those investments we start to see.
Phil Heasley: Brett, I also want to answer it, because it’s one of the reason I put you guys through a long set of comments this morning. When you buy 11 companies and what you’re really trying to buy is his capabilities and whatnot, and you’ve got a real vision for what it is you want to build. What you’ll end up having to do is you’ll end up having to divest, you’ll end up having to do one-time kinds of tests and whatnot to make those 11 companies and your core company one company. And one thing that we’ve not done a great job of explaining to the street is that we’ve actually -- our gross revenue -- gross is a bad term, I think. But the amount of revenue growth that we’ve had for the last three years, four years has been offset by revenue that we’ve driven out of the business, because we discontinued one of S1’s major online business lines, but we weren’t going to put a flag out in front of the building and we weren’t going to -- we have to work it logically out with our customers, a lot of whom we continue with other products and whatnot. So if we are driving out revenue that has little to no margin and then we’re growing good business that has margin, it looks like you don’t have that much of a revenue growth rate, because on a net day basis you don’t. But what it does to your EBITDA, so once it’s gone its expenses go away and its revenue went away, but the marginal effect becomes a multiplier and that’s what you’re beginning to see. And the other one was is that closing those 25 data centers and building out the four. We went through a bunch of cost that we expect efficiency. We’re also expecting leverage against that fixed cost investment in those. We have years of growth before we have to readdress those centers in the way we did just now.
Brett Huff: Okay. That’s helpful. And last one for me. What are the kind of the upsides, downsides that might drive better or worse than the, I think, what you guys are seeing is a low double-digit range, and Scott, I don’t know if you want to comment, you mentioned that maybe it’s -- I don’t know you implied it was more mid-teens in your prior comment. But what would drive upside and downside to that? We’ve gotten some questions, just how conservative is that outlook now, because folks are trying to get a handle on what is the right kind of bookings run rate? Thank you.
Phil Heasley: Well, I’ll give you a couple of things and then I will let Scott as our CFO give you a couple of things. We have no -- merchants and banks are probably two of the biggest recipients of the tax reductions. And whereas merchants have been investing, they’ve been investing in what they can afford and it’s possible that they’ll invest more, right. Banks really under this regulatory regime of the last eight years have invested little to nothing that they didn’t have to invest against the regulatory scheme. And that has not been positive. We have a lot of customers that need to do transformational kinds of projects and they have just been below the regulatory regime in terms of things that they can do and whatnot, that’s potentially a positive. And the best way I can say that is that after a couple of years of saying, well, gee, we’ve got this great technology, people are just going to come and do huge deals with us and forecast that as part of our business going forward. In 16 week we quit doing that. So when we talk about our growth rates and whatnot, they are not dependent on any elephant or well-sized initiatives that are out there and those would be -- on the negative side is that something happens to severely injure, the banks get in trouble again or something, but I can’t really forecast that one.
Scott Behrens: Yeah. The only thing I’d add to that is that, I agree on the downside it would be something macroeconomic. On the upside though, we’re -- there’s a lot of drivers of upside. We’re entering the year three of our RPS program, where we’re getting the 25%, 30% price uplift. So that’s -- and that’s been very high, nearly 100% adoption rate. So that’s really subject to the pool of renewals we have each year. And so, again, in year three of that, we just introduced our real time payment solutions. So not on the retail side, but more on the wholesale side of payments, that’s structured very similar to the RPS program. And that’s -- this will be the first full year of that program. And then, just overall the new product release. So the Linux capabilities, as well as the new digital banking solution are really what will drive the upside.
Brett Huff: Okay. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
David Eller: Good morning. And, Phil, thank you for all the commentary and the slides to start the call. Scott, on the share repo, typically you’ve held 75% to 80% of your cash offshore and I wondered if you could give us some context related to Tax Reform on how efficiently or quickly you might be able to bring that cash back and then if there’s any timeline related to the new $200 million authorization?
Scott Behrens: Well, we historically had a generally pretty efficient tax structure, meaning the ability to get cash back from overseas. So I don’t necessarily look at that cash is being trapped for any particular reason. Obviously, we’re going to be in a more flexible position going forward, because now it’s already is a part of the unremitting earnings tax. So there’s still working capital requirement for where we operate in 50 countries. So there’s certainly an element of working capital required to be overseas and then certain jurisdictions have, it’s not that we tax that when it comes in to the U.S. They tax it when it leaves the country. So there’s those kind of dynamics. So I don’t think in and of itself the tax law will impact that again, so efficient structure certainly more flexibility going forward because essentially it’s already been taxed. And in terms of the $200 million authorization, the only thing I’d say to that is, of course, of the last, call it 90 days we’ve purchased 3 million shares. Yes, we have 200 million as of today available and I would just reiterate what, Phil said, we look at our stock and what we’re seeing in our future is a very compelling use of our cash. So, I think, that’s as much as I’d say about any timing of use of that…
Phil Heasley: I’ll give you a little add-on to that. If you take a backwards look at us, we’ve purchased about 40 million of our shares and this is actually a pattern to how we buy back our shares. So, if you take backwards look you could might make a forward interpolation in terms of this and that might be the best way to answer the question.
David Eller: Okay. Thank you for that color. And then you also mentioned that you continue to have $100 million of net operating losses that you can use after Tax Reform, can you give us any kind of estimate of when you might exhaust those or kind of what -- how long you might be able to use those going forward?
Scott Behrens: Well, there -- there’s no limit, right. There’s no risk at this point in terms of our future earnings that we would lose any of the availability of that. We have really a couple more years of pretty heavy utilization on those. Before that -- some of those limitations drop off and get out to 2020, but what we’ve got a couple more years of pretty heavy utilization.
David Eller: Okay. And then, last question for me about housekeeping. I think in prior years you’ve provided a specific free cash flow number in your guidance and I think you’ve given us a lot of the kind of assumptions that we can drive to that, but did you provide a free cash flow number for this year?
Scott Behrens: Same -- it’s very similar to what we’ve done in the past. All the components, I think are on slide nine. If you -- but if you do what we call kind of the sanity check math, where we start with EBITDA, which is again we’ve guided to range to $270 million to $285 million, and then you reduce it really to three major cash components being the cash taxes of $40 million and interest of $34 million and CapEx around $50 million, you get in that high $150 million range, so the growth is -- should be commensurate with our EBITDA growth.
David Eller: Okay. Thank you so much for taking my questions.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Wayne Johnson with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Wayne Johnson: Hi. Yes. Thank you for all these data points. Very helpful. Just in case I missed it in the beginning part of the call, did you give any guidance in terms of how we should think about research and development, sales and marketing as a percentage of sales going forward in 2018?
Phil Heasley: We are not contemplating reducing our R&D spending. I mean, I wish we were three times our size, because there’s so much going on out there, right. We are not reducing R&D commitment.
Wayne Johnson: Okay. Should I take that just to say we can map out a 2017 percentage of sales overlay and ‘18 and we’re going to be within the ballpark. What you guys are thinking in terms of operating expenses?
Scott Behrens: I had a hard time hearing that question. Are you still typically talking about the R&D?
Wayne Johnson: Just operating expenses in general, so sales and marketing and R&D together, if -- should we just take ‘17 and overlay that on to ‘18, as a percentage of sales and use that as a guideline or starting point for modeling?
Scott Behrens: Yeah. I think, well, two things. I think R&D as a percentage of revenue should be essentially consistent with 2017. I would expect selling and marketing spend should go up, commensurate with the higher booking. So just all else being equal, I think, sales expense should go up commensurate with higher bookings numbers.
Wayne Johnson: I appreciate that. And what was the recurring revenue and I apologize I’m offsite, but what was the recurring revenue for 2017, when you look at the whole year?
Scott Behrens: I’m sorry. I still didn’t hear.
Phil Heasley: Recurring revenue. What was ‘17’s recurring revenue?
Scott Behrens: The recurring revenue?
Wayne Johnson: Yeah. The percent of total?
Phil Heasley: 70 some.
Scott Behrens: Yeah. We can get that. It was, yeah, so it was $725 million, $726 million out of the $1.24 billion, so 70%-ish.
Phil Heasley: Yeah. It’s really a...
Wayne Johnson: And so -- and we should expect that percentage to creep up over time, is that correct?
Scott Behrens: Well, yeah, I think, all else being equal. It will, I think, you look at 2017, where you saw a lot of the recurring growth was in the -- in our SaaS platform business up 7%, that’s all recurring revenue. So generally speaking over time as we sell net new we grow volumes, those will all drive to whether it’s cloud or it’s On Premise, those will drive incremental recurring revenue stream.
Wayne Johnson: Okay. I appreciate that. I’ll follow-up offline. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions in the queue.
John Kraft: Well, thanks everybody for calling in. We look forward to catching up and seeing everybody in upcoming events. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.";[0.03870966101205475, 0.07270253585317987];0.07270253585317987;0.03870966101205475;0
4;ACIW;2018-05-12;"Operator: Good day. My name is Elsa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. John Kraft, you may begin your conference.
John Kraft: Thanks, Elsa, and good morning, everybody. Today’s call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text to both statements on our first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning’s call is Phil Heasley, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Phil.
Philip Heasley: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I’ll spend the next few minutes providing deeper insight into quarter one. I’ll focus my comments on customer and market trends through the lens of ACI’s two P&Ls, six solutions and four customer segments by sharing wins that highlight our global traction. I will then turn the call over to Scott for the financial review. Jumping right in. I’m pleased to report that ACI is off to a strong start in 2018. Our total bookings increased $82 million, or 44% over quarter one 2017. Organizations across each of our four target customer segments, banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporates, continued to select ACI as the trusted provider to power their real-time, any-to-any payment needs. We achieved outstanding new bookings in the first quarter with $215 million, or 142% growth and our 60-month backlog hit an all-time high at $4.4 billion. The new bookings represent more than 25 new logos across our six solution areas. In addition, our pipeline continues to grow and we expect the strong bookings environment to continue throughout 2018. The $215 million in new bookings growth and the $82 million overall growth difference is totally explained by the shape of our renewals 2017 versus 2018. I’ll move now to our two P&Ls. Within our ACI On Demand P&L, we saw a continued momentum for our cloud-based payment solutions. Bookings for our UP Merchant Payments and UP Bill Payment Solutions were particularly strong, validating the investments we made over the last few years in expanding our UP Solutions portfolio, filling out four core data centers and strengthening our cybersecurity capabilities. ACI On Demand segments grew revenue 6% over last year with an 800 basis point improvement in adjusted net EBITDA margin. As I’ve mentioned on past calls, we are targeting the rule of 40 as a yardstick to show progress for the ACI On Demand business. In other words, our revenue growth rate and an EBITDA margin that when added together equates to 40% or better. At maturity, our goal for ACI On Demand business is to achieve a 40% EBITDA margin with mid to high single-digit revenue growth. Our quarter one EBITDA margin improvements were the result of many factors. We’re in the last stages of managing out inefficient revenues. In addition, the completion of our multi-year data center integration included a core focus on improving nonfunctional requirements, such as availability, scalability, capacity and security, has been rewarded by positive revenue growth and an improved customer experience. While there is still plenty of work to be done to attain our revenue and margin targets, progress to date affirms our 2019, 2020 projections. On the renewals side, within our ACI On Premise P&L, we continue our 100% adoption rate for customers renewing in the UP Retail Payments Solution program, or RPS, which bridges customers to our powerful UP technology. RPS continues to drive 25% to 30% total contract value uplift for renewals. We’re taking a similar renewal approach with UP Real-Time Payments Solution launched in quarter four. RTPS allows organizations to address their real-time gross settlement, SWIFT messaging and real-time payment needs with a single universal offering. I’ll now turn to our UP Solution portfolios and underlying R&D initiatives. In Q1, we announced that UP Merchant Payments is now available on the cloud. Based on a multi-tenant architecture, UP Merchant Payments offers the scalability required to meet the channel growth needs of merchants now and into the future. Also, in quarter one, we announced that a suite of processing on fraud monitoring capabilities within UP Retail Payments will support UBI – UPI’s transactions, that’s UnionPay International’s transactions in India. Through our decade-long R&D build, we have now delivered Linux support to five of our six solutions. This initiative reduces the switching and delivery cost for our customers by 75% to 90% per transaction through the massive hardware and middleware savings on running UP with Linux. With this same customer-centric strategy in mind, we are building support for the host versus SQL, a lower-cost, open and modern database option. Pilot projects begin this year with commercial delivery in 2019. Following the quarter four release, the Universal Online Banker, our cloud-based, multi-tenant digital banking solution, we kicked off two customer upgrades and one new customer project in quarter one. Our pipeline for UOB has more than doubled as numerous banks are evaluating ACI to transform their digital engagement strategies. I also want to spotlight continuous advancements in Titanium, our payment intelligence and analytics initiative. Early in quarter one, we completed the deployment of our next-generation streaming analytics engine to all of our fraud customers. These advancements are driving 30% faster performance, higher acceptance rate and lower false positives. We also continue to actively deploy and develop new payment endpoints supporting our any payment, every possibility commitment to the marketplace. I believe that payment providers with connections to the most endpoints and services will win and ACI’s capabilities in this area are unparalleled. ACI uniquely makes fast, simple and secure payments possible around the world by connecting more ways to pay with more payment capabilities than any other provider. Our UP Solutions continue to receive industry accolades. In quarter one, Frost & Sullivan presented ACI with the 2017 European Competitive Strategy Innovation and Leadership Award in the payment systems market. In addition, we received two industry awards for our fraud solution. ACI was named Fraud Innovation Firm of the Year by Finance Monthly and Merchant Payment Ecosystem awarded ACI as the Best ID, Security and Antifraud Solution of the Year. I will now share some of our more significant contracts signed in quarter one. These examples span the globe and a representative of strategic payment opportunities we’re seeing across our four core customer segments. I’ll begin with the Merchant segment with key wins in transportation. We signed a significant contract with one of the world’s largest transportation companies to provide a centralized omni-channel payment platform. With ACI’s UP Merchant Payments Solutions, this France-based railway will be able to move away from a proprietary payment system that is expensive to maintain and enhance. ACI’s support of the nexo standard was the key factor in this win. In another European transportation win, one of the world’s largest travel service providers to the online travel agency selected UP eCommerce payments to provide payment and fraud protection services. We also signed a deal with ATF, a leading national provider of smart transportation solutions that processes more than 50 million photo enforced traffic violations and toll transactions every year. ACI will simplify a complex process of multi-payment touch points. We also gained traction in other merchant subsections – segments, including e-commerce retailers and restaurants. One of the world’s leading sports retailers, already a customer of our UP eCommerce Payment solution selected ACI as its global payments layer to provide flexibility and choice through one integrated solution. In addition, one of the world’s top restaurant brands expanded its relationship with ACI. Our UP Merchant Payments Solution was selected to provide this global brand with data security through point-to-point encryption and tokenization for card-present and card-not-present transactions. Turning now to our bank and financial intermediary segments, we signed a strategic contract with UnionPay International, a leading China-based bank, card company with the world’s largest cardholder base of more than 7 billion cards. UnionPay International is set to grow it’s worldwide footprint significantly by enabling Chinese tourist cardholders to connect to ACI’s extensive global network of payment endpoints. We also signed a contract with OTP Bank Group, one of the largest independent financial service providers in Central and Eastern Europe. Already using UP Retail Payments and UP Payments Risk Management, OTP will now implement ACI’s API manager capabilities and UP Real-Time Payments to power its open banking digital transformation initiative. We also signed UP Retail Payments contract with a major UK bank. ACI was selected to update the bank’s instant payment gateway for UK Faster Payments, as well as create a platform for its global instant payments initiative. Real-time payment momentum is also building in Asia. Following ACI’s selection in quarter four by PayNet to build Malaysia’s real-time retail payment platform, we started signing gateway connector contracts in quarter one. I’ll also highlight one additional customer in the segment, a significant RPS renewal with one of the largest banks in the Nordics. This bank is leveraging RPS to transform its consumer payments business within a country that is well advanced on its journey to become a cashless society. In the Corporate segment, UP Bill Payment was selected to transform the consumer payment experience for several U.S. organizations, including two large insurance companies and one large mortgage provider that services more than 450,000 loans. These organizations chose ACI in order to provide their customer with a wide range of payment service options, customized bill presentation and ensure PCI compliance. In summary, ACI is off to a strong start to 2018 with momentum across our two P&Ls, six solution areas and four customer segments. Our journey of investment in R&D infrastructure had been rewarded with excellent bookings, particularly new bookings. That places us in a strong position to achieve our full-year guidance targets in the fast-evolving electronic payments industry. A sage once told me that nothing worthwhile is easy. During the last few years, we certainly stared in the face of nothing as easy. Portion of that quote, it will be good to cash in on the worthwhile portion through the coming years. With that, I’ll pass the baton to Scott to provide his financial commentary.
Scott Behrens: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of the first quarter and then provide an update on our outlook for 2018. We’ll then open the line for questions. I’ll be starting my comments on Slide 6 with key takeaways from the quarter. And just as a reminder, effective January 1, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, which replaces ASC 605. And as previously disclosed, we’ve adopted the modified retrospective approach and will present our key financial results on both new and the old basis for all of 2018. And for all my prepared comments today, I’ll be discussing our results on a constant GAAP basis. So overall, Q1 was a solid start to the year for us. We had $215 million in new bookings in the first quarter, which is more than double what we booked in Q1 last year and is actually our highest first quarter ever of new bookings. These strong bookings drove a notable increase in our backlog with both our 12-month and 60-month backlog seeing strong growth. Q1 revenue was $225 million, which was above the guidance range we provided in the last quarter with our On Demand business growing 6% over Q1 of last year, offset by lower revenue in our On Premise business. The decline in the On Premise business was due to timing and size of renewal and capacity events in 2018 compared to Q1 2017. Total EBITDA was lower in the quarter compared to the prior year from our On Premise business as a result of the timing of those high-margin license fees that we get on renewal. We expect 2018 to follow a more historic pattern of quarterly phasing of renewal events. Our On Demand business delivered strong growth in EBITDA with net EBITDA margins increasing over 800 basis points, driven by a combination of both revenue growth and lower expenses compared to the same period in 2017. We continue to be very optimistic about future margin improvement opportunities in our On Demand business. We ended the first quarter with $74 million in cash on hand, up from $70 million at the end of 2017, and a debt balance of $689 million, down $7 million from the end of 2017. Our adjusted operating free cash flow for the quarter was $36 million, down from $76 million in Q1 2017, and again, due primarily from the timing and size of renewal and capacity events compared to the same time in Q1 2017. Also of note, during the quarter, S&P Global Ratings raised it’s corporate credit rating on us to a BB from a BB-. And lastly, we have a $200 million remaining on our share buyback authorization. Turning next to Slide 7 with our full-year outlook. With our solid start to the year and in our particular, our strong bookings, we are reiterating our full-year guidance. So starting with our guidance under historical accounting ASC 605, we continue to expect revenue to be in a range of $1.05 billion to $1.075 billion, which represents 3% to 5% growth over 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $270 million to $285 million, which excludes approximately $7 million in significant transaction-related expenses. And we expect to generate between $240 million and $250 million of revenue in the second quarter. Under the new – excuse me, under the new accounting standard, ASC 606, we continue to expect revenue in 2018 to be in a range of $1.03 billion to $1.055 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $255 million to $270 million. And we expect to generate between $230 million and $240 million of revenue in the second quarter. And as a reminder, these accounting changes do not impact our new bookings, which we continue to expect to grow in the low double digits for the full-year 2018, and also our free cash flow is not impacted by the new accounting guidance. We continue to expect our free cash flow to be in a range of $140 million to $155 million for the full-year. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.
Blake Anderson: Hi, this is Blake on for Brett. Thanks for taking my question. Nice to see the bookings growth. How much of the net new bookings growth, that acceleration, how much of that was maybe just catching up from the fourth quarter that got pushed out versus just a really strong 1Q?
Scott Behrens: Well, I think, I mean, obviously, at the fourth quarter earnings call, we’ve said we had deals slipped into the new year, had started off strong. I wouldn’t necessarily split our Q1 bookings out between what should be in 2017 and what should be in 2018. But obviously, I think what it shows is that deals were not lost. They were just lost at the time. And so, as I said in my prepared remarks, it’s a record first quarter for us. Obviously, some of that stuff, we wish we would have signed last year. But I think the point of starting off strong is, it doesn’t throw us off track from being able to convert those bookings to revenue this year, regardless of whether they would have been signed at the end of last year or early part of this year.
Philip Heasley: The fact that we had the GAs coming at the end of last year, the new Linux offerings and whatnot, it doesn’t surprise me that there was a bit of a hiatus in terms of the signings. But what we said was that we had a really – our – in our prepared comments, what we said was that, we had a very strong quarter and we had a – we’re very pleased with the growth in the pipeline. And that’s probably the best way of answering the question.
Blake Anderson: Great. And then how much of the really strong – the net new bookings, how much of those were BASE24 UP-driven? And we are asking, because last quarter, you noted you had a big bank UP deal you signed, but did not see that on bookings yet. Is that – did that come into the 1Q bookings and then just overall BASE24 UP-driven?
Scott Behrens: I wouldn’t – I think, we had strong bookings. As Phil said in his script, it really went through each of our solutions. We had strong bookings across all of our categories. I mean, we had a large UP renewal in the quarter. But I wouldn’t say that the UP new bookings was disproportionate to the other solutions. And we really had broad-based bookings growth across all of our six solutions.
Blake Anderson: Great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Hey, good morning. It seems like you’re seeing a wider range of merchants – or in that category of merchants with, I think, this is your second large deal with either a transportation or a logistics company. Can you talk about the main drivers there? And does this expand the potential TAM from what you might had been thinking about a couple of years ago?
Philip Heasley: Yes. Our real specialty is electronic payments. So if you really think about it, there are becoming more and more ways that things can be paid for before you get to the point of purchase. One of our pizza companies now does over 90% of their – of payment settlement at the point of ordering, right? And that’s kind of a good example of the way the world is going. Transportation, we actually – I actually rattled off three major transportation logistics players as signing in the quarter. And every one of them wants their main experience to be basically a card-not-present experience and that they will facilitate someone who shows up with a card. But if you think about it, if you’re going to the train or the movie theater or your car is driving from one lane to another lane, what you want is you want a real-time experience. You want a real-time experience in terms of that taking place. And it’s not only hands off, but it’s mind off what’s actually taking place. And we’ve seen that with our big gaming company partners in terms of kids are on their Game Boy or whatever they’re called and whatnot, and they need to make an immediate purchase, they need a real-time. So our offerings, I would tell you that in our six solution sets of merchants and corporates, it’s hard to differentiate sometimes between corporate and a merchant. But they – I would say that they’re actually moving faster towards real payments than the banks are trying to hold on to their traditional higher-margin pieces and whatnot. And you’re seeing certainly transportation, gaming, food merchants and whatnot thing, fine. We’ll drive the payment decisions and whatnot. And that’s where an awful lot of our signings are coming from, be it transportation, gaming, restaurants or multi-global players that really have to think about the world as the – as their potential customer base and whatnot. So we’re seeing very strong growth there.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, can you talk a little bit about on the FinTech disruptor side, some of the new payment providers, some of the online payment providers and maybe digital wallets, can you talk about how you’re playing there either supplying technology or how maybe some of those new entrants may have changed the economic about how some of your customers think about in-house versus outsource?
Philip Heasley: Well, one of our fastest-growing businesses is – one of our fastest-growing offerings is our ability to offer a gateway to anybody who wants that gateway to a multitude of payments. And I’m talking about probably we’re somewhere between 500 and 1,000 choices that someone could come and sign up with us for. I was kind of laughing, because we even allow people to get to bitcoin, right? And of course, we get paid the same little tiny bit as this was approaching anything else. So listening to what one of our competitors was talking about, we’re probably bigger in that business than they are, but we don’t pretend to be in the business. So don’t miss okay. But we give you the ability, that’s why UnionPay International wants connectivity to us and whatnot, as they want the ability to be able to touch virtually hundreds of different endpoints. And we provide them the ability to reach out to that payment type and satisfy their – what they need to accomplish. That’s a very – that is either the fastest or second-fastest category of business that we’re selling right now. It’s one of the smaller at this point, but it’s growing very, very quickly.
Peter Heckmann: Great. And then just a last question and I’ll get back in the queue. But Scott, you had given multi-year EBITDA guidance ranges last quarter. I thought that market responded very positively to that. Can you just at this point confirm or talk about any changes in those longer-term forecast?
Scott Behrens: Yes. Well, there has been no changes. Obviously, we’re tracking on the full-year 2018, and that’s really the baseline. I think a lot of the profitability improvements that we’re starting to see in our AOD business, those are going to be the ones in part to drive that growth in those outer years. So I think, we’re tracking nicely to executing on those long-term outlooks.
Peter Heckmann: Great. Good to hear. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Mr. George, your line is open/
George Sutton: Yes, thank you. I love how you say my name. So relative to strong bookings that you mentioned you felt were in front of you for 2018, Phil, I wanted to get a little bit more of a sense of what you’re seeing in the pipeline. And I do want to make sure that this is the case, but I don’t believe your guidance includes any elephant. So, obviously, there are some opportunities for significant bookings growth this year?
Philip Heasley: Yes. Well, the good news on the elephants is that, we’re now on to Page 2 of potential elephants versus – working one page. But no, we can’t. We made the mistake in the past of thinking we could time these really large deals. Quite honestly, if three or four of these deals came and said they wanted to sign next quarter, we’d be in a world of hurt to be able to actually do – to do them all. But those dialogues are progressing very, very well. And we’re now at the point that we’re thinking – we’re making sure that our strategy and our strategic options align to which ones make – not only make the most sense for our potential partners, but which make the most sense for our longer-term planning.
George Sutton: Just to be clear, you’re saying your implementation capabilities would be stretched?
Philip Heasley: That’s correct, right.
George Sutton: So one other thing you said I found very interesting is 100% of your On Premise customers have adopted RPS, which, if I think about what that means, you’re basically saying you’re seeing zero churn in that part of the business. Is that effective…
Philip Heasley: Our attrition, I think, we’ve said this many times over. I mean, if any conventional way of rounding attrition would have to be the zero in terms of our RPS business. And what we’ve said is that, we’re running a 100% on renewals. We haven’t – we still have about 2.5 years of…
Scott Behrens: Yes.
Philip Heasley: Almost three years of renewals left. But we’ve got a good portion of our largest customers have renewed. And so what this says is that, they’re bridging both technologies and we – we’re continuing to grow on the projects in terms of them figuring out what they attack first or what new opportunity they use first. But no, that continues both at 100% and we’re still getting the 25% to 30% total contract value uplift for those transfers, which basically equates to 5% a year growth, right, on a 5-year contract.
George Sutton: All right. That’s it for me. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Eller from Wells Fargo.
David Eller: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Scott, you mentioned that you expected 2018 to have a more similar phasing in terms of renewal that’s in terms of historicals. But in terms of the EBITDA, it looks like Q1 EBITDA looks like it’s probably a smaller proportion of your kind of the midpoint of your guidance? Could you just talk about either the timing or phasing of maybe when you might expect EBITDA earnings to hit this year compared to historical?
Scott Behrens: Yes. Really, the – yes, I mean, the whole timing there, the license fee on renewal in the On Premise business is all at 100% margin. And so it’s – that has an impact on the On Premise license fees, 100% of that is EBITDA and 100% of it is cash. And so it’s really following the timing of the renewal book this year. And so when that – when those deals renew in the later quarters and it’s typically been a second-half phenomenon, it – that – so too will the margin and cash that comes with that. So it’s really just the timing of the renewal book.
David Eller: Okay. So when I look at you reiterating your guidance on sales and EBITDA for the year, I guess, what I’m saying is, will EBITDA be much more weighted to not only the back-half of the Q4 of this year than historical periods?
Scott Behrens: I would say second-half Q3 and Q4. That’s typically where we start seeing a lot of the renewal activity. I mean, again, it’s – this year, in particular, I mean, every year has a different timing of the book, but most of it’s – most of it happens in the second-half.
David Eller: Gotcha. And then Phil, you say that the – or you mentioned in the script that you were kind of managing through the last stages of inefficient revenues. Could you talk about what ballpark – what inning you’re in and maybe when you expect that to phase out?
Philip Heasley: I think we’re in the very late innings of it. Couple of three years ago, it – when we were getting rid of payday lenders and subprime, we were expunging our books of those things that are regulated – no, when we are a regulated entity like our banks are, right? When we’re getting rid of that stuff and we’re burning our way through the, I call it, S1 false promises, we have virtually ate up all our growth and looked like we weren’t growing. Now it’s still a – it’s still an offset to our growth and it’s a couple – it’s maybe 1% or 2%. But it’s not like it was – it wasn’t like it was before. So this year, next, we really see it – we’re at the very – maybe, Scott, you should talk to…
Scott Behrens: No, I think….
Philip Heasley: …so I think we’re at the very end of the integration – sane integrated – we could have kept some of these businesses that, we have revenue growth, but no EBITDA. And I guess, we’re just too old fashioned. We’d rather not have – we know you’d pay us more for the revenue growth than the EBITDA. But we just don’t see the logic on just keeping businesses for revenue growth that don’t produce value.
Scott Behrens: Yes. I think, the only thing I’d add to that is, yes, we’ve been managing some attrition from acquired portfolios probably the last four, five years. And we’re – we – so it has been a headwind to our top line growth. We’re probably down to maybe 1% a year in terms of our – it’s still a top line headwind. But yes, we’re probably down to about 1% of revenue a year.
David Eller: Okay. And then Scott, lastly for me. Your bonds are going to be callable at part in August. And I hope you could provide maybe some color on whether you expect to address those in the near future?
Scott Behrens: I mean, obviously, we’re aware that the call premium expires here in August, and we’re obviously exploring what our next steps are. But nothing to announce at this point.
David Eller: All right. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
John Kraft: Well, thanks, everybody, for dialing in. We look forward to catching up in the coming weeks.
Operator: And this concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.";[0.09945819193684602, 0.09235121924489942];0.09235121924489942;0.09945819193684602;1
5;ACIW;2018-08-04;"Operator: Good day. My name is Karnesia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Reports Q2 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please limit your question to one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Kraft. Sir, you may begin.
John Kraft: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Today’s call, like all of our events, is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our Web site as well as with the SEC. On this morning’s call is Phil Heasley, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Phil.
Philip Heasley: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I’ll spend the next few minutes providing deeper insight into Q2. I’ll focus my comments on customer and market trends by sharing key customer wins that highlight our global traction. I will then turn the call over to Scott for the financial review. So, jumping right in, ACI’s fiscal year is on track. Q2 revenues were in line with guidance and above street consensus. We saw continued strong demand for our UP solutions across all four of our targeted segments of banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporations. Around the globe, we signed marquee new contracts as well as renewed strategic relationships. Our implementation book continues to grow. Propelled by a strong first half and robust pipeline, we remain confident in achieving our full year guidance. New bookings in the first half of the year were up 52% over the first half of 2017. Demand for multitenant platform solutions in our ACI On Demand business contributed significantly to this growth. In our ACI On Premise P&L, we continued our 100% adoption rate for customers renewing into the UP Retail Payments Solutions, or RPS, which bridges customers to our powerful UP technology. Additionally, we saw increased demand for real-time payments. In Q2, we signed 14 immediate payment contracts in Southeast Asia, where banks are moving quickly to real-time. I will now share some of the significant contracts signed in Q2. These examples span the globe and are also representative of types of strategic payment opportunities in the second half of 2018 pipeline and across our four customer segments. I’ll start with the merchant segment, which continues to see increased global adoption of cloud-based omni-channel solutions. Merchants are driven to meet customer expectations for anytime, anywhere, any channel payments. Included in the key wins are one of the 10 largest grocery retailers in the U.S., which has more than 350 stores, and which processes 500 million transactions annually. Selected UP Merchant Payments for a leading global health and wellness company is leveraging up eCommerce payments for their gateway and fraud reduction services. They wanted to integrate their current acquired solutions and add additional payments internationally as well as add their U.S. business. At the same time, they acquired ACI’s world-class tools to combat significant customer fraud taking place in Europe. A leading French-based international retail group selected ACI as the strategic partner for all their payments. We are replacing the concentration routing to acquirers and the token part of their business. The largest travel conglomerate in China, representing 22 airline companies, 440 hotels and several online travel agencies, has selected UP eCommerce payments to consolidate all its payment activities together to provide a personalized travel and seamless payment experience for their customers. Moving to the corporate segment, we’re seeing a growing trend among corporates that are increasingly planning to move more of their bill payment infrastructure to the cloud. A study from an independent research firm highlights that 70% of corporations plan to move there bill payments to the cloud. A key trend, which is driving increased interest in ACI’s UP Bill Payment solutions. Key wins include; one of the largest privately held finance companies in the U.S. selected UP Bill Payment solutions to facilitate customer loan payments, as well as continued support of its expansion. A leading U.S.-based software company that provides over a dozen Web and mobile applications for tax filing and related fraud functions is migrating all its divisions to the UP Bill Payment solutions. In the bank and finance intermediaries segments, we closed several major international contracts. Rabobank, a large European bank has selected ACI issuer to modernize the management of its card portfolio business. The solution will allow Rabobank to quickly issue new payment products, including all card types as well as new tokenized payment products. We also signed a contract with JCB, a leader in Japanese payment market, representing 111 million card members and accepted by 30 million merchants. As JCB expands its footprint, UP Merchant Payments will be one of its alternative connection methods to profit its online payments. One of the largest banks in South Africa with significant operations across the continent selected UP Retail Payments to innovate new payment solutions. Its growth in the merchant space was also a key driver of its selection of RPS. A large bank in Southeast Europe has selected UP Retail Payments to address its growing card transaction volumes. One of Canada’s top five banks has adopted a cloud-first strategy with its initial focus on corporate expansion. Its global financial crime management group is utilizing UP Payments Risk Manager for fraud detection in Canada initially and then replacing the other regions, including the Caribbean, Central and South America. East West Bank, a large West Coast bank that operates across 139 locations with a focus on U.S. and greater China selected ACI’s new award-winning Universal Online Banker. The digital marketing solution provides the bank with new UI, open API’s and multi-language functionality, which is key to its growth plans in China and Hong Kong. Looking forward, we continue to be very optimistic about second half of 2018. The major trends I just shared are driving key deals from the second half pipeline. In addition, the impact of open banking and PSD2 continue to be a key driver, particularly in Australia and throughout the European continent. ACI is uniquely positioned to help these customers. And lastly, our customers continue to be very interested in Linux due to the lower total cost of ownership enabled by Linux-based infrastructure. A leading independent professional service company just completed a new evaluation of UP BASE24-eps on Linux. This soon-to-be published report demonstrates that large banks would be able to process 1 billion transactions per month for a significantly lower total cost of ownership, up to 90% improvement. The study also validated that the Linux platform could easily handle the mission critical payment processing needs of very large banks with high-availability, scalability and high-transaction throughput. Further, the evaluation highlighted that the cost savings of deploying Linux could be done in the public cloud. We see this report as significant and we expect Linux to be a key driver of future pipeline growth. In summary, we continue to see momentum across all facets of our business. Our strong first half results position us well going into the second half of 2018. Our healthy pipeline and alignment with key industry trends around the globe puts us in a strong position to achieve our full year guidance targets. To reiterate, I am comfortable and personally excited and optimistic about the second half of the year based on the momentum outlined above. With that, I’ll hand it over to Scott to provide financial commentary. Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of the second quarter and then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of 2018. We’ll then open the line for questions. I’ll be starting my comments on Slide 6 with key takeaways from the quarter. Just as a reminder, effective January 1, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, which replaces ASC 605. As previously disclosed, we’ll present our key financial results on both the new and old basis for all of 2018. For all my prepared comments, I’ll be discussing our results on a constant GAAP basis. So Q2 was another solid quarter for us with Q2 new bookings of a 127 million, which brings us to year-to-date growth at 52% versus this time last year and we remain on-track to achieve our full year new bookings expectations. Our 12-month backlog grew 5 million, while our 60-month backlog declined 17 million with both figures adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations during the quarter. Q2 revenue was 241 million and within the guidance range we provided in the last quarter. And as a reminder, we expect 2018 to follow a more historical pattern of quarterly phasing of renewal events, which will provide more of our high-margin license fees revenues into the second half of this year. And for those of you modeling out of the new revenue recognition of rule ASC 606, as we get into the second half of this year, the new accounting rules become an optical tailwind versus the headwind we saw in the first half. In the second quarter, we generated 26 million in cash flows from operations or double the 13 million in Q2 last year. We ended the quarter with 59 million in cash and a debt balance of 687 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.3 million shares for $54 million or an average price of $23.21. And lastly, we have 177 million remaining on our share buyback authorization. Turning next to Slide 7 with our full year outlook. As Phil said, based on our progress for the first half of the year and our optimism about the second half, we are reiterating our 2018 guidance and are generally comfortable with how the consensus estimates are lining up for Q3 and Q4. And also based on our expected revenue profile and cost structure as we exit 2018, we are comfortable reaffirming our longer range outlook for 2019 and 2020 EBITDA. So for the full year 2018 under historical accounting ASC 605, we continue to expect revenue to be in a range of 1.05 billion to 1.075 billion, which represents 3% to 5% growth over 2017 on a comparable GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of 270 million to 285 million, which excludes approximately 7 million of significant transaction-related expenses. We expect to generate between 235 million and 245 million of revenue in the third quarter. Under the new accounting standard, ASC 606, we continue to expect revenue in 2018 to be between 1.03 billion and 1.055 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of 255 million to 270 million, which again excludes 7 million of significant transaction-related expenses. And we expect to generate between 230 million and 240 million of revenue in the third quarter. And as a reminder, the new revenue recognition rule do not impact our bookings, which we continue to expect new bookings to grow in the low double digits for the full year 2018. Additionally, our free cash flow is not impacted by the new accounting guidance and we continue to expect our free cash flow to be in a range of 140 million to 155 million for the full year. So that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your question comes from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum.
George Sutton: Good morning, guys. Phil, you’re obviously enthusiastic about the second half driven by a pipeline that you see. Obviously we don’t see that detail. Could you just frame that enthusiasm and opportunity for us?
Philip Heasley: Well, I’m comfortable with the second half for several reasons. One is we did what we said we were going to do in the second quarter. And our whole year is more like most businesses’ quarter because the shape of our delivery is an annual delivery; it’s not a quarterly delivery. So it’s hard for us in any given quarter to be overly enthusiastic by variances that are just driven by timing, by the annual sign up in that year. We’re just really confident. Most of our – we’ve made our revenue numbers this part of the year mostly by over performance in the On Demand side of the business and we’re still waiting for the annual renewals that we know are going to take place and they’re going to take place further on in the year. So a lot of our – all this good news in bookings is coming from new names and new logos and new businesses, not so much associated with the renewals that are going to come in the second part of the year. And this strange new way we’re going to look at revenue under 606, renewals are much more valued or they’re almost over valued in the 606 accounting. So the fact that we are where we are from both the 605 and 606 standpoint, we’re very comfortable. The bookings are coming in very strong and the amount of usage, now we’re a little bit different than other companies, a lot of other companies is that we book and then we implement and then we grow revenue. So one of the reasons we feel confident is that the implementation book continues to grow and we can only implement as fast as we can convert or build for our customers and as fast as they can ramp. So at this point, our revenue is an important driver of EBITDA whereas our expenses are very much constant as they work their way through the year. So yes, there’s no reason not to be very – there’s no reason not to be confident, especially since year-to-date has been largely driven by over performance on the On Demand side of the business.
George Sutton: Perfect. Just one other thing. A recent trade rag named real-time payments as the number one sort of major initiative in the FinTech world. You’re obviously a direct beneficiary and you mentioned 14 new contracts this quarter. Could you just give us a sense of how significant this opportunity should be for you?
Philip Heasley: Well, I don’t want to get into the forecasting how quickly adoption rates are going. If you look at countries like India, India is forecasting 1 billion transactions a day on their new – it would be the equivalent of [indiscernible] and whatnot. You have to believe in the ramp statistics in terms of getting there and whatnot, because there’s a fraction of those numbers. But I believe particularly Asia, Southwest to Southeast Asia, they are going to bypass the heavy concentration of transactions coming through the credit side and then maturing into the debit side. It’s going to be more on the debit – they’re going to go directly to the debit side of the equation. So we view – I think we view two trends. On average, we are in less than one-seventh $0.01 for transactions in terms of what we do. But we do many, many more – we do more transactions than Visa or MasterCard who tend to earn – tend to process a transaction for what they do, right? We see our volumes coming in very strongly in the next two or three years and we see the revenues, it’s kind of a CAGR gain, because we’re not going to see as big a pop as it moves up the S curve. But as it moves up, we think those numbers – put another way, we think – well, if you look at the German profile and with its low penetration of credit and its high number of transactions per individual, we think Asia is going to look like – and I’m not talking about Japan and we’re really not talking about mainly in China yet, but they’re really not open markets for the rest of – but we’re talking about the rest of Southeast and Southwest Asia. And we think the transaction – we think there’s easily a driver of – driving that 1.1 trillion, 1.2 trillion transactions a year where it’s doubled in the next five years. And we’re going to get our requisite share as long as we keep signing up the people that are adopting it. It’s not a get-rich-quick scheme, because we’re not going to get the volume day one, month one, year one, but we’re going to get the opportunity for the volume.
George Sutton: Perfect. Thank you, Phil. I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question is from David Eller with Wells Fargo.
David Eller: Good morning and thanks for taking the call. Phil, you called out Australia and Europe as being particularly strong in the quarter and your outlook. Could you also maybe touch on the U.S. and North America and what you’re seeing here?
Philip Heasley: I think most of – we’re doing very well on the renewal side of the business. We’re running at a 100%. People are embracing the new technology. We are the migration path. I think most of our opportunity in terms of big growth opportunity is more in front of us versus renewal opportunity, which is right on us. And the reason I say that is that it doesn’t look – we’re beginning to see the non-renewal customers. We’re beginning to see a lot of new business from FinTech and other type players that are seeing a very different cost of entry, right, especially in the Linux environment and whatnot. And we’re – the banks are still concentrated on profitability and showing you guys their revenue growth every quarter. We’re not seeing the heavy non-regulatory investment. We see dialogue on it and the Canadian banks are certainly, I would say investment is stronger in the Canadian banks than it is in the U.S. and of course at least one of those bridges both countries and whatnot, but we think most of our opportunity is in front of us on the financial segment. On merchants and corporates, Europe is moving much quicker from a merchant standpoint than the U.S. is, but we’re getting some – we’re getting a lot of e-tailing from the U.S. and a lot of interest in pure multi-channels from the start, kinds of players. So that’s very positive. And our financial intermediary business in the U.S. is doing very well, mostly based on incremental volume that they are acquiring and pushing through us.
David Eller: Great. And then, Scott, on the – you kind of reiterated your 2019 and 2020 goals. I think for 2019 EBITDA, your range was like 300 to 315. That midpoint would be like 17% growth for next year and I think consensus is looking for 4% to 5% revenue growth. So can you help us maybe understand some of your assumptions around margin improvement for 2019 and maybe 2020 as well?
Scott Behrens: I think that there’s really I would say two drivers and a lot of its driven by our path to – our rule of 40 that we talked about in our AOD business. Really it’s based on the profile of combinations of two things. Its revenue growth on top of that cost structure but also lower costs as we exit 2018. We’ve talked in the past about a lot of the heavy investments we’ve made in building out that infrastructure, whether it’s physical, virtual, cyber-security. And so it’s really a combination of both, higher revenue as well as lower-cost as we exit 2018.
David Eller: Great. And then last call for me, I know your bond call price drops to par in August. Can you maybe talk about your thoughts around your capital structure? And then if you could remind us maybe your target leverage and what considerations go into that leverage target?
Scott Behrens: Well, I think we’ve historically said that we’re kind of comfortable around, call it that 2.5x. And if you look historically when we’ve done acquisitions, we’ve sort of – you’d see a step up in leverage. It is part of the acquisition, but then we quickly delever from there. So we’re comfortable with 2.5. We’re also comfortable with the right cash flow structure, we would acquire something that we’d be able to – on a combination be able to bring that down. In terms of our bonds, yes, we’re aware that we’re coming up on the five year and the expiration of these call premium. The market conditions are certainly favorable for us to get in and refinance those. So we’re keeping an eye on that.
David Eller: All right. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Your next question is from Peter Heckmann with Davidson.
Alexis Huseby: Hi, guys. This is Alexis on for Pete today. So first, I’m just hoping you can comment a little more on the year-to-date eCommerce wins within the merchant space and specifically some of the factors that are helping drive merchants to decide to take some of this payment capability in-house?
Philip Heasley: Well, I really think there is two behaviors going on in the e-retailers. I think you have one set of customers who say, my top five priorities are A through E and payments is not one of them. And they’re more than likely to go to a full solution provider like Avion or Global Payments or Paymentech and say listen, we’re not doing it as the top of the – top five priority and whatnot. Then you have other ones who deal – they have good global volume around the world. They’re thinking about it from a global standpoint. They’ve got to figure out how to do global logistics execution from a delivery standpoint. So the whole concept of managing an integrated step of [ph] logistics and managing the cash, there is a huge – there’s huge benefit for them to leverage that capability and be able to drive yield and liquidity from it. And we tend to do very well with those companies. The other ones that are a driving factor which is kind of a new one, but it’s a very nice one. We’re seeing a lot of M&A funds that are beginning to concentrate in categories and also by five different fast-food companies and whatnot. And they’ll want to put in as many payment capabilities as possible of the one modernized – they’ve been kind of in jail with their pedant merchant providers and whatnot. And so instead of owned company by owned company, these guys are managing the efficiency of that across their portfolio of businesses that you’ll end up working, one day you’re doing hamburgers and the next day you’re doing tacos or whatever in turns, but it lands up being a leverageable payment system for them. And that’s been a very nice arena of business. A lot of those are – we have several of those in the implementation phase. And then another form is we’re doing very well in transportation. And you say, well, transportation is really not an e-retailer, they are really – they’re very much physical. But the truth of the matter is, 99% of people want ticket in hand and the transportation company wants ticket in hands and kiosk is initially in concept, but kiosk is kind of the point of the last resort. So omni-channel there works very well and it’s very leverageable. And a lot of those guys who are willing to work with each other because the American railroad system or the French railroad system are not in competition with each other, they are kind of in the – they’re kind of categorized together and whatnot. So those are the ones that I would – I think we told you last time about camera-based traffic observation. It’s really clear that the lower the average ticket, right. And the other one is gaining for us, right. The lower the average ticket, you really can’t afford. If you have a $10 average ticket and a $8 average ticket, you’re not going to – you don’t want to pay $0.40 say or $1 a transaction, right, on that and you’ve got to make your forward decision very quickly, you’ve got to make your payment decision very quickly and you can’t – you’ve got to really go for a least cost routing in terms of doing it. So we’re just filling natural niches. And there are other companies in which you could argue that it isn’t in their top five priorities right now, but we’re filling a natural set of niches that eCommerce is creating by changes in behavior – how we behave differently. Domino’s, 95% of people pay for the pizza at the time they order it whether they pick it up or they don’t pick it up or whatever. So it’s following behavior and the objectives of the company is in terms of executing those behaviors.
Alexis Huseby: Great. Thank you. That’s really helpful detail. And then would you be able to break down bookings over the last year on more of a dollar weighted basis by some of your focus areas of BASE24, biller direct, online banking and also by geography?
Scott Behrens: Yes, if off the top of my head, probably not. But I think a lot of the sales – as Phil said, a lot of the growth is coming from new names, new logos, predominantly at least in the first half more so in our On Demand business than in the On Prem business. So I would say at least in the first half, the growth – bookings growth has been pretty heavily weighted towards the On Demand side.
Alexis Huseby: Okay. Thank you. That’s helpful. And that’s all I have.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.
Blake Anderson: Good morning. This is Blake on for Brett. Thanks for taking my questions. You had a nice license quarter despite the 606 headwind you’ve talked about. The growth was fairly high sequentially at least. Was this within your expectations on the license line or was there maybe any pull forward from the second half?
Scott Behrens: No, that’s what I was saying. This year it’s going to be more – kind of follow more of that historical pattern where a lot of the renewal activities sits in the second half of the year. So I’d say, yes, the first half is in line, first half second quarter in line from our renewal book perspective. And just the timing of renewals are more back half weighted this year. So that’s why I said on the call that we get normal skewed optics in our favor in the second half. 606 also turned in our favor, but just the timing of the renewal book this year versus 2017 is more favorable to Q3 and Q4.
Philip Heasley: I was actually saying as I thought we did very well in revenues, 605 and 606 in light of the fact that we have – year-to-year, we have a lighter renewal. And I think you know our objective in terms of – is going 100% to migrate them to the new technology. Until we want that, we’re still shooting for that 25%, 28%, 30% TCV and that usually requires us to renew on renewal, right. You’re not going to early renew those situations. So this year, the second half is a heavier renewal than last year’s same period.
Blake Anderson: And then on the AOD segment, the bookings were good there what you talked about. The revenue growth in the quarter, looks like that ticked down from about 6% in the first quarter to about flat in the 2Q. Were there any headwinds in there you would call out such as may be bill pay? I know that’s a larger piece of it? And then should we expect mid-single digit growth to return there in the second half?
Scott Behrens: Yes, I would – there’s probably two things on the AOD business. Number one is, there can be timing differences between calls at the end of Q1 and early part of 2Q in terms of our government protocol and in terms of cash payments. So I would look at – there is a certain seasonality element in the AOD business. But the preponderance of our growth is probably going to come in the holiday period with our merchants and you’ll see that in Q4. There is a seasonality in the business.
Blake Anderson: Got it. And then just lastly on free cash flow, I know you said it was up year-over-year. You reiterated guidance. It was a little low relative to our industry expectations. Were there any one-timers you would call out?
Scott Behrens: No, nothing in particular. We were up double last year and again, reiterating our full year. So we came in from a cash perspective where we thought we might not. Again, I think – part of that is also again the timing of renewals because the key not only is the revenue and margin, but it’s cash. And so we’ll see more of that in the second half.
Blake Anderson: Got it. Thank you very much.
Philip Heasley: Yes, but another way of answering what Scott answered is that our FCF expectations – we don’t guide on FCF and we want you to know that we very comfortably made our FCF expectations for the quarter.
Blake Anderson: That’s good to hear. I appreciate it.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions.
Philip Heasley: Thanks everybody for joining. Look forward to catching up with everybody in the coming weeks.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.";[0.15105615723911403, -0.011487060541160332];-0.011487060541160332;0.15105615723911403;1
6;ACIW;2018-11-10;"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to today's ACI Worldwide Reports Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines are currently muted to prevent any background noise and we will have a question-and-answer session after the speakers' remarks. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Mr. John Kraft. Sir, the floor is yours.
John Kraft: Thank you, Grace and morning everybody. Today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning's call is Phil Heasley, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. But before I turn it over to Phil I'd like to let folks know about several upcoming investor events. We will be attending Citi -- Citibank's 2018 Financial Technology Conference in New York next Monday and Tuesday, November 12th and 13th. We will then host our annual Analyst Day in Naples, next Wednesday, November 14th. Later this month, we will be attending the Credit Suisse 22nd Annual Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on Tuesday, November 27th. ACI will be hosting an additional and similar analyst event in London, Thursday, November 29th. And lastly, we will be attending the Bank of America Merrill Lynch's 2018 Leverage Finance Conference in Boca Raton on December 5th. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Phil.
Philip Heasley: Thanks John and good morning everyone. I will spend the next few minutes providing deeper insight into quarter three. I'll focus my comments on the customer and market trends through the lens of ACI's two P&Ls, six solutions and four customer segments by sharing key customer wins that highlight our global traction. I will then turn the call over to Scott for the financial review. Jumping right in, I'm pleased to report that our quarter three revenue growth and EBITDA growth were ahead of expectations and that allowed us to raise our full year 2018 guidance. Bookings are up year-to-date and with the strong and exciting pipeline of new business across all four target segments, we remain optimistic for the rest of 2018 and beyond. In a moment, I'll highlight key new contracts and renewed strategic relationships and we will now begin with a quarter three recap. Year-to-date, new bookings were up 27% and total bookings were up 25%, up renewals to our new technology are a major element of this bookings growth. Both of our P&Ls, ACI On Premise and ACI On Demand are performing well. In our ACI On Premise business, quarter three revenue was up 12% from last year. This growth is the result of key global trends around payments modernization, open banking, and real-time payments. Additionally, we once again continued our virtually 100% adoption rate for customers renewing in the UP Retail Payments Solution or RPS program. We also continued to see considerable global demand for our real-time and immediate payments solutions. We are working closely with PayNet, the national financial market infrastructure provider for Malaysia. PayNet utilizes our UP Immediate Payments Solution and expects to launch its pay to proxy service known as Do It Now to the public next month. Separately, we also announced the major go live with e-mail financial group, achieved in just nine months. Additionally, another long-term ACI customer, which is a subsidiary of a major global bank customer, has selected our UP real-time payments solution we should be used to process wires. Moving on to our ACI On Demand business, quarter three revenues increased 5% from last year. A key driver of growth is global merchant demand for our highly secure platform-based e-commerce and omnichannel payment solutions. An example is one of the largest global merchant apparel brands. The company selected ACI's payment fraud management solution as part of its global e-commerce and omnichannel strategy. Within ACI On Demand, we also continued to see strong traction for bill payment solutions among vertical markets in the U.S. such as higher education, consumer finance, and healthcare. I also want to reiterate the continued traction we're seeing in the market due to our 6421 approach. To recap, the 6421, we match our six software-based payment solutions, retail payments, real-time payments, payments intelligence, merchant payments as well as bill payments in digital channels to the market needs of four target segments; banks, intermediaries, merchants, and corporates; delivered to the flexibility of our two licensing models in ACI On Demand and ACI On Premise; and leveraging our one ACI global team and intellectual property. 6421 corporate transition is a highlight some of the more significant contracts we signed in quarter three across our four customer segments. I'll start with the banking segment where we closed several major contracts. ABN AMRO, one of the top three retail and corporate banks in the Netherlands, signed a renewal contract to use UP Retail Payments as part of its actual banking transformation. Another leading global bank that extended its licensing relationship with ACI that include the UP Framework and will continue to work with us in 2019 to find ATM processing strategy. Itau, the largest private bank in Brazil with strong growing presence across Latin America and other key global market selected ACI's UP payment risk management solution to provide multi-dimensional fraud monitoring tool 360-degree view of events. ACI helps the bank prevent fraud and money laundering across all of its businesses from a single solution. Moving to the intermediary segment, some of our key wins include Stet, one of the largest automated clearing houses in Europe selected ACI's cloud-based UP payments to jointly deliver a new service to its member banks as a single view for center wide instant payments. Supporting 17 banks across Hungary key systems selected ACI's UP immediate payments solution to interface into the local Hungarian immediate payment scheme. DXC Technology, the world's leading independent and IT services company has extended its relationship with UP payments supporting a leading Canadian bank. High Payment Solutions, HPS, a Mongolian payment processor selected ACI's UP Immediate Payments and UP Merchant Payments solution as it builds the country's national payment hub. HPS will lend more than 14 banks in the country and will expand to billers, e-commerce, and merchants with international e-commerce connections. Moving to merchants, this segment continues to see increased global adoption of platform-based omnichannel and e-commerce solutions such as global -- such as a global power merchant I mentioned a few minutes ago. In addition, CONS, one of the consumer goods retailers in the U.S., selected UP Bill Payments to replace manual labor intensive selling processes through increased digital relationship with its customer. And finally, I'll turn to the corporate segment, where we're seeing more organizations moving their bill payment infrastructure to platform. Key wins include Maricopa County, the fourth largest county in the U.S. in terms of population, a longtime customer of our UP Bill Payments solution. They've extended their relationship with ACI through middle of 2022. EnerBank, a leading U.S. finance company for contract has selected ACI's UP Bill Payments solution for one-time payments, recurring payments, e-bill, printed statements and text to pay. One of the oldest and largest financial services firms in the United States previously outsourced student loan portfolio in-house, utilizing ACI's UP Bill Payments Solution for our repayment to those student loans. In addition to the continued customer traction for our UP Solutions, the industry is also taking notice. I wanted to mention recent recognition received from industry analyst community. We were named a leader in the Forrester Wave for Global Merchant Payment Providers. ACI received the highest possible score in criteria of omnichannel solution vision and market press in category. We were the only non-acquirer in this comparative report and we're highlighted for providing a vast global reach with superior flexibility. Our Digital banking platform, Universal Online Banker was recognized as best-in-class by Aite in its recent cash management, a benchmarking study. The comparative report noted that the Universal Online Bankers showed strength and stressed the functionality and has the best open API enabled architecture providing greater flexibility and a new modern interface. As I conclude, based on the momentum we are seeing, I wanted to reiterate that we are very optimistic as we close out our fiscal year. With that, I'll pass the baton to Scott to provide his quarter three financial commentary and longer-term outlook. Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Thanks Phil and good morning everyone. I first go through the highlights of the third quarter and then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of 2018. We'll then open the line for questions. I'll be starting my comments on slide six with key takeaways from the quarter. Q3 was another solid quarter for us with total bookings up 37% over Q3 last year, which brings us to 25% growth year-to-date. New bookings were down on a quarterly basis, but up 27% year-to-date, and we continue to expect full year in the bookings growth to be in the low double digits. Our 12-month and 60-month backlog declined $7 million and $112 million respectively, which is not unusual just prior to the heavy bookings quarter we normally see in Q4. We saw strong revenue growth with Q3 revenue of $246 million, up 9% over Q3 last year. Revenue from our On Premise segment was up 12% over last year while revenue from our On Demand segment was up 5% over last year. This revenue growth contributed to strong EBITDA growth, up 28% over last year. Our On Premise segment EBITDA margin was 55%, up from 52% last year and our On Demand segment on its path to improved profitability saw EBITDA margins of 5%, up from a negative 2% last year. In Q3, we generated $21 million of free cash flow, up significantly from the $4 million generated in Q3 last year. We ended the quarter with $76 million in cash and a debt balance of $689 million. Also during the quarter, we refinanced our long-term bonds at a lower interest rate and an eight-year tenure, strengthening our financial position and giving us greater flexibility to invest in future growth opportunities. Turning next to slide seven with our outlook. As a reminder, effective January 1 of this year, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, which replaces ASC 605. In a bit presenting our key financial results on both the new and old basis for all of 2018. Given the outperformance in Q3 and the mix and timing of our new bookings and renewal activity for the rest of the year, we are raising our full year guidance under ASC 606. We now expect results for the year to be similar under both ASC 605 and 606. So, for the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be between $1.05 billion and $1.075 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect new bookings growth to be in the low double-digits for the remainder of 2018. And based on how we are positioned as we exit the year, we are comfortable reaffirming our longer range outlook for 2019 and 2020 EBITDA. So, that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question came from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson. Your line is open.
Pete Heckmann: Hey good morning. Nice results. A lot of information there on new clients. Can you talk a little bit about specifically two niches, I may have missed them, but within the merchant space, whether it's e-commerce or the gateway, so many things that are working there and then as well giving us some update on fraud. How are those two contributing to growth year-to-date?
Philip Heasley: Well, merchant omnichannel and our merchant platform offerings are doing extremely well on a year-to-year basis. And of course, payment intelligence fraud is an important piece of it. We are seeing very good interest from a pipeline and actually from beginning to go live with some of this omnichannel customers, who have that -- doing business with their customer as the hub is the denominator of their business. So it's going very -- it's beginning to go very, very well. We're beginning to see whether you call them merchants, whether you call them corporate's, more and more companies are selling directly to people who love their brands, and that's really -- that's wind behind our back in terms of being able to give them the capabilities they need to accomplish that.
Pete Heckmann: Okay, that's helpful. And then I think your guidance for new business bookings for the year is still to be up in the low double-digits. If my numbers are correct, what's like the first three quarters, you're up around 26%, 27%. So, does that perhaps imply that your guidance could prove conservative? Or maybe you're expecting a bit of a softer fourth quarter?
Scott Behrens: No, I would say we are comfortable with the guidance. Your math is right in terms of the year-to-date; new bookings and I think we're comfortable kind of in line with that after the year.
Pete Heckmann: Okay, great. Let me get back in the queue and I may come back. Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
George Sutton: Thank you. Great results, guys. So, Phil, it feels like a bit of a statement quarter from my perspective, specifically when we look at things that we've been looking for a long time like On Demand margins really starting to kick-in. You've talked for a long time about large transformational deals. I'm curious is this the start of what we're seeing in terms of those or are these just more garden-variety wins from your perspective?
Philip Heasley: Well, I think sometimes the market underestimates the value of -- we had the industry-leading solution in the old technology. Instead of trying to catch the fallen knight, we try to make a spear out of it and transform it to a new technology. With virtually 100% renewal rate into our new technology, I think we feel what would be a very, very big deal for other co-competitors and whatnot is a very, very good deal for us, both in securing our historic business as well as getting that 25% to 30% growth on top of it by being able to do a lot more for our customers with our new real-time, agnostic, low-cost solutions that meet the times. So, yes, I do think that -- I do think and I think the embrace by the omnichannel is very -- I think we would be viewed very differently if all we did was omnichannel. Now, if you look at the other players that were up in that quadrant with albeit they're mostly acquirers and a lot of them are our customers, which is a double complement to us. And I think we're feeling very good, George.
George Sutton: Got you. On the immediate payment side and I don't want to steal thunder from your Analyst Day, but you talked about Malaysia. I'm curious if you can give us a bigger picture, thought process over the relative near term with prospective markets like India, and Brazil, and Indonesia, and Canada, et cetera?
Philip Heasley: Well, I think we can give you a lot better framework next week because we're going to go through it in a level of detail. But probably I don't know the exact number, but we're probably up to 85%, 90% of global GDP is embracing immediate instant, whatever they want to call it, payments and their understanding is this e-commerce world that we live in, and it also has a lot less risk on a bank-to-bank basis than traditional delayed payments. So, be it Australia, be it -- we talked to you about Mongolia, whether it's Malaysia, whether it's Great Britain, the United States, Canada. We're involved in an awful lot of these and the nice thing is they're beginning to come to market as first you've got to sell them then you've got to implement them, then you got to go live and then you've got to get the volumes from the go live. So it's nice that we're covering the whole spectrum right now from having a good pipeline to just beginning to see real transactions come out to the other side.
George Sutton: Super. Look forward to seeing everybody next week.
Philip Heasley: Thank you.
Operator: We don't have any questions at this time. I will turn the call over back to the management for any closing remarks.
Philip Heasley: Well, thanks everybody, for dialing in. We look forward to seeing folks at the coming events and at our Analyst Day. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation. This concludes our conference for today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.";[0.0781461913066841, 0.07715529258015974];0.07715529258015974;0.0781461913066841;1
7;ACIW;2019-03-01;"Operator: Good morning. My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Reports Q4 Earnings and Acquisition of Speedpay Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Kraft. Please go ahead, sir.
John Kraft: Thanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everybody. Today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning's call is Phil Heasley, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil.
Philip Heasley: Thank you, John and thank you everyone for joining today's call. I'll focus on two topics today. I'll start with a perspective of our 2018 financial results and then I'll discuss ACI's acquisition of Speedpay from Western Union that we just announced this morning. I will then turn the call over to Scott for detailed financials on both topics. Let me start by saying as I look back I would characterize 2018 as a year of strains for ACI on a number of levels. It also a year that came to an unexpected revenue and EBITDA finish. I'll start with the 2018 strengths. ACI delivered strong bookings throughout the year, new bookings were up 22% and we added more than 100 new customers. It is exciting for ACI to be taking part in and benefiting from a number of exciting new and innovative industry growth areas, particularly real time payments, merchant e-commerce payments and payments intelligence. As I've mentioned on my previous call ACI is well regarded by leading research analyst firms including Forrester, just as we received two more awards for our real time payment solutions. Frost & Sullivan's 2019 Global Product Leadership Award and MEFTECH's Best Use Of Emerging or Innovative Technology in the Middle East. Another bright spot in 2018 was our ACI On Demand platform P&L, with our investment phase largely behind us ACI On Demand turned the corner to profitability delivering its first full year of positive EBITDA, more volume and scale will further accelerate the growth and profitability of ACI On Demand. And this is a key part of the rationale behind the acquisition of Speedpay, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes. Cash continues to be a core strength for us. In 2018 cash flow from operating activities was $184 million, up 26% from 2017 and adjusted operating cash flow was $148 million, up 14% from 2017. I'll transition now and share a sampling of notable quarter four wins and renewals. In our banks and financial intermediary segment, Bank Safra, one of the largest bank in Brazil selected Up Retail Payments to support aggressive growth in new business requirements for its Safra pay offering merchant acquirers. Capitec one of the largest banks in South Africa and a long time ACI customer signed Up Retail Payments renewal to future proof its payments environment. Kiwi Bank Limited in New Zealand and a long time ACI customer increased focused on digital banking singed a renewal for Up Retail Payments. Arrow Financial Services, the leading provider of electronic payments outsourced in the Middle East and North Africa also selected Up Retail Payments. The company requires state-of-the-art open platform to help its clients differentiate themselves in the marketplace. NETS which operates Singapore's national switching network and is responsible for providing critical infrastructure will leverage Up Retail Payments to address new market requirements, add new payment types and deliver payment innovation. Transbank, the largest acquirer in Chile and longtime ACI customer selected Up Retail Payments as part of its drive to become a more agile, innovative and secure payment services provider. Transbank also licensed our proactive risk manager and API manager. Now moving on to our Merchant and Corporate segments, Coca Cola bottlers, sales and service which is owned by more than 65 independent Coca Cola bottlers signed a renewal for Up Merchant Services. ACI powers their cash list enabled vending devices today and they plan to grow the number of cash less enabled devices in the coming years. They also wish to expand the offering outside of North America. Albertsons one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States and a long time ACI customers selected Up Merchant Services as their next generation payment platform. ACI was selected for its flexible architecture and industry leading security standards, the IRS and long-term customer signed renewal for our official payments, bill payment offering enabling consumers pay taxes using a credit or debit card or cash. These customers are just a stapling of the renewals and wins we secured in quarter four. Despite these important bright spots 2018 did not end as expected for revenue and EBITDA. Late in December we encountered unforeseen events that impacted our Q4 results and ultimately caused us to miss our guidance. These events included a major capital transaction in the financial service industry, which froze a significantly Up Retail Payments Solution contract that we expected to sign with one of the parties in December. This transaction took up and the industry by surprise and impacted the timing of our deal. However we expect these deals - these delayed contracts will come to provision in 2019 and we've increased our 2019 guidance as a result. Situation unfortunately dampened what was otherwise the year of progress and strength our business is strong and healthy, our RPS program continues its near 100% renewal rate with 25% to 30% value uplift. This positions us for steady organic growth and profitability for ACI in 2019 and beyond. I'll now turn to the acquisition we just announced this morning. With ACI On Demand ready to scale I'm pleased to share that we signed an agreement to acquire Speedpay Western Union's U.S. bill pay business. ACI is already positioned as a leader in bill pay a market that is still largely unconsolidated. With Speedpay ACI will deliver unified bill payment platform that will support billions of transactions. Together, the ACI and Speedpay bill pay solutions will serve more than 4,000 customers across the United States. We have combined vertical strength in the consumer finance, insurance, healthcare, higher education, utilities, government and mortgage industries. This will enable the combine business to more effectively serve a rapidly evolving category, as well as pursue additional segments such as digital subscriptions. The scale of ACI and Speedpay combined will transform both our bill pay business and the entire ACI On Demand P&L raising margins materially for both. This move to critical mass rates for phrase ACI's AOD will enable us to fuel more growth investments and innovation across the entire AOD portfolio, including the merchant real-time payments and payment intelligent solutions area that I mentioned earlier. We already invest more in R&D than most of the industry. The addition of Speedpay increases the money we can commit to advancing our next generation capabilities. I look forward to a healthy year ahead. I'm confident that ACI is well positioned to deliver our any payment every possibility strategy, the Speedpay acquisition accelerates our ability to capitalize on the growing global payment transaction opportunities over the next five years. As the market show some customers needing to execute millions of transactions to needing to execute billions of transactions per month, per week and even per day. ACI is uniquely positioned to scale to meet that demand. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott for his financial commentary.
Scott Behrens: Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through our results for 2018 then provide guidance for 2019, as well as financial details of the acquisition of Speedpay that we announced this morning. We'll then open the line for questions. I'll be starting my comments on slide seven, with key takeaways from the year, just as a reminder effective January 1, 2018 we adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606, which replaced ASC 605. For all of my prepared comments I'll be discussing our results on a constant GAAP basis. As Phil discussed, we saw strong bookings growth on the year with new bookings up 22% and total bookings up 15%. We ended the year with 60-months backlog of $4.2 billion and the 12-months backlog of $811 million. 2018 revenue was $1.012 billion, down slightly from 2017 and adjusted EBITDA was $261 million or essentially flat with 2017. As Phil mentioned, our final 2018 revenue and EBITDA was impacted by unforeseen events, which included recent capital markets transaction in the financial services sector that delayed certain revenue producing contracts in the fourth quarter. These deals are now expected to close in 2019 and are reflected in our higher outlook for EBITDA this year, compared to our prior guidance. Turning next to our two P&L, our ACI On Premise segment, which was impacted by the timing of the deals that were delayed around year-end, so our revenues declined 3% in 2018. This segment continues to generate strong EBITDA margins delivering 56% in 2018, down slightly from last year's 58%. Our ACI On Demand segment are grew 2% in 2018 and now represents 43% of our total revenue. We've been saying for some time now that margin expansion will come with scale as we grow into the infrastructure that we've built out over the last several years. In 2018, we started to see that margin expansion with our On Demand segment delivering a 600 basis point improvement on net EBITDA margins. And now to jump ahead, but the acquisition of Speedpay will allow us to accelerate that scale by layering on revenue and EBITDA on top of that scalable infrastructure. We saw strong cash flow growth in 2018 with operating free cash flow of $148 million, up 14% over the last year. We ended the year with $149 million in cash and a debt balance of $685 million. We close out the year with a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of roughly 2 times, which is below our targeted leverage 2.5 times. In 2018, we continued our trend of deploying about a third of our cash flow for share repurchases, for the year we repurchased 2.3 million shares for roughly $54 million, which equates to an average price of just over $23 a share. And we currently have $176 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Turning next to slide eight, with our guidance. Just a note here the follow guidance does not reflect any contribution from the Speedpay transaction. We plan to update our 2019 guidance for the financial impact of the transaction upon closing. So for 2019, we expect revenue to be in a range of $1.1 billion to $1.125 billion, which represents 9% to 11% growth over 2018. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $310 million to $325 million, which is up from our prior range of $300 million to $315 million. As we now expect certain revenue and EBITDA producing contracts that were delayed around year-end to come in, in 2019. We expect the 2019 quarterly phasing of revenue and EBITDA to generally be consistent with 2018, new bookings are expected to be in the high single to low double-digits and operating free cash flow in 2019 is expected to be in a range of $165 million to $180 million. For the first quarter, we expect to generate between $205 million and $215 million of revenue. And note that this range does not include the impact of carry over deals from 2018. We expect the most likely timing of these deals to be in Q2 or Q3 of this year. And finally, our 2020 EBITDA target is unchanged at $335 million to $350 million. And to help with your modeling, you'll find additional guidance assumptions on slide nine. Interest expense to be $39 million and cash interest to be $36 million, capital expenditures are expected to approximate $50 million, G&A is expected to approximate $100 million, non-cash compensation expense should approximate $35 million. Pass through interchange revenues are expected to be in a range of $180 million to $185 million. Cash taxes are expected to approximate $40 million and our effective tax rate should be consistent with 2018, which was right around 25%. And lastly, our diluted share count should be around $117 million, which excludes future share buyback activities. Moving - finally slide 10, we're very excited to announce the acquisition of Speedpay, in 2018 Speedpay generated more than $350 million in revenue and over $90 million in EBITDA. Our purchase price of $750 million represents a multiple of approximately 2 times revenue and 8 times EBITDA and that is excluding the value of the tax benefits in any potential synergy. The acquisition will be structured as an asset purchase for U.S. tax purposes pursuant to 338 H10 election. As a result of this election we'll be able to amortize any goodwill and intangible associated with the acquisition. We estimate the net present value of this tax benefit to approximate $100 million. And overall, we expect the transaction to be double-digit accretive in the first full year on an adjusted EPS basis. Speedpay is a 100% recurring revenue model will improve our overall recurring revenue from 65% of total revenue today to 74% on a pro forma basis. And as I mentioned previously, Speedpay will also allow us to accelerate the scale in our On Demand segment by layering on revenue and EBITDA on to our scalable infrastructure. We have 100% committed financing through an incremental term loan and a revolver draw. We expect pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio to be under 4 times at closing and a significant free cash flow generation from the combined business should allow us to delever quickly. We expect within 24 months of closing that our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to generally be in line with our targeted leverage ratio of 2.5 times. We expect the transaction to close by the end of Q2 against subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. And finally, as I mentioned already, we plan to provide updated 2019 guidance and 2020 outlook upon closing the transaction. So that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Eller with Wells Fargo.
David Eller: Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. I wondered on the Speedpay acquisition, if you could just talk a little bit about the deal process. So, when did you start looking at this, was it a competitive process? And then, also if you could talk about the fundamentals of the business? So I think you mentioned it's a carve out transaction, so has revenue and EBITDA are those kind of both growing, flat, down just any kind of color there?
Philip Heasley: I'll start and Scott you should - we've been working on this acquisition - well, it's been in our sights for a long time, right. We've been talking for eight, eight and a half months in terms of doing it. To the best of our knowledge, it was a - there was a competitive process, right. We spent a lot of time really understanding this business as it relates to our business. In terms of the - we view the combinations of the verticals with our verticals, as very synergistic. We have been doing a lot of work on building the backend, of building a world class backend, they've put a lot of energy into building a world class frontend. So the combination of the two R&D efforts is very synergistic. We're going to actually invest more on top of that. We expect this to be a growth business and not be negative to AOD's growth plans, and whatnot. Very importantly, is that, we're very heavily into the e-commerce. We're very heavily into the merchants business. There is a tremendous crossover taking place from the e-commerce side of the business needing the ability to have biller capabilities. They won't necessarily call it biller capabilities and whatnot, but they need an efficient non-card rail in order to get all these new non-card payments added on to the traditional ways of doing their payments. And this very synergistically add to what we've been working on for a decade on to the biller businesses that we had already purchased with this exact strategy in mind. And this gives us the critical mass to do it in an effective manner. Scott did you…
Scott Behrens: No, I think the only thing I'd add to that is, I - we obviously have a large biller portfolio, I'd say the trends in that business are pretty consistent financial trends from what we're seeing. Really the compelling rationale here is the ability to combine the R&D spend from both businesses and really accelerate new feature functions in marketplace.
David Eller: Got it. And then, I guess, if you could also talk a little bit about the capital markets transaction in the financial services industry that you mentioned, what was that exactly? Was that domestic and why would that push into Q2, Q3 versus maybe Q1?
Philip Heasley: Well, we - of course we're not going to tell you, which one of our customers it is, it wouldn't be fair to our customers, or which customers it was. When there's mergers and it's unannounced merger we can - we may think we have a piece of business that's 99%, it's virtually signed and then it lands up getting unsigned because of - or not signed delayed, because it has to be worked into the combination of the two businesses. In our history on our 44-year history as a company as the financial services industry is consolidated, we've unfortunately had to deal with this lumpiness. The good news is that it tends to create incremental opportunity, incremental value it doesn't tend to limit value, but it certainly doesn't fit well into 90-day reporting schemes.
David Eller: Got it. And then kind of last question for me going back to the acquisition. As I understand it On Demand segment as you've kind of built that out there has been a little bit of a - if you build it, they will come kind of mentality. And so it just seems like it's always - their goal has been to get more volume over that platform, whether through organic growth or through M&A. So, is that the right way to think about this deal. As you're getting the volume, you need to scale that or are there other kind of more strategic factors as well?
Philip Heasley: Well, let me put it this way. We spent - we've told you that we spent well over 100 - we spent a very large amount of money building out a forward looking AOD infrastructure, and we consolidated 28 data centers from different kinds of acquisitions. And it was quite honestly a painful, grueling task and we said that one of the things we were coming out of it with was that we could grow our business 10x easily and our infrastructure would be able to hold it. It would be incremental - the cost would be incremental. So this is the first proof point, because we're buying a business, we're not taking data centers, we're not taking locations and all that kind of stuff. We're taking business and we're putting into our built out infrastructure and we're levering the technological and infrastructural investments that we made to - why it's such an accretive. It's a very, very accretive deal because yes, we spent a bunch of this money coming into it, or investment coming into it.
David Eller: Great. And then, do you have any high level estimate of what your market share might be post the deal?
Philip Heasley: I think the top four guys probably still don't have a quarter of this market. There's everybody and their brother is in this market in a miscellaneous way and the top four players, maybe have a quarter of the market.
David Eller: Great, thank you so much for the answers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Heckmann with D.A. Davidson and Company.
Unidentified Analyst: Just on for Pete. Thanks for taking our questions. So I was hoping you could help us put a few ranges on the Speedpay deal. Firstly, the EPS accretion that we're expecting in the first year. And then, any cost synergies that we're expecting. And then, following up on one of the earlier questions, the growth rates that the asset has been seeing?
Scott Behrens: Yes, on the - we said in the materials that we expect in the first year double-digit EPS percent of accretion. So I'd stick it out what we think we're going to see in the first year. Sorry, what was the other question.
Unidentified Analyst: Cost synergies and then that growth rate?
Scott Behrens: The cost synergy, we don't - because this is a carve out we're not expecting, I would say significant cost synergies. In fact, we're actually likely to invest in the R&D in a bit in the kind of go to market areas. But what this does have is a pretty sizable tax benefit, the way we're treating it under the tax clause, we're treating it as an asset purchase versus a share purchase. So that's going to deliver pretty substantial tax deduction and thus cash tax savings overtime. So, we've estimated that net present value to be around $100 million. And from a growth perspective, again, as I mentioned earlier I think if you look at their growth profile, very, I would say similar to our biller business growth profile. Over the last several years we've seen transaction growth, but some pricing pressure on renewals. And so you'll see that the top line growth is a little muted by that. But we think we've worked through that as a marketplace that we've worked through a lot of that repricing.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. That's really helpful. And then, so how are you expecting the Speedpay deal to position the company in terms of share in bill pay. So are we to look at ACI being a top three player in the niche or something around that?
Scott Behrens: No, I think I would just reiterate what Phil said, I think between the handful of top it's a very fragmented space. The handful, the largest ones are probably still only make up a quarter of the market. So, plenty of room here for growth both organically as well as is consolidation in the space.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then, just lastly a little bit of a more information on 2019. What type of growth and margin improvement should we be expecting for On Demand in 2019?
Scott Behrens: Well, we saw a pretty substantial margin improvement in 2018, 600 basis point improvement. I would think that the On Demand business will see the top line growth kind of the higher end of our range. And it's going to continue to drive pretty healthy margin expansion. Again with the investment that we've put in, in this infrastructure, what we're able to do is - and the scalability of that infrastructure is the incremental dollar of revenue is able to pull through at a pretty high rate of EBITDA. So, we expect to see pretty continued healthy margin expansion in that space. And I would say that even on a - call it on organic basis excluding the impact of Speedpay. Speedpay is just going to allow us to accelerate the margin expansion in this business as we're able to layer on their revenue, their customers on top of the scalable infrastructure.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Riley with Mercator Advisory.
Brian Riley: Hi. I have two questions that I'd like to hear about. And the first is, is it correct to assume that the Speedpay clients are moving over to the bill pay platform or is there going to be some kind of parallel run on the systems.
Philip Heasley: No, we've done extensive looking at the new front end of Speedpay and we intend to invest - continue to invest heavily in it. But we're very comfortable with the front end of Speedpay. Overtime, we will be converting their backend to our more sophisticated backend, as its finished. But with the front end being moved, the customers' real impact is already behind, as they move over to the next gen front end capabilities of Speedpay. They have an excellent new front end.
Brian Riley: That make sense. Now, so if my accounts are right, since 2005 this makes - this is probably acquisition number 13. And of course it's been one sale off with Pfizer along the way. How is the whole play on the one ACI movement going? You're integrating a lot there, is everything going as well as it looks on the outside?
Philip Heasley: Yes, well our greatest asset it's not all these acquisitions, but it's the 4,000 people that we have all around the world that are very focused and very capable. And one ACI is about coming, we could spend hours talking about what means, but it's a culture that's focused on payments whether you're part of the pre-13 acquisitions or part of the 13 acquisitions and our management, as well as our people are - and that mixture of them. It's actually going extremely - the courage that these guys have gone through to take a bunch of companies that really had long in the tooth technologies, but great underlying services and to think that we're coming into 2019 in a fully Linux-enabled, fully cloud-enabled kind of basis with innovations around database and infrastructure. It's really a tribute to the - I'd love to take credit for it myself, but it's really is the one ACI family that has delivered this. And I think the Speedpay will fit, we were really, really impressed we did a lot of work in contacting the customers and understanding how the customers felt about how they were being managed and what their interactions were and whatnot. And we think that the 145, 150 people that are going to be joining us are going to add very strongly to that one ACI culture.
Brian Riley: Great. Thank you, Phil.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens.
Brett Huff: Good morning, guys. Congrats on the deal.
Philip Heasley: Thanks, Brett.
Brett Huff: A couple quick questions, one follow-up to a question was asked before on the On Demand revenue growth, it was down a little bit this quarter. And I think Scott you're - you said it was maybe going to be at the high-end of the 9% to 11% type growth this year. Are there particular products that, that you expect to drive that on an organic basis that seem to be working well at this point?
Philip Heasley: Well, when you think about AOD, you got to think about it in terms of its three core pieces, right? So we'll take you through it in three pieces. Because we have the biller I am going to keep biller separately, I might talk to two. But we have our platform business. We have our single instance SaaS business and we have the biller business. And I think we have PAY.ON and ReD and the merchants platform and whatnot. And we've had - when you look at 2018, we had growth - we had very, very strong growth in our new products. I mean, we had some growth that was - that in fourth quarter in certain product groups exceeded 50% year-to-year. On the other side, being a transformational business, we're in the process of getting out of the single instance SaaS business. So when you look at it from an AOD revenue stream, and you transfer from single instance SaaS platform, you have what looks like a lack of revenue growth, but you see EBITDA growth and it's kind of going from the more expensive, SaaS environment to the more efficient platform environment. So it's kind of hard to see under the covers that way. In terms of biller, we didn't see - we did not see deterioration in that category and we expect to see growth in 2019 and beyond. And yes, we were saying it was the higher - that AOD itself would be at the higher end of that range. So we've gone from being a drag to an accelerator.
Brett Huff: Great, that's helpful. Thank you. Second question is on the capital markets contract delay, I know you can't say too much, but was that going to be a renewal, or was that going to be a new contract? Could you give us that inside?
Philip Heasley: Well, it's contracts and it's combination of both.
Brett Huff: Okay.
Philip Heasley: And like I said, we've been running up - we've been running just about 100% on the renewal side.
Brett Huff: And then last question for me, did you - you gave us some stats around what your pro forma bill pay business will look like. Did you - I don't think you mentioned this, are you willing to share it. What will your pro forma revenue or percentage of revenue the - once you get this new bill pay business integrated on an annual basis if you're willing to give us that inside?
Scott Behrens: Well, our bill pay business - I mean, I can just give you the numbers. Our bill pay business in 2018 was around $275 million of revenue where they're going to layer around $350 million and that's at a gross revenue level.
Brett Huff: And then, last question this is all biller direct right they didn't have any consolidator business?
Scott Behrens: Correct.
Philip Heasley: 100%, correct.
Brett Huff: Great. Thank you guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Sutton with Craig Hallum.
George Sutton: Thank you. I am curious about the messaging or the logic behind the - you're going to market with a new debt deal or an increased debt deal as a result of this acquisition. But you also meaningfully increased your share repurchase authorization, and you have been active there. So I'm just curious if you can give us the board driven logic there. Obviously, it suggests comfort with the business model.
Scott Behrens: Yeah, I would just say - I mean, 2018, we use about, what equates to about a third of our cash flow for share repurchases. So, that's pretty consistent with our historical pattern. Yes, in the year we had an increase in the share authorization. So yes, I would just say that we continued that trend of deploying about a third of our free cash flow for share buyback.
Philip Heasley: A very - and everyone has their own models, but no one really follows us that much from a cash standpoint. Businesses there's SEC rules and everyone's got to report their businesses the way the government says to report it. We look at cash as the as earned way that you actually run the business and we are not happy that we had the deferred contract, but we still ended up about $30 million higher than the street thought we were going to have in cash. And the cash is just an important component we guide to - we give you ranges every year and whatnot and it is something that we're extremely comfortable and it's extremely predictable we're as much more predictable than how you book revenue under 605 or 606 it's how your customers pay you for what you're doing. So, yes George, we're very comfortable with the model.
George Sutton: Great, no that was my sense. So I also was curious on real time payments you haven't addressed a lot on the call, but a lot of continued growth in Malaysia, Hungary, U.S., Canada broadly, can you just talk about how your opportunities sit in the real time payments landscape?
Philip Heasley: We're working on projects all over the world, I think our Canadian project is coming live, our Malaysian project I think in March is going to be the big ceremony for that coming live, Australia is in phases. There's work going on, we have work in France, it was significant work being done in France right now, in terms of it. Immediate payments is the new payment type, but also a lot of people are trying to get to the not finish line, which is what I call the starting line, everyone's trying to get ready to actually do immediate payments. Once Zell opened up, I think it became really clear that the demand for immediate payments and that's a different flavor of it is a lot more real. India is probably the place in the world to watch because the entire country, its central banking infrastructure and whatnot is pretty much forcing an immediate payment model that I think will land up taking over a lot of the world. Difference being is that it's going to have to be a $0.03, $0.04, $0.05 transaction not a $0.10 for the card guys, $0.30 for the acquirers and interchange on the other side they're talking about Nicole rate kinds of payments and they're talking about $100 billion of them that's going to change the world in terms of how payments take place. And I actually think it's how e-commerce takes place originates in one part of the world and gets satisfied the amount of FX costs in e-commerce right now is perhaps growth is more important than margin perhaps right now. But the day that margin becomes important that cost the cost of payments is going to be the first thing that's attract.
George Sutton: Perfect. Scott as I'm thinking about a one other thing, relativity to your 2019 guidance raise. Is that 100% related to this specific deal that we're talking about or were there other pushes and pulls that are reflected?
Scott Behrens: Well I'd say it's generally related to the delayed deal. So that's why as we said we didn't necessarily update our 2020 outlook for EBITDA partly because this is just dynamic between 2018 to 2019.
George Sutton: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time.
Philip Heasley: Thanks everybody. We look forward to catching up in the coming weeks.
Operator: Thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
8;ACIW;2019-05-11;"Operator: Good morning, Ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Reports First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Now it’s my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. John Kraft. The floor is yours.
John Kraft: Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everybody. Today’s call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning’s call is Phil Heasley, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Phil.
Phil Heasley: Thank you, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining today’s call. I’m pleased to start off by saying that this morning we announced the completion of the acquisition of Speedpay from Western Union. I will spend the next few minutes covering both the immediate as well as longer-term strategic opportunities for ACI made available as a result of the Speedpay acquisition. Next, I’ll share a sampling of Q1 wins and demonstrate momentum across our key bank, intermediary, merchant and corporate customer segments. I will then turn the call over to Scott to cover our Q1 financial results and updated 2019 guidance. Let me start by saying that the acquisition of Speedpay is exciting and significant to ACI on several levels. First, it brings immediate financial strength and scale to our ACI On Demand platform business. With our investment phase largely behind us, ACI On Demand has turned the corner to profitability and delivered its first full year of positive EBITDA in 2018. The acquisition brings together two market-leading the U.S. bill payment portfolios with the combined revenue of over $600 million in 2018. The acquisition brings tremendous scale to our ACI On Demand business. It enhances our profitability, boosts recurring revenues, drives efficiencies and enables increased investments in R&D and platform infrastructure that will benefit our entire UP portfolio. We plan to combine the Speedpay and ACI Bill Payments solutions into a unified platform capable of supporting billions of transactions and driving next-generation bill pay capabilities. We will also expand our reach into existing and complementary segments such as consumer finance, insurance, healthcare, higher education, utilities, government and mortgage. The combination of Speedpay and ACI is also exciting as it brings together the industry’s top talent under one roof. As we join forces, we will drive innovation and revolutionize payment for thousands of customers. I want to take this opportunity to welcome our Speedpay colleagues and clients into the one ACI family. We are honored to be working with you. Strategically moving forward, this acquisition also accelerates the delivery of ACI’s Any Payment, Every Possibility vision to serve a broader opportunity, real-time digital payment experience of merchants, corporates and billers. The lines are blurring as the needs of these segments are rapidly converging driven by the adoption of digital and mobile channels, the move to real-time non-card payments and the growth of digital subscriptions and recurring payments. We’re all likely familiar with the explosion of choices and the increasing number of recurring services that are now an integral part of the typical consumer’s daily experience, from streaming media and digital marketplaces to subscription-based home deliveries. Providing a real-time, frictionless and secure digital payment experience is critical to vendors that want to capitalize on this market opportunity. ACI anticipates the strength will continue to accelerate across the consumer and B2B markets. And we’ve architected our UP solution portfolio to be ready to help our customers serve these digital payment business models. Our investment in R&D continues to outpace the competition, and we’ve built important new digital payment capabilities for e-commerce, merchant omni-channel, real-time payments and payments intelligence over the last 12 months. In conjunction with our Speedpay acquisition, we acquired Walletron. Walletron provides innovative mobile wallet payment and loyalty capabilities. Now as part of ACI’s UP portfolios, consumers can build – can view bills and make quicker payments right from their Apple Wallet or Google Pay on their smartphones. Said a little differently, we now can connect iOS or Android to a wallet experience. We have a lot more to share about this real-time digital payment experience vision and our UP solutions portfolio, and we will be hosting a special analyst webcast briefing on Tuesday, May 21, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time for those who want to learn. We will present our strategy for addressing and capitalizing on the rapidly growing and fast-evolving real-time digital payments opportunity. We’ll share how ACI is differentiated not only for our universal payment software leadership but also for our agnostic support of multiple payment methods and channels. I’ll now turn to the highlights from quarter one for new customer wins and renewal, starting with our corporate segment serving billing customers. But first, MFTX is a foreign exchange and payment solutions provider that serves clients ranging from individuals to large multinational corporations. MFTX selected ACI’s UP Bill Payment Solution to handle transactions within United States for its higher education clients. In related news, this quarter, we also unveiled the new ACI student payment portal. The new campus commerce solutions simplifies payments while improving security for higher education institutions. Turning now to wins in the merchant and intermediary segments. I’m pleased to announce that we expanded our relationship with WorldPay, a provider of secure payment services to merchants across 164 countries globally and in 15 different currencies. As WorldPay expands its services, the company has selected UP eCommerce payments to help manage an extensive alternative payment merchant network. Acapture, a leadings payment service provider and longtime ACI customer based in the Netherlands, also selected UP eCommerce payments as the company expands its reach across key vertical segments. Ronghan International (HK) Limited, a financial services company in Hong Kong, selected UP eCommerce payments for online payments and fraud control. Global Tel Link, a leading telecommunications company has selected ACI’s ReD Shield for fraud screening across the government and other contracted facilities. Shifting to the banking segment. ACI continues to see strong momentum for our UP Retail Payments and UP Real-Time Payments solutions. Wells Fargo, one of the country’s largest financial services company, has expanded its relationship with ACI. ACI powers Wells Fargo’s domestic and global wire operations. In addition, ALTO, a leading interbank switch in Indonesia, expanding its payment capabilities using UP Retail Payments solution as digital payment adoption accelerates in Indonesia, ACI’s UP Payments solution empowers ALTO to capture growing market opportunity. One of the big four banks in the People Republic of China has selected ACI’s UP Real-time Payments solution to improve operational efficiency and lower total cost of ownership for its New York branch operations. The bank will upgrade the Linux version of money transfer system and will move to commodity hardware. Finally, I’m pleased to share that ACI continues to win industry accolades. Earlier this quarter, ACI was recognized as the best payment solutions provider in Europe at the 2018 Global Banking and Finance Awards. UP eCommerce payments was also awarded for its technical flexibility and cross-border capabilities. Before I hand it off to Scott, I want to reiterate that ACI is well positioned for growth in 2019 and beyond. With the strong new bookings pipeline and the strategic acquisition of Speedpay, ACI is poised to capture even more quickly on the growing number of payment transactions occurring around the world each day. We’re on track financially for the year, and we’re updating our guidance for 2019. I’ll now turn it over to Scott to provide additional financial detail. Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Thanks, Phil. Good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through our results for Q1 and then provide an update for full year 2019, given the acquisition of Speedpay that we completed today. We’ll then open the line for questions. I’ll be starting my comments on Slide 7 with key takeaways from the quarter. New bookings were $70 million and total bookings were $112 million. Recall the Q1 saw particularly tough comparison given our record bookings in Q1 last year. We continue to expect full year in bookings to increase in the upper single to low double digits with our quarterly phasing of bookings for this year following a more traditional pattern with Q3 and Q4 being the highest bookings quarters for the year. We ended Q1 with a 12-month backlog of $811 million and 60-month backlog of $4.2 billion. Q1 revenue came in within our guidance expectations at $206 million with our On Demand business growing 5% over Q1 last year offset by lower revenue in our On Premise business. The decline in the On Premise business was due to the timing and size of renewal and capacity events in Q1 2019 compared to Q1 2018. The timing of our non-recurring license fee revenue will follow the expected timing of our bookings this year, as I mentioned, which will be heaviest in Q3 and Q4 this year. Revenue growth in our On Demand business contributed to strong improvement in net EBITDA margins. As we’ve been saying for some time now, margin expansion will come with scale as we grow into the infrastructure that we built out here over the last several years. As you recall, 2018 was really the turning point when we started to see that margin expansion in our On Demand segment. And we see continued margin expansion here in Q1 with net EBITDA margins increasing 600 basis points over Q1 of 2018, and that driven by combination of both revenue growth and lower expenses. And the contribution of Speedpay will allow us to accelerate that scale by layering on revenue and EBITDA on top of that leverageable infrastructure. ACI’s On Premise segment revenue is $96 million versus $105 million last year, which again was due to the timing of non-recurring license fees. On Premise segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 29% versus 37% last year as these non-recurring revenues generally have very high incremental margin. Adjusted operating free cash flow was $35 million, essentially flat with Q1 2018. We ended the quarter with $176 million in cash and $679 million in debt. With the acquisition of Speedpay, we do expect the pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to step up to just under 4x and a significant free cash flow generation of the combined business should allow us to delever quickly. We expect within 24 months our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to generally be in line with our targeted leverage ratio of 2.5x. And lastly here we have $176 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Turning next to Slide 8 with our update – updated 2019 guidance. In addition to announcing the completion of the Speedpay acquisition, we do remain on track for delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are updating our outlook for the full year 2019 given the contribution from Speedpay. We expect Speedpay to contribute between $215 million and $220 million in revenue and between $50 million and $55 million in adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of 2019. We now expect 2019 total revenue to be in the range of $1.315 billion to $1.345 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $360 million to $380 million, which excludes between $30 million and $35 million in one-time transaction and integration-related expenses. Also important to note here is the Speedpay’s 100% recurring revenue model will improve our combined recurring revenue from approximately 65% of total revenue today to near 75% on a pro forma basis. So this higher base of recurring revenue and its correlating recurring EBITDA should help reduce some of the quarterly volatility we see driven by the timing of our non-recurring license fees. We continue to expect new bookings growth to be in the upper single to low double digits. Operating free cash flow in 2019 is expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million. We are also updating here our 2020 EBITDA outlook for the impact of Speedpay. So we’re increasing our targeted EBITDA range to $425 million to $445 million, up from our prior expectation of $335 million to $350 million. Finally, we expect to generate between $280 million and $290 million of revenue in the second quarter. And note that this range does not include the impact of carryover deals from 2018. We expect most likely timing of these in Q3. But if they do sign in Q2, it will be upside of this range. And to help with your modeling, you’ll find additional guidance assumptions on Slide 9. I don’t plan to review those in detail, but notice they’ve all been updated for the impact of Speedpay. And lastly, as a reminder of the acquisition of Speedpay was structured as an asset purchase for U.S. tax purposes pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) election. As a result, ACI will be able to amortize any goodwill and intangibles associated with the acquisition, which we estimate the net present value of this tax benefit to be approximately $100 million. So that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. George, you’re now live.
George Sutton: Thank you. Congrats on getting the Speedpay acquisition closed. Honestly, don’t remember such an attractive acquisition. I wanted to focus, if I could, on the slide that you had on Page 5 – or the chart you had on Page 5 relative to the Bill Pay market, and the portions that you’re going to begin to focus on. Just to be clear, you’re talking about those upper two areas of opportunity, which are the faster-growing parts of the market. And aren’t those completely new to you with this acquisition?
Scott Behrens: Yes. No, I mean ultimately, the digital subscription services and the digital subscription on physical goods will both be – that – those are areas where we will be able to expand additional R&D resources. Remember, we’re combining two sets of R&D spend, and on top of that, we’re actually investing more in R&D to be able to go and tackle and build out capabilities for some of these higher-growth Bill Payments markets.
Phil Heasley: So, George, it’s great question because what this does is – subscription is a wonderful example of explaining what the UP strategy is all about. So PAY.ON’s ability to have this diverse global network of endpoint, our real-time business intelligence broad capabilities and the ability to sit behind the corporate or the – so now they have the ability – it’s not Bill Pay kind of in the traditional way where people think about it. It’s in effect, providing the set of rails both to endpoint – both to the endpoint and to the intermediate tests that have to take place. And if the form of subscription has a low unit cost or something, it cannot afford to be an interchange kind of payment or whatever. Or if immediate payments really start taking off as a push credit and whatnot, it provides another channel for people to – and a lot of the merchant acquirers are beginning to see this need. And we’re actually having more conversations with merchant acquirers and corporations about this than we’re having with banks with our more traditional banking segment. In a way, it makes sense because a lot of these alternate payments are – don’t come from the bank – directly from the banking community or they’re coming in from overseas.
George Sutton: Understand. Obviously, a lot of things driving the business right now. So Scott, can you just give us the composition of Speedpay in the Q2 numbers that you discussed, the $280 million to $290 million. And I’m asking that really to get a better sense of the progress you’ve seen thus far in Q2?
Scott Behrens: Yes. When we closed today, so we’ll be picking up their financial results effective today going forward. I would really prorate what we’re putting out for the full year, just take it pretty equally between today and the end of the year. Their – the Speedpay business’s portfolio is not as lumpy as in some cases ours. Our biller business has a certain bit of seasonality in it because of the heavy portion is in government tax payments. So Q2 on our side can be – actually can be one of the higher quarter of the year. But this portfolio with Speedpay is actually pretty normalized throughout the year. So I take our total just spreaded over the rest of the year.
George Sutton: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Brett, you’re now live.
Brett Huff: Good morning and congrats on getting the deal done. Also echo, it seems like a really nice deal. Two questions for me. Number one, can you give us more detail on sort of the tenure and the timing of bookings? I know we – the renewals – there’s a couple of big renewals that got pushed from 4Q, I think, but as you mentioned, from sort of capital markets activity. Sounds like that’s still supposed to – those are expected to close in the 3Q, but the bookings this quarter were a little lighter than we expected. I know there’s – those can naturally be lumpy, but just wanted to get some insight into that? How’s the pipeline looking? Do we kind of – can you just give us some color on kind of how we get to the high single or low double-digit growth for the year?
Scott Behrens: Yes. I would say that you got a pick a couple of dynamics. Number one, again, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that if you look at it from a comp perspective, Q1 of last year was a record Q1 quarter for us. So certainly, on a comp basis. I think this year will look more traditional in terms of the timing of our bookings with a lot of it sitting out there in Q3 and Q4. So – and I think it just – there’s a natural get-back a little bit after coming off the year where we had over 20% growth in new bookings to have a little bit of slowdown here in the first quarter. But the pipeline is strong and so we’re comfortable with that high single to low double digits for the full year.
Brett Huff: Okay. Great. And my second is, so I think you mentioned combining platforms between your existing Bill Pay business and Speedpay’s. Can you give us a more sense on that? Is it – whose platform is going to remain or is it going to be kind of best of both? And what’s the timing of that? And how do we think about any financial benefits? Is that included in the guidance you’ve given or is that on top of?
Phil Heasley: That’s a great question. Actually, it’s kind of a great marriage. Western Union Speedpay has done a lot of very good work on the front end of their system – of their product, which is they’re calling Next Gen. And they really included their customer base and the marketplace in terms of what Next Gen should look like and whatnot. And we are going to embrace the vast majority of what Next Gen has to offer. We have things like our student portal that we mentioned today. So we have more vertically specific pieces but as – there’d be one overarching UI that will be specific to the individual verticals in terms of what they need and what not. But a good piece of encompassing technology that we’re – it’s going to take us – this – the first round of this is being implemented throughout the entire Speedpay population and there is Phase 2, Phase 3, there’s going to be fair amount of work. We’ve been doing exactly the opposite, and we’ve been building a powerful back-end of the system, and Speedpay has not been working on that piece. That’s also a multiyear effort and all of the expenses are modeled into the guidance and whatnot that we gave in terms of – so the upside of that is that it could change our growth rate once this functionality becomes clear road map to the prospective customers. One of the things you got to think about, Brett, you watch the Uber and you watch the Lyft, you watch these guys. These guys are saying, oh gee, how are we going to get past the profitability and everyone’s kind of scratching their head. At 5% to 6% cost of sales, right, that’s really expensive, we think that we are sitting in a sweet spot, right, in terms of if we get people depend on your form of payment, if we can get them to a much more efficient cost of sales, as all these different subscription-based guys or guys, in effect, where you’ve already preset how you’re going to pay, they may have to go into models that say, you pay one way, it costs you one thing for Uber, you pay another way, it costs you another thing. We think that this creates a real solution that, right, for some of these syntax that are coming out that difference between not having the game plan to profitability and profitability could largely be impacted by what they’re currently spending for the cost of sales.
Brett Huff: That’s helpful. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Eller from Wells Fargo. David, you’re now live.
David Eller: Hey, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Could you talk – start by talking about any financials on the Walletron acquisition. So couple of questions there. Was that a cash acquisition? And then you already had a partnership sitting there. So will there be additional revenue from that? Or will that be netted against anything?
Scott Behrens: Yes. You haven’t disclosed what the financials are from Walletron. For Walletron came to us as a part of the Speedpay acquisition.
David Eller: Okay. So that is – that’s included in the price? Or you’re saying that’s a separate deal?
Scott Behrens: It’s going to be included in the ultimate purchase price for Speedpay.
David Eller: Got it. And then I know historically, you’ve had a focus kind of on the larger number of smaller billers and Speedpay has had much larger focus on a smaller set of larger billers. So can you talk about any of your initial conversations with some of the larger clients on the Speedpay side? So any pushback from accounts either on pricing concessions or anything like that? Or whether they plan to stay or go?
Phil Heasley: We had one of the preeminent consulting companies operate which we call a white room for us, right, because we’re not allowed to interfere with their business until we’re closed. But one of contractual agreements we went through was that we wanted to perform very heavy interaction between ourselves and the customer base and whatnot, and the feedback has been positive and has been good. And we are not changing Speedpay’s business model. As a matter of fact, we’re embracing their mortal as it relates to significant – these significant relationships and whatnot. And having said that, we actually believe that there’s a backflow value. We have some very, very, very large Bill Pay customers. And we believe that their model is going to be very helpful in terms of us even improving our large customer model. So in effect, we’re going to embrace their customer-centric method of dealing with their larger customers. So the answer is, yes, we have been in contact.
David Eller: Got it. And then talking a little bit about your underlying existing OnDemand business. It’s been a time since we’ve been waiting for – to see that kind of big step change in the number of wins and volume there. So can you talk about any progress you’re seeing in accelerating demand towards maybe that high-single-digit growth range?
Scott Behrens: I think you’re starting to see it in the results. Q1 year-over-year growth with 5% margin expansion is 600 basis points. I think what you’ll see obviously, starting in Q2 going forward, is layering on significant amount of EBITDA on top of that cost structure. So you’re going to see a very different profitability profile going forward. But we expect the OnDemand business to come in probably closer to our higher end of the revenue growth expectations for the year. So we’re talking upper single digits on the OnDemand side for the year.
David Eller: That’s great. And then last question for me. Just on the large capital markets deals that have pushed, do you have any additional color there in terms of conversations you’ve had with those respective parties about continuing service with ACI? And just the level of confidence that you will continue to have that business after close?
Phil Heasley: Well, the only way I can answer that is that we’ve had no discussions with any of these customers about discontinuing offer – things – and as we went through the wins today, and I cannot discuss any individual accounts but as we go through the wins, you can see that we’re clearly increasing business with some of the affected parties.
David Eller: Got it. Thank you for taking the questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson. Peter, you’re line is now open.
Peter Heckmann: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to just review, if you could, a little bit more detail, some of the major milestones we should be thinking about for the integration of Speedpay as we go over the next four quarters? And then as well that $35 million is significant transaction cost, how that may go through the year? I assume a big chunk of that will be in the second quarter but how do you envision it in the back half?
Scott Behrens: Yes. We’re going to be operating under TSA in terms of the operations. I don’t know necessarily, if there – I would say there’s key – we obviously have milestones, but I don’t think from a market-facing perspective. The point is that we made that transition from Speedpay to us as smoothly as possible. So as it relates to that, we’ll be operating under TSA as we migrate those customers from their data centers to our data centers, and so that’s going to take time and it will take the amount of time it takes to not be disruptive to the customer base.
Phil Heasley: Yes. One thing I would add to that is we’re not doing any maths conversions. We’re moving these customers one by one around their specific needs. It’s one of the reasons that we put the energy into the TSA that we did.
Scott Behrens: Yes. And then in terms of the one-times, yes, Q2 will be heavy. Obviously, a lot of the professional fees associated with the transaction this year in Q2 and then the phasing I think then for the rest should be very consistent in Q3 and Q4.
Peter Heckmann: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, there are no further questions on queue. Presenters, you may continue.
John Kraft: Well, thanks, everybody, for dialing in, and we look forward to catching up in the coming weeks. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today’s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.";[-0.11263410405143337, -0.01900104797275881];-0.01900104797275881;-0.11263410405143337;0
9;ACIW;2019-08-11;"Operator: Good morning. My name is Tom, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ACI Worldwide Reports Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.I would now like to turn the conference over to John Kraft. Sir, please go ahead.
John Kraft: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everybody. Today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC.On this morning's call is Phil Heasley, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. Before we begin, though, I'd like to let everybody know that ACI will be attending the 2019 Wells Fargo Technology Services Forum in Newport, Rhode Island on August 13 as well as the Craig-Hallum's FinTech Innovators Conference in New York City on September 4 as well as the D.A. Davidson 18th Annual Technology Conference also in New York on September 4.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Phil.
Phil Heasley: Thank you, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. I'm pleased to report that Q2 was a strong quarter for ACI. As the digital transformation of payments accelerates rapidly around the globe, ACI's vision of Any Payment, Every Possibility, is resonating with the market. Our solutions continue to drive customer innovation and success. And as a result, we grew our business organically across our two P&Ls, four customer segments and six solution areas. In the first quarter, as part of ACI, Speedpay further propelled our results, bringing notable improvements in profitability and scale to our ACI On Demand platform business.I'm going to spend the next few minutes providing additional commentary on the quarter, and will share a sample of the Q2 wins that demonstrate ACI's momentum across the key bank, intermediary, merchant and corporate customer segments. I will then turn the call over to Scott to cover the details of our Q2 financial results.I'll start with our ACI On Demand business. This quarter, ACI On Demand grew revenues and profitabilities year-over-year, driven in particular by the increased demand for secure and reliable e-commerce and digital bill payment solutions among merchant and corporate customers. In Q2, ACI On Demand achieved 8% revenue growth year-over-year before the contribution from Speedpay.In early May, we completed the acquisition of Speedpay, bringing together the industry's market-leading U.S. bill payment portfolios. The acquisition brought immediate scale to our platform and has accelerated ACI On Demand's path to achieve our Rule of 40's profitability target. ACI On Demand net adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 18% from a minus 5% in Q2 last year.I'm extremely pleased by the progress we achieved integrating Speedpay and UP Bill Payment businesses during the first 90 days. Our teams are already working successfully as part of the One ACI family, bringing the best of both organizations together in a way that multiplies our power. We've accelerated our plans to deliver a unified bill payment platform capable of supporting billions of transactions. In the case of ACI and Speedpay, 1 and 1 really does equal 3.In Q2, we continued to advance our bill payment portfolio and market leadership with the launch of 2 new capabilities, ACI disbursement services and a new wallet, mobile wallet payment and notification capability for both Apple and Google Pay capabilities. We're also developing real-time recurring digital subscription payment capabilities to meet the converging needs of merchant, corporate and billers.Momentum continues with strong customer wins, expansions and renewals in our corporate segment for our biller solutions, including the State of Georgia, a long-term ACI Bill Pay customer, expanded its relationship with ACI to bring on additional state counties, utilizing web tag renewals. The California State government, a long-term ACI Bill Pay customer, signed a renewal to consolidate term extensions for multiple state departments, municipalities and agencies. New England-based Nichols College selected ACI's Bill Payment solution to improve its students' bill pay experience. And KW Specialty Insurance, a leading full-service insurance company, selected ACI to provide its customers a fast and efficient digital bill pay experience. KW will utilize ACI's new disbursement services, which allows businesses to send money to consumers' bank account in real time using their debit card.Within ACI On Demand, we also continue to see strong momentum for our ecommerce and omnichannel platform solutions. Earlier in the quarter, we announced an alliance with JCB International to launch its JCB web API service, which is powered by our UP eCommerce payment solution. The JCB web API service makes it easier and faster for acquirers to connect the JCB network to accept transactions for more than 130 million JCB card members.Other key milestones, wins and renewals in the merchant segment in quarter 2 include one of the largest office supply retailers in the United States, which selected UP Merchant Payments to manage its payments infrastructure. Orangepay, a leading Dutch-based PSP with merchant customers across Europe and China, selected UP Merchant Payments to process its online payments.KingPay, a leading global fintech, selected UP Merchant Payments as it expands its merchant acquirer business and works to control online payment fraud and reduce charge-backs. IPS, a leading qualified service provider in China as well as a central hub for Visa and Mastercard cross-border transactions, selected UP Merchant Payments. IPS is working to become China's leading provider of cross-border transactions for Visa and Mastercard. One of the largest mobile network operators in the U.K. and a long-term ACI customer is utilizing UP eCommerce payment solution for online fraud prevention.Shifting now to our On Premise business. The ACI On Premise P&L had a strong quarter, growing revenue and EBITDA year-over-year, driven by digital transformation, open banking and new real-time payment regulations. Demand for our UP Real-Time Payments capabilities particularly grew significantly, up 40% from quarter two 2018. Showcasing our customer momentum, ACI was recognized as the best real time payments solution provider at the Ovum payment innovation awards.In addition, we announced that Venmo, a financial group is leveraging our UP real time payment solutions to accelerate new products to markets such as Zelle's business to consumer payments. Real time payments continue to take hold across the globe. This week's news from the Federal Reserve announcing plans to build a real time payment network in the U.S. validates the growing opportunity. ACI already supports the two current U.S. real-time networks, Zelle and The Clearing House, and is also powering real time payments around the world, in Australia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Europe and the Middle East.We've now extended our real time payment reach to India. In Q2, we made a strategic investment in Mumbai based Mindgate Solutions. India's leading digital payments solution provider as well as market leader in processing Unified Payment Interface or UPI. These are real time transactions. 70% of UPI's transactions are currently routed through Mindgate customer banks. By 2023, industry experts predict that there will be more than 60 billion UPI transactions annually, counting more than 50% of India's digital payment transaction.As part of this investment, ACI and Mindgate will deliver a joint real time payment solutions that will combine ACI's proven universal payments processing software with Mindgate's digital overlay services. This will build on ACI's strong heritage and presence in India's payment ecosystem. Eight of the country's ten largest banks currently utilize ACI's UP solutions to process 60% of India's digital payment transactions.In addition, with our global reach, we plan to bring Mindgate's capabilities to a number of international markets in addition to India. In June, I had the honor of hosting a payments forum with India's leading bank executives in Mumbai. I am very excited by the innovation occurring in the country, which is on a path to outpace other regions and transfer its economy with digital payments. Key ACI On Premise's wins, expansions, renewals across our bank and intermediate segments include State Bank of India, the largest bank in India, and the long term ACI customer, which utilizes UP retail payments and UP payments risk management to meet its card and non-card based transaction processing and fraud monitoring requirements.Wells Fargo, one of the world's largest banks and long term ACI customer is utilizing Universal Online Banker for ACH payments. Cardtronics, the world's largest ATM operator and long term ACI customer is utilizing UP retail payments as it expands into markets and segments. Dashen, a long term ACI customer in Ethiopia is utilizing UP retail payments and UP payments risk management as it expands its leadership position within the country. Currency Select, which enables partners in 21 countries to perform dynamic currency conversion and multi currency processing selected UP retail payments to revamp its existing acquiring business functions.And to improve its operational effectiveness; Artajasa, a leading Indonesian-based interbank network, selected UP Retail Payments to quickly introduce new payment channels and payment types to its customers; Banred, the largest processor in Uruguay, selected UP Retail Payments to consolidate many of its payment systems into a single innovative platform; Dollar Bank, a leading regional bank based in Northeastern United States and long-term ACI customer, renewed with Universal Online Banker and will upgrade our platform solution to offer a revamped user experience and deliver seamless desktop and mobile to its business customers.Before I hand it off to Scott, I want to highlight and congratulate some exceptional organizations that are driving innovation in payments. Last month, we hosted our annual ACI Exchange customer event and celebrated the best of the best in payments.We presented ACI Innovation Awards to ANZ New Zealand, New Zealand's largest financial services group; Avant, a leading online lending platform for customers; ING, a Dutch multinational banking and financial services corporation; PayNet, the national payment network and central infrastructure provider for Malaysia; and Universal Studios, the theme park and entertainment powerhouse.We are proud to be fueling their innovation and honored by our customers' ongoing trust and partnership. It's customers like these that are making Any Payment, Every Possibility happen around the globe and accelerating the digital global economy.In closing, I want to reiterate that ACI is well positioned for continued growth in 2019 and beyond. With strong new bookings pipeline and the strategic acquisition of Speedpay, ACI is poised to capitalize even more quickly on the growing number of payment transactions occurring around the world each day. We are on track financially for the year, and we're reiterating our guidance for 2019.I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide additional financial details. Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Okay. Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of the second quarter and then provide our outlook for the second half and full year. We'll then open the line for questions.I'll be starting my comments on Slide 6 with key takeaways in the quarter. Most notably in the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Speedpay, and our integration efforts are on track. Our reported results for the quarter include the contribution of Speedpay from May 9 to June 30. The results for Speedpay came in as expected, contributing revenue and EBITDA of $49 million and $12 million, respectively. Speedpay also contributed to our growth in backlog, adding $311 million to our 12-month backlog and $1.5 billion to our 60-month backlog.For the rest of my comments here, I'll be discussing our results on an organic constant currency basis, so excluding the contribution of Speedpay. Starting with bookings. Total bookings were $301 million, up 57% versus Q2 last year. And new bookings were $129 million, up 4% from Q2 last year. We ended the quarter with 12-month backlog of $1.1 billion, up $16 million during the quarter and 60-month backlog of $5.7 billion, up $29 million during the quarter.Q2 revenue grew 8% over last year and came in above our guidance and expectations. And most notably, recurring revenue now represents 75% of total revenue. Our solid revenue growth contributed to strong EBITDA growth, which was up 41% over last year.Turning next to our 2 operating segments. Our On Demand business saw revenue growth of 9% over Q2 last year and continues to show solid margin improvement, delivering net adjusted EBITDA margins of 7% in Q2 this year compared to a negative 5% in Q2 last year. And combined with Speedpay margins, our On Demand segment delivered 18% net EBITDA margins in the quarter. So as we've been saying for some time now, margin improvement will come with scale as we grow into the infrastructure that we've built out over the last few years.Our On Premise segment grew 6% and delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of 46% versus 45% last year. Adjusted operating free cash flow was $16 million, up from $13 million in Q2 last year. We ended Q2 with $139 million cash, down from $176 million at the end of Q1. During the quarter, we used our cash and free cash flow to pay transaction and financing fees as well as onetime integration expenses related to the close of Speedpay and to pay down our debt. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in debt and a pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.7x.And lastly, here, we have $176 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. One other note here before turning to our outlook. We don't spend a lot of time discussing items below EBITDA, but this quarter, we did recognize a sizable tax benefit. The addition of Speedpay's U.S.-based income has allowed us to reassess our ability to utilize certain foreign tax credits that we had previously reserved.So modeling in our projected U.S. earnings from Speedpay, we now expect to be able to utilize those tax credits before they expire. So we've recognized the tax benefit in the quarter of $18 million. Ultimately, this will be realized by lower cash taxes in the future as we apply those credits to future U.S. earnings. And it's important to note that this benefit is in addition to the previously disclosed tax benefit that we'll realize from the 338(h)(10) election for the acquisition of Speedpay.Turning next to Slide 7 with our guidance. We remain on track for delivering our financial guidance for the year. As a reminder, we expect 2019 total revenue to be in a range of $1.315 billion to $1.345 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $360 million to $380 million, which excludes between $30 million and $35 million in onetime transaction and integrated-related expenses. We continue to expect new bookings growth to be in the upper-single to low-double digits.Operating free cash flow is expected to be in a range of $190 million to $200 million. And we're also reiterating our 2020 EBITDA outlook, which is expected to be in a range of $425 million to $445 million.And finally, we expect to generate between $335 million and $345 million of revenue in the third quarter. And note that this range does not include the impact of carryover deals from Q4 2018. We still expect those most likely timing of these deals in Q3, and we believe we're very close to completion on those. However, these deals are not included in our Q3 forecast and would be upside to this guidance range.So that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to open the line to questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
George Sutton: Thank you. Nice results, guys. So I wondered if you could give us an update on the large M&A related deals that had pushed from prior quarters and seem to be big opportunities for you. Did any of those close in the quarter?
Scott Behrens: George, this is Scott. Yes, as I mentioned, in terms of our Q3 guidance range, they did not close in Q2 and the Q3 guidance range that we put out there does not have them included. But, we are in what I call late stages on those and so if those close here in Q3, which we continue to expect them to, they would be upside to what we've guided to.
George Sutton: Superb. Relative to your on demand margins, which improved very nicely, do you view that as an inflection that we have achieved and is that now going forward, just going to be a continued area of margin expansion?
Scott Behrens: Well, the short answer is yes. I mean, I think the inflection really started even if you go back to last year where we flipped positive and in terms of EBITDA margins for the first time and we're continuing even on an organic basis to show the power and scale of that, the AOD business, meaning just layering on the organic revenue alone was driving margin expansion. The addition of the incremental SpeedPay EBITDA on top of that is allowing us kind of a step up in our trajectory in our path toward the our Rule of 40 targets for AOD. So, yes, I think we had that inflection point last year. It's more noticeable this year with the layer on of SpeedPay.
George Sutton: Got it. Great results. Thanks, guys.
Scott Behrens: Thanks George.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Eller from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
David Eller: Hey, good morning, Phil. I think in the script you talked about maybe accelerating some of the SpeedPay integration plans. So could you talk about any changes in plan and any milestones or timeline you have planned for, that we can be looking to?
Phil Heasley: In terms of bringing the businesses together, well, we've been working on a multi-year project to build a state-of-the-art back end system. Western Union had embarked on a front end, they call it NextGen system. So, as we've really gotten under the covers and looked at it in great detail, we found that there is more leverage coming from the synergy than we originally thought. And we're going ahead on a, on some additional adds such as subscription billing, and we've already implemented the educational, the portal and whatnot.So, we're feeling confident that it's still going to be a year and a half, two years before we start seeing major improvements and it's going to be three years before, three plus years before we're totally done. But we see the, we see our results improving. We're getting more critical mass, not less critical mass. It's a big project, but it's going to a one of a kind platform once it's done.
David Eller: Great. And then, Scott, back to the SpeedPay, I was kind of having a little trouble reconciling the organic versus reported numbers. So was SpeedPay dilutive to the On Demand segment in Q2? Am I calculating that right? So like what was the, I guess, the organic change in EBITDA?
Scott Behrens: Yes. So the organic change in the if you're looking at specifically the AOD segment went from a negative 5% EBITDA margin last year to a plus 7% EBITDA margin this year. Then you layer on the Speedpay EBITDA. And again, Speedpay delivered for the subperiod, less than two months, they delivered $49 million of revenue and $12 million of EBITDA. That drove the EBITDA margin up to 18%. So both on an organic basis as well as with EBITDA, they're both accretive year-over-year.
David Eller: Okay. Yes. Got it. That's super helpful. That clears that up. And then last question from me on the you talked about some of the tax effects that were more beneficial after the close. What could that look like on an annual basis? I know previously, you talked about cash taxes this year of $40 million. So what sort of reduction would you expect either for this year or going forward?
Scott Behrens: Well, a lot of the cash taxes that we're paying right now are in our international operations. Historically, we had acquired a lot of NOLs that have made our U.S. federal cash tax pretty low, and that's going to continue. And that's going to continue for 2 reasons. One, the 338(h)(10) election on the acquisition of Speedpay is going to give us a substantial tax deduction of almost probably $700 million.Now that stretches out over time, but that will be a deduction against taxable earnings going forward and will impact U.S. cash taxes. But also, the point I've made on the foreign tax credits. We had reserved this $18 million because we felt that they wouldn't be able to be utilized before they expire. And by adding in the projections that Speedpay gives us in its predominantly U.S. earnings, we're going to be able to utilize those foreign tax credits before they expire.So that was the benefit that I mentioned in my scripted comments. But yes, it'll be a number of years before we are really paying anything of significance in terms of U.S. cash taxes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: It seems as though there have been several deals in billing as well as B2B payments over the last, let's say, four to six months. Have any of those deals, in your view, changed some of the competitive dynamics? Or do you continue to feel that the combination of ACI and Speedpay has the formula to be a long-term leader in the bill pay space?
Phil Heasley: Well, a lot of the acquisitions that have been made, there's been some very big horizontal acquisitions. And they've largely been either between customers of ours and customers of ours or customers of ours and near competitors of ours. And that doesn't really make a certainly doesn't make an immediate change. A lot of the pressures that they are dealing with have to do with real-time payments and alternate payment methods that you really need a broader array array than front-ending traditional association kinds of payments.There have been some other more innovative payments that have taken place that also are recognizing the growth of non-traditional and certainly immediate payments and whatnot. And I would say that some of those are competitive in that they're going to go after opportunities that we're going to go after. But our growth, the 40% -- you're getting -- we haven't even gotten into the point where the real growth rates of immediate payments are hitting, right?So there's a lot of room, and I think you're going to see a lot of activity in that category. And I worry less about the horizontal mergers that take place than other people who are rethinking, reshaping. The good news is that we sit at the center, we sit at the apex, of where this change is taking place. We don't have the scale to compete against some of those guys, but we certainly have the current share and the current capabilities to effect the change. So we feel really comfortable in terms of our position, but we have immense respect for the sized players that are entering the space.
Peter Heckmann: And then just on -- you mentioned a little add-on, I think, at Wells Fargo for Universal Online Banker, some of the functionality. But as regards to that product within commercial or corporate digital banking, do you feel like we're past some of the attrition that we had seen from the legacy platform? And do you think within the next year or so we should see your digital banking on a net basis contributing to growth rates?
Phil Heasley: Yes. I think you should. Now one thing that we did not broadcast, but being it's now completely behind us, we can tell you, is we never had any intention of staying in the consumer online business. And we have now attrited through not renewing, right? We've now attrited 100% of that, right? So we've eliminated that category from our repertory of products. So it's attrition. We can't get anymore attrition there because we're out of that business. And we really -- that was a planned exit. That was not an unplanned exit.And by all accounts, our other product is a very, very high quality -- is a very high-quality product. I think you saw today that Dollar -- there was a company -- there's 2 or 3 guys that are long-term customers that are going from older technology to the newer technology, the new platform. We are not -- also, we're also not a supporter of on-premise, except from a product standpoint.Like we'll supply ACH capability to Bank of America or Wells Fargo or whoever, but we will not give them a generic online banking system because that's key to their branding and everything else. What we do is we offer platforms for those sized banks that want a high-quality corporate interface or we provide functionalities to big players that need our payments skill set versus our digital skill set in terms of the offering. So yes, we've kind of crossed the Rubicon in terms of working our way out of acquired assets that we didn't want to continue.
Peter Heckmann: Great. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens, Incorporated. Your line is open.
Brett Huff: Good morning, Phil, Scott and John. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Phil Heasley: Thanks Brett.
Brett Huff: A follow up question on SpeedPay. I'm not sure for Phil or Scott, but my understanding is that SpeedPay had trended a little bit bigger in terms of customers for the bill pay solution. And wondering how the initial visits are going with some of those big customers. I suspect that SpeedPay probably wasn't as well, didn't have as many resources at its former home as it does now in terms of resources and focus. So wondering if bringing more of that to bear and speaking with those customers, you know, as there are likely renewals, were there any customers we are worried about, we feel better about renewing in the future, etc?
Phil Heasley: We've put an extensive amount of energy into making it clear that this is a clear and important and heavily invested focus of ours and what not. And we've had some very good conversations. You know, any time you go through something like this, you find out five or 15 things that you can do to make your customer happy, that, you know, not that they weren't being well treated, but actually, the SpeedPay, the people that oversaw the accounts really did a fantastic job. They didn't have our resources in the category, but they really did a fantastic job. But we actually had hired as good consultants as you can get to manage the interface with the customers during the entire quiet period and what not.So we were able to get off of that running and really reshape our roadmap in terms of addressing the needs of some of these customers. And, you know, we have some very large customers, yes, a lot of those large customers are more conglomerate oriented. So they're both large customers, but they're something we're very used to dealing with in terms of our big customers around the world.So there's both the, there's the corporate relationship, plus there's the more localized business relationship that has to take place. I think the team, the SpeedPay team, the now One ACI team, I think they've done a really good job in terms that the cross-sell, now Walletron, we don't talk a lot about Walletron and what not. But the applicability of wallet and alternate and you know, as real time payments work their way into bill pay, our customers are smart, they're big, intelligent companies.They see the benefit in terms of, you know, not necessarily more of the same business, but more different ways of making real time payments, making their customer payments take place, be it a real timer or alternate or, or just an easier and easier process and the educational portal is a good example of that because it's really addressing ways for our customer to better engage with their customer, which is actually the student and student's families. So, we're looking at a lot of things across the board that way and having very good conversations.
Brett Huff: Thanks. And my follow up is on the faster payments evolution, things seem to be heating up both via M&A by the big two networks. Some partnerships they've started to strike, etc. And then a recent announcement of a big European purchase. Does that, I'm sure that that makes faster payments higher in everybody's mind, which is I think is a positive for everybody in the market, probably including you.But does that how does that change the -- on the ground trying to win deals either at the country's switch level or at the helping banks connect to the country switch level? How does it, how does the kind of feet on the ground change the competitive dynamic, if at all?
Phil Heasley: Well, I would these guys, you know, I have nothing. I think, you know, my history. I certainly understand these guys awfully well, I have immense respect for them and what not. Right now what it's doing is that they're increasing the current and therefore the speed of the stream, you know, if you think about this as a river, we're paddling like mad, you know, everyone is saying oh, anything but immediate payments. And they're, we're really we're kind of really kind of paddling uphill.Suddenly, the big guys come in and say, well, gee, you know, we think it makes sense. Well, step number one is that's going to accelerate our boat down the downstream. Now, that being said, we understand that, these guys are 70 times our size or, you know, whatever you know.So, you know, we're playing with we're playing with giants in terms of that. So I wouldn't get cocky, right. And I wouldn't get into a pricing war with one of these, you know, with one of these guys. I can't win, right. But right now, there's plenty of space and quite honestly, I think we have we're from a connectivity standpoint we're in fantastic shape.We have got the right we've got the right connectivity to the right banks and what not. We've been giving the banks the technology, right, in terms of renewing, we've been giving them the old and the new technology. This is a perfect use case for the new technology.You heard things I've been talking about BMO and some of these other places that we're talking about how they're utilizing and what not. That's wind behind our back, but it's also an increase in the current where we don't have, you know, where we don't have the strength and we don't play is in the ability to actually move the money in the canoe - just the pure scale that these are the guys.So we have to respect where -- we never were a big scale player and we don't we can't suddenly get cocky and think we are a big scale player. I think Mindgate is a perfect example where we had two thirds of the debit share in the market, but it was basically a debit card, therefore not a large portion of the actual trends of India, right. India goes in, revitalizes, reinvents themselves. We get ourselves into two-thirds of the volume of the immediate payments by investing and partnering with Mindgate. So those kinds of moves, you know.So if the big guys come in and they accelerate immediate payments, that's for the foreseeable short term that's three, five years, that's good for us, right. Longer term, you know where we're going to they're $300 billion or $400 billion in market size, and we're $4 billion in market size, we've got to respect who we actually are, right.So not as bad situation, Brett, I mean, you know, you got to be sober, but it's a nice situation that we're in. And we've been investing for decades for this moment to happen. And we've, you and I have had a lot of conversations over the years about whether it was even going to happen, right. So the fact that it's happening, I think is fantastic. Different kinds of opportunities and different kinds of risk come with it.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to our presenters for any further comments.
John Kraft: Well, thanks, everybody, for your time. We look forward to catching up in the coming weeks. Have a good day.

10;ACIW;2019-11-10;"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the ACI Worldwide Q3 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. John Kraft. Please go ahead sir.
John Kraft: Thank you, Patricia. Good morning, everybody. Today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on our website as well as with the SEC.On this morning's call is our CEO, Phil Heasley; our CFO, Scott Behrens; and we also have Craig Saks our COO. Before we begin, I'd like to let everybody know that ACI will be attending Citi's 2019 Financial Technology Conference in New York next Tuesday and Wednesday, November 12 and 13.We will also be attending Stephens 2019 Nashville Investment Conference in Nashville next Thursday November 14. In addition, we will be hosting our own ACI Analyst Days, both in New York and in London on Tuesday, November 19 and Thursday, November 21.With that, I'd like to turn it over to Phil.
Phil Heasley: Yes. Thank you, John, and thank you everyone for joining today's call. I'm pleased to report that quarter three was a strong quarter for ACI. As the digital transformation of payments accelerates around the globe, ACI's vision of Any Payment, Every Possibility continues to resonate with the market. We are growing our business organically across our two P&Ls. The acquisition of Speedpay which closed in May further propelled our results, bringing notable improvement in profitability and scale to our ACI On Demand platform.In addition, one of our delayed contracts from 2018 closed in quarter three with a major renewal and expansion, validating ACI's important role in the new payments ecosystem. We fully expect another one of these deals to close in the fourth quarter.Also notable in the quarter, we have partnered with Microsoft and secured two significant acquirer clients running retail payments solution in the cloud on Azure, following the successful proof of concepts. One client will go live next week and the other will follow shortly. In addition, our development of Sandbox and Azure is also gaining traction, as a way for our customers to build and test new solutions via our APIs.As John mentioned, Craig Saks, ACI's Chief Operating Officer is also with us today and I'm going to have him spend the next few minutes providing additional commentary on the quarter and sharing a sampling of Q3 wins, which demonstrates ACI's momentum within our bank, intermediary, merchant and corporate customer segments. Craig will then turn over the call to Scott to cover the details of our Q3 financials. Craig?
Craig Saks: Thank you very much, Phil, and good morning, everyone. So I'll start with our ACI On Demand business. As Phil mentioned, we continued to grow organically and then layered on the Speedpay acquisition which has brought improved scale and profitability to our platform.In Q3, 2019, revenue for the ACI On Demand P&L was $193 million, up 85% from last year and our net adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 20% from 5% in Q3 of last year. We're also pleased to report that our Speedpay integration efforts are nicely on track to bring together the industry's leading U.S. bill pay portfolios into a single unified bill pay platform capable of supporting billions of transactions. We're also broadening the reach of ACI's Speedpay mobiles mobile wallet technology, which just received top honors from the Aite Group in its Digital Wallet Innovation Awards program.Our solid bill pay foundation is fueling investment in higher growth opportunities for our platform, which includes secure e-commerce and machine learning-based payments intelligence solutions. In addition, we are developing real-time and recurring digital subscription payment capabilities to meet the converging needs of merchants, corporates and billers.A brief sampling of a few ACI On Demand Q3 wins would include; the peer group of insurance companies, a leading U.S. home and auto insurer, who selected ACI Speedpay to expand bill pay options for its commercial portfolio. Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey has expanded its use of ACI's bill payment solutions and Idaho Housing and Finance Association, a leading regional mortgage servicer has selected ACI's bill payments to enhance its self-service channels.On the merchant side of our portfolio, Lime Light CRM, a subscription management platform for e-commerce companies selected UP Merchant Payments to support the online payment needs of its growing customer base. And a leading video game developer and eSports tournament organizer chose UP Merchant Payments as it expands its digital wallet and retail operations.Shifting now to ACI On Premise. This P&L also reported strong quarterly results. In the year-over-year comparison revenues increased 15% and net adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 62% from 55%. This growth was fueled by significant customer contract with a leading global bank technology and payment processor.This contract which had been delayed due to industry M&A activity in Q4, 2018, represents both a renewal and an expansion of ACI's technology. ACI will equip this newly combined organization for aggressive payments, digital transformation and transaction growth through its use of our UP Retail Payments solution, our UP Real-Time Payment solution, our UP Payments Risk Management solution and also our back office solutions.This organization selection of ACI's solutions validates the trend we have been seeing for the last several quarters. Banks, merchants and intermediaries continue to recommit to our foundational UP Retail Payment solution to power their core payments infrastructure while adding UP Real-Time Payments to manage growth in the immediate payments world, as well as UP Payments intelligence to manage increasingly sophisticated payment fraud risks.Finally, as we noted each quarter, real-time payments continued to be at the heart of the innovation agenda for the majority of banks worldwide, and ACI is very much at the forefront of immediate payments deployments around the world.Last quarter you may recall, we announced a strategic investment with Mindgate Solutions in India. In Q3, we advanced our build-out of a joint payment solution that will combine ACI's proven universal payments processing software with Mindgate's excellent portfolio of digital overlay services for UPI transactions in India. I'm very pleased with the way our teams are working together and ACI and Mindgate were featured as co-presenters at Money20/20 just last week in Las Vegas.ACI On Premise wins and major milestones for Q3 would include some of the following. State Bank of India, the largest bank in India, signed a renewal to use UP Retail Payments and UP Payments Risk Management to meet its card and non-card-based transaction processing and fraud monitoring requirements, protecting hundreds of millions of accounts.A leading global financial services firm has expanded its use of UP Payments Risk Management for fraud prevention and detection for its debit cards business. In Europe, Rabobank achieved its final milestone in scaling up for instant payments as part of the Dutch SEPA Instant Payments launch.This provides immediate payment processing of mobile and online payments for consumers, enabling consumers to pay and receive money instantly at any time of the day, 365 days a year. In our Pacific region, Australia's leading provider of integrated financial services selected UP Real-Time Payments to simplify its current platform, address new and future business requirements and reduce time to market.In Latin America, Banco de La República, the largest bank in Uruguay, expanded its use of UP Real-Time Payments and UP Retail Payments to offer its customers innovative products and they get better connect to a growing fin-tech environment.And finally, I'm proud to mention that ACI's technology continues to be recognized for industry awards. Our payments intelligence solution recently won the 2019 Global Banking and Finance Award, where we were honored as the best enterprise fraud prevention provider in Europe for our multi-layered approach to fraud detection and machine learning capabilities. We were also recognized as the best real-time payment solution provider at the Ovum Payment Innovation Awards.Finally, before I hand over to Scott, I want to reiterate that we had a strong quarter across both our ACI On Demand and our ACI On Premise P&Ls. We are pleased to have closed a significant recommitment and strategic expansion contract with one of our delayed contracts from Q4, 2018.This contract validates ACI's important role in the new payments ecosystem and we look forward to ongoing growth with this customer. In addition, we are in the final stages of negotiation and expect to close another significant contract that has been delayed from 2018 due to the industry M&A activity.And with that, I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide additional commentary. Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Okay. Thanks, Craig and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of the third quarter and then provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. I will then hand it back to Phil for some final comments before we open the line for questions.I'll be starting my comments on Slide 6 with key takeaways from the quarter. Overall, we had a strong quarter with new bookings up 12% from last year. Importantly, as Phil and Craig have both mentioned, one of our contracts that was delayed due to customer M&A activity in late 2018, closed in Q3, with a major renewal and expansion validating ACI's important role in the new payment ecosystem. We ended the quarter with 12-month backlog and 60-month backlog of $1.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.Q3 revenue grew 45% over last year and came in above our expectations and at the high end of our guidance range. Excluding the impact of Speedpay, revenue was up a strong 9% organically. Recurring revenue increased to 69% of total revenue, up from 65% of total revenue in Q3 last year. Our solid revenue growth contributed to strong EBITDA growth, which was up 66% -- over last year.Turning next to our two operating segments. Our On Demand segment grew revenue 85%, driven primarily from the Speedpay contribution and continues to deliver solid margin improvement, with our net adjusted EBITDA margins hitting 20% in Q3 this year, compared to 5% last year. As we've been saying for some time now, the margin improvement will come with time and with scale, as we grow the revenue into the infrastructure that we've built out over the last few years.Our On Premise segment grew revenue 15% and delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of 61% versus 55% last year. Cash flow from operating activities was $32 million versus $29 million in Q3 last year. We ended Q3 with $122 million in cash and $1.4 billion in debt. And during the quarter, we spent $35 million repurchasing 1.2 million shares and we have $141 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.Turning next to Slide seven with our outlook. We continue to expect full year 2019 revenue to be in the range of $1.315 billion to $1.345 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $360 million to $380 million, which excludes between $30 million and $35 million in onetime transaction and integration-related expenses. And with seven weeks left in the year, I'd say we're comfortable with where consensus estimates are lining up with our full year revenue and EBITDA expectations.So on a constant currency basis, we saw a mid-teens new bookings growth here in Q3 contributing to double-digit organic revenue growth and expect Q4 new bookings growth and organic revenue growth to be even stronger double-digit growth as we exit the year. So clearly exiting 2019 strong and we expect that momentum to continue into 2020. With that, we're comfortable reiterating our 2020 EBITDA outlook, which is expected to be in a range of $425 million to $445 million and we plan to give more details regarding our 2020 outlook on our Q4 earnings call.With that, I will hand the call back over to Phil for some final comments.
Phil Heasley: Thanks, Scott. Thanks a lot. Before we turn to Q&A portion of today's call, I have a closing comment. This morning I announced that after an incredibly fulfilling 15 years with ACI, I have informed the Board that I plan to retire year-end as President CEO and Member of the Board. The Board has been conducting a thorough search for my successor. I will serve in a consulting capacity for three months, following my retirement to help provide for an orderly succession.Given our strong and experienced management team and the depth of our bench of talent at ACI, I am very confident that this will be a seamless process. I look back on the last 15 years with great pride and satisfaction. We have developed a position as an innovative leader in the complex and involving digital marketplace. We've secured our operating model and we've gained traction among key customer segments. Serving as ACI's CEO has been a great privilege for me. And I look forward to seeing ACI continue to achieve as well as prevail well into the future.With that operator, we are ready to open the line and answer all questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Alexis Huseby: Good morning, gentlemen. This is Alexis on for Pete. Phil, sorry to hear that you'll be leaving us, but congratulations on your retirement.
Phil Heasley: Thank you.
Alexis Huseby: So, with the On Premise deal that closed, could you detail how the contract was expanded?
Phil Heasley: Craig?
Craig Saks: Yes. So, a few things. First of all, they expanded it in terms of the time frame that they've committed. There was an increase in volume that was committed and we actually cross-sold an additional set of applications so they have an end-to-end solution for expansion in some new markets.
Alexis Huseby: Okay. Great. And then switching over to the On Demand segment. What was organic growth in the quarter? And then, any areas you can point to outside of Speedpay that are contributing relatively more to growth within the segment?
Scott Behrens: Yes. On Demand grew low single digits in the quarter. I think, importantly, you saw a lot of the growth year-over-year came from Speedpay, but the key driver there is the continued expansion in profitability last year with 5% EBITDA margins this year with 20% EBITDA margin. So, that's really showing the power of the -- and the scalability of the infrastructure that we've put in place.
Phil Heasley: And the new digital products are growing.
Scott Behrens: Correct.
Alexis Huseby: Great. Okay. And then I'll just squeeze one more in if that's all right. So in the first five or six months now of earnings Speedpay, could you update us on integration efforts some of the focus areas for investment and then also, if you've seen any uptick in any attrition from the Speedpay base? Thanks.
Phil Heasley: Actually, we're very, very proud of the Speedpay integration. It was -- it's a carve-out, which gives it a little bit different flavor, but the -- we brought on a wonderful management team that had a long and dedicated view of the business. They -- I wouldn't say that they were happier, but they were very happy that they joined a company that was so payments-focused. They brought with them a -- I think the customer centricity of that group I think is a positive and they brought some leadership as it relates to that. We have not seen attrition. The accounts are renewing very nicely and we're going through it in -- the relationships are actually in very good order. I mean, the Speedpay is an acquisition that has brought great intrinsic value to us and we feel very good about it. I don't know if you want to add.
Craig Saks: Yes. Only two things I'd add. Great signs of good engagement from the customer base that I'm seeing good cross-sell traction between both sides of the portfolio in fact which is nice for example the mobile's application that I mentioned earlier on is showing up really within the market. And then a number of those renewals that Phil mentioned to you, are actually coming up for renewal this quarter and our customers were signing up for longer terms in some cases, which I would take as a positive affirmation of the confidence in what we're doing here.
Alexis Huseby: That’s great. Thank you for taking our questions.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
George Sutton: Thank you. Phil, I've been around for the whole 15 years and it's been a wild ride, but a great ride. Just for history purposes on a split-adjusted basis, I think when you joined it was a $6 stock. So, it's obviously been lucrative for long-term shareholders. You, as a history buff are I know very focused on your legacy and you have always talked about sort of leaving ACI at the right time and place. I wondered if you could just address that in terms of -- what was the thought process in terms of the timing?
Phil Heasley: Well, I don't think there's any -- I don't think I've ever tried to pretend to be anything, but a transformational manager. I'm one of these guys that is kind of interested in what the world is supposed to look like five or 10 or in this case, 15 years out in the future. And we started this with a bunch of assets that were -- think about this company began 100% dependent on the HP nonstop computer, right? And you look at the companies that we were in there with most of them have lost 40% to 60% of their value over the last 10 years. We've made 20 acquisitions and we've spent R&D money. We've taken our investors, and I thank all the investors many of you've been with us for this whole period.So I want to thank you for my piece of it. We've taken on a roller coaster ride. We're probably our greatest skill set is not making quarters at times and being more value-oriented than 90 days. It's actually not a 90-day business. It's a cool way of managing or measuring this business. But we believed 15 years ago in the digital commerce marketplace and immediate payments and that we were going to go from being hardware-driven to software-driven. And most people thought we were nuts and I am now leaving the company in which there is no debate in the marketplace about what the world is going to look like going forward.And we're right in the middle of the current. I think the expression I've used with you George was unlike Moses, I wanted to make it to the promised land. I wanted to make it from Egypt to Israel and we've made it to Egypt to Israel, but not being a transformational manager. The company really deserves to now pursue scale in go-to-market because we have all the tools and whatnot. And it's great that we announced those two Azure deals and it shows that we are cloud-relevant and we're going to become much, much more cloud-relevant and whatnot.Transformation is not the next chapter. I mean we'll always be transforming, but I forced this company to look inward, to work on acquisitions, to be a little bit less customer-centric at times because we force customers to move along with us in terms of technology changes and whatnot. They maybe will thank me in the second life for that, but they haven't always thanked me at the time.But I think we've done something that's significant. But I think that we only have a fraction of the potential value and that value is going to come from having scale on a go-to-market thing. And that's not my forte. And it is the right time for me to do it. We had a brief conversation in the middle of the year in which I kind of -- I didn't say, but I at least said I was thinking about this point in time. And I do believe it's the right point in time.I only have one constant in my life and that's my very, very, very long-term marriage and my kids. All these other things are event based. And I think this is the right event. And I'm very happy and I'm very confident of the team's ability to keep going what we've developed. That's a long answer but...
George Sutton: Well, given it's been 15 years it's hard to believe I'm still in my 30s, but I had one other question. You are in a rapidly consolidating industry. This company has been on the top of software banker lists of attractive M&A candidates for a long time. Obviously, when you see a change like this that creates incremental interest. A hard question, but I think it's a relevant question and probably one a lot of people on the call are curious about so I thought I'd ask.
Phil Heasley: Yes, but that's about as appropriate as kissing your secretary. So I can't say -- I'm not going to answer that George, right?
George Sutton: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Palmer from BTIG. Your line is open.
Mark Palmer: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to get a little bit more perspective particularly of the signing of the delayed contract. At the same time the company did not raise guidance -- financial guidance for fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2020. Just want to get a sense of is that just a question of getting clarity around the upside associated with that contract? Or is it a timing thing in terms of when it would kick in?
Scott Behrens: Yes. No, we had contemplated these deals. If you recall back at the beginning of the year we had contemplated these as a part of our guidance. So our expectation was when we came out of 2018 this -- and we actually increased our EBITDA guidance at the beginning of this year in reflection of these deals carrying over from 2018. We didn't increase the guidance. They've been contemplated in our full year guidance.
Phil Heasley: We actually made -- we actually had a learning. I won't say we had a mistake. When these four deals -- when the four mergers were announced and it represented eight customers of ours, we knew we had to figure out how to deal with it. We thought that delays and whatnot would be a function of announcement and it's very clear that that was wishful thinking. They were a function of the closing. So as these deals have closed, it's been very predictable in terms of how to rectify.And they've turned out the opportunities and they're going to continue to turn out to be opportunities. And having known that simple little fact that I've just said, we would not have raised our EBITDA guidance at the beginning of the year when it first happened because we thought it was just a brief hiatus. We would have waited to now to raise it and we didn't. It's a learning. I promise you we're not going to do that well they're not going to do that going forward.
Mark Palmer: Okay. And one more question. Just with regard to the timetable with regard to succession what is the thinking in terms of when a new CEO could be named? And how long has the search using an executive recruiter gone on? And what is the thinking about internal versus external candidates? And with that I'll get back in the queue.
Phil Heasley: Yes. Okay. Thank you. But I can answer a part of that. I'm not going to answer all of it, right? The Board has done a rigorous job of thinking through succession and it's been -- it's been a major topic for over two years at the company. And they've been working with these folks at Russell Reynolds excellent team. At least this is in the second year in which this whole process has been going on. That deliberation that set of decisions and whatnot is the purview of the Board the responsibility of the Board and I'm not going to trespass in terms of that and I'm not going to try to handicap what their decisions are and whatnot. That's something that they will do, but I can tell you that they've been working diligently on this for -- it's been a major topic for a couple of years.
Mark Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Incorporated
Brett Huff: Good morning, guys. And Phil, I'll add my congratulations. We're sad to see you go, but I hope the next step is a good one.
Phil Heasley: Thank you.
Brett Huff: My question -- one of my questions is about bookings. Scott, I think, if I'm remembering right, I think net new bookings were up 12% for the quarter and you said for 4Q kind of stronger than that. Is that the right message?
Scott Behrens: Yes. On an FX-adjusted basis Q3 was up 15%. We expect to exit the year strong. Q4 should be even stronger than that. And so obviously exiting the year strong.
Brett Huff: And you didn't reiterate your net new bookings annual guidance of high single to low double. Is that still in force? Or is that -- are we moving away from that?
Scott Behrens: I would say moving away a bit. We were off quite a bit in the first half. But that's why I think it's important to kind of look at the momentum and how we delivered in Q3. We'll finish the year strong. We think that momentum will carry us into next year. I think a lot of that obviously didn't impact the revenue and EBITDA guidance. Where that's going to be important is building backlog for future years.
Brett Huff: Okay.
Phil Heasley: Brett we get a lot of pushback from advisers and Board members and whatnot and they say software companies don't give bookings guidance and that it's not really -- it's a confusing category versus being a -- and when you kind of paint us in the same light as merchant acquirers and processors and whatnot really, looking at our bookings is, it is a little bit I suppose apples and oranges and whatnot, because we don't have -- the model doesn't -- the models just don't flow that way. And the more we become consumption based, it makes it even more difficult and whatnot. And I think that's a valid -- it's a valid set of questions.And I think what Scott is trying to say is, the slope going forward is much more important than taking a retro backwards whatnot. But probably even more important than that, we have to figure out or they have to figure out a way of thinking about how revenue grows right and forecasting how revenue grows in a different way of dealing with bookings, because in lots of cases the -- when something is booked, there is as little as nine months or six -- in some cases a little less than nine months and as much as two years before bookings become revenue. It's very different than the processing and it's very different than the acquiring businesses as it relates to that.It shows it's something that we have to do better, but we have to think about a better metric than bookings going forward. Craig and Scott and I have had that debate a little bit in terms, especially on the consumption side of the business, because it's certainly not apples-to-apples between consumption and on-premise.So we have to take that as a to-do in terms of giving --because we try to be very transparent. And I think we land up giving false positives false negatives in terms of how we do that. So I don't know if that's helpful or not.
Brett Huff: Yeah. That is helpful. Thanks. Follow-up question is on – Phil, I think you mentioned that there were, I think eight customers and four mergers that were kind of in this capital markets bubble that we had last year and earlier this year. I understood that there were two deals that were delayed. How does the forward number kind of figure into this?
Phil Heasley: Yeah. There were -- and I want to make sure we keep the same dialogue going. There's always been four deals of which there were two delays. The other two are on -- we've kept them forecast as scheduled, right? You guys all know what the four, I don't think I have to tell this group what the four deals were, right?
Brett Huff: Right. Right.
Phil Heasley: They're pretty straightforward. Two of the -- two sets of two. So half of them we thought as scheduled, the other half we thought. Now this is the difference between bookings, this again where bookings is a little bit full, Scott.One of the four hasn't closed yet. And we every bid is expected to close, right? But if it doesn't close that may impact a booking, right? And it may even for a quarter impact revenue, but we know that the subsequent -- we're very confident with the subsequent deal that comes from it.Like I said, as I was saying before, this is not a 90 -- trying to make this a nice and neat 90-day businesses, you don't do business five years at a clip and be able to explain it 90 days at a time other than thinking you're on a roller coaster.
Brett Huff: That's helpful. And then…
Phil Heasley: Did I further confuse you, or did you…
Brett Huff: No. That's great. And then last more qualitative. As these big mergers happen and these banks are -- these banks process are making big decisions to use your technology for another many, many, many years, right, maybe a decade or more. What is the overriding driver that drives them to ACIW? Is it the industrial strength? Is it the openness of the future proofing like -- that's a strategic decision by them. Can you just give us a quick highlight of…
Phil Heasley: Yeah. Let me reiterate something and of course the cloud will reinforce this in a big way. Our new technology what we've been working all these years on, right? If you had ACI's technology 10 years ago, 80% of the cost would have been hardware and middleware and we would have been 20% of the cost. So that if you were paying us if you were paying us $50 million over a period of time, you can consider that $200 million was being paid for hardware and middleware. And I'm not talking about premises and all that other kinds of stuff, just hardware and middleware.Our new software makes that $200 million, $50 million, okay? So you save $150 million of the $200 million. Yes, we still charge you the $50 million, and we absolutely deserve -- we deserve more than that, right, because we've saved you the other $150 million.So if I was going forward 10 years and saying, gee, I got something that's costing me, today $250 million in total, the ACI guys are $50 million, but now I have a future and it's somewhat up to me how I -- if you're an existing customer you have a task in front of you to transition it, but you've got a $200 million five-year save in terms of that that's pretty neat.What we're now beginning to see is, there's a lot of new guys coming into the market as the digital world is changing. What are you going to do? Go buy some old school thing that's going to be 80% hardware and middleware and 20%? Or you going to go with us and go on the cloud, or you're going to go with us and go to Linux.That's why this effort needs to be more about marketing and go-to-market than my buying and fixing companies to get us here, because the opportunity is not minor, it's massive, right, in terms of the productivity that's -- this is the typical productivity that we're going to see throughout the digital economy, whereas $250 million capital investments are going to be replaced with $100 million capital investments.And that's what real -- that's what this whole transformation is about. And the only thing that's holding us back is well I think regulation has held the banks back for a long time. And -- but I certainly think that Visa and Mastercard are beginning to get it. JPMorgan is doing a fabulous job of -- this is the dawn of a new era, right? There's no reason in the world they wouldn't commit for a long time. And there's no reason in the world they wouldn't accrue those kinds of efficiencies.And by the way this new environment can do two times, three times the volume that the other one did, which is both good for us and good for them.
Brett Huff: That's helpful.
Phil Heasley: Is that a good answer?
Brett Huff: That's great. Thanks for color. Appreciate it, Phil.
Operator: And there are no more further questions at this time. Speakers, you may proceed.

11;ACIW;2020-02-27;"Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the ACI Q4 Earnings Announcement Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. John Kraft. Thank you. Sir you may go ahead.
John Kraft: Thank you Sara and thank you all for joining our earnings call for the quarter and full year ending December 31, 2019.I'm joined this morning by Craig Saks, our Interim President and CEO and Scott Behrens, our CFO.Before we begin please take note of the forward-looking statement disclaimer included in our press release issued earlier today and filed with the SEC. We will make forward-looking statements on today's call including about 2020 guidance. Forward-looking statements inherently involved risks and uncertainties and reflect our view as of today and we are under no obligation to update this information.With that I'll turn it over to Craig.
Craig Saks: Thank you John. Good morning everyone. I trust you are all well this week's market noise aside. Nonetheless, thank you so much for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Before we discuss our results, I would first like to take a few minutes to talk about the leadership announcement we made last week.Since Phil Heasley announced his intention to retire back in November, the board has continued working on a succession planning process which included working with executive search firm Russell Reynolds to identify potential candidates to be his successor.As you saw following a comprehensive process ACI has appointed Odilon Almeida as President and Chief Executive Officer effective March 9, 2020. He will also serve as a member of ACI's board of directors. Odilon joins ACI from Advent International where he was most recently an operating partner supporting business development at the fund’s portfolio companies, with a particular focus on growth initiatives that supported the higher sales and earnings.Prior to his time at Advent, Odilon had a distinguished 17-year career with Western Union culminating in his role as president of Western Union's global money transfer business. Odilon is a seasoned executive with leadership experience spanning multiple industries and countries, two decades of payments experience and a strong track record of growth acceleration and value creation. He has a deep understanding of ACI's markets and customer segments and as proven expertise leading companies that are navigating digital transformation. I look forward to getting to know him better and working with him in my new role as chief strategy and transformation officer. ACI has tremendous prospects for growth and long-term shareholder value creation and we're all excited to have Odilon help us achieve our goals.With that I'll now turn to our results. As we announced in our January call, ACI's 2019 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted principally by a large customer expansion contractors that did not sign as expected in December. As a result of this contract not signing as expected as well as other deals have slipped into 2020 our new bookings also did not meet expectations. I am however, pleased to announce that we have made progress on the delayed 2019 contract. Recently this customer signed an amendment to our contract which renews the current relationship and secures our long-term commitment to ACI. While this contract renewal does not deliver incremental revenue at this time, it includes a framework for future increases in capacity and enables us to focus on growing our relationship. As a mutual affirmation of our partnership as well as the next step towards a future expansion I view this very positively as a win-win.Now that we have closed our 2019 financials, I would like to put the fully into context and share some customer highlights and momentum that position us very well for 2020 and beyond. Scott will follow with some additional details on our financials in a few minutes.2019 was a positive year for ACI's on many levels. We continue to advance and grow our business amid the M&A activity that transform parts of our industry. We believe we have a unique value proposition serving the Real-Time any-to-any payment needs of banks, intermediaries, billers and merchants.We continue to secure strategic wins that validate ACI's strength and leadership across the Real-Time, retail pavements merchants and e-commerce payments, board payments and payment intelligence areas. Our pipelines are strong. Our solutions continue to be industry leaders. Our recurring revenue streams are a large and growing part of our business and we are confident about our outlook.In terms of growth ACI's revenue increased 25% over 2018 with a speed per acquisition making an important contribution to both revenue and EBITDA. The acquisition board substantial scale and profitability to our ACI and demand business which now represents more than half of consolidated revenues and contributes to our more than 70% recurring revenue.On an organic basis in 2019, ACI also grew revenues in key solution areas in particular e-commerce and Real-Time payments which represent two of the fastest growing transaction areas globally. Strong growth in these areas validates our strategy and positioning efforts. With an unmatched number of payment endpoints and global reach ACI is very well positioned to season even greater share of these opportunities in 2020 and beyond.Now I'd like to turn to our core customer segments highlighting representative customer wins and momentum. Starting with our biller customer segment. The additional speed paid places ACI as the number one direct bill pay provider in the U.S. We see further opportunities to accelerate revenue growth in this business via the additional functionality including the fast growing areas of Real-Time payments and subscription billing. Our roadmap is advancing as we bring together the Speedpay front end with the ACI back-end integrate best-in-class biller platform capable of tremendous scale and continued improved operating margins.We continue to see strong retention and cross-sell opportunities among our biller base. In particular, we are very pleased with our early success in adding our patented mobile digital wallet solution to our existing base of customers.In Q4 we signed both new and expanded electronic bill payment deals in key verticals including utilities, insurance, consumer finance and government. Let me highlight a few examples. One of these was a multi year renewal with one of the largest utilities in the U.S. which represented one of the largest ACI contracts ever signed. Another utility we signed in Q4 was Clay Electric, one of the largest electric co-ops in the U.S. which will utilize ACI's speed paid to enhance its customer experience. Also in Q4, we signed Grange Mutual, a leading property and casualty insurance provider and in the government segment a large mid-Atlantic states signed the deal to utilize our bill payment solution to support permit payments.Shifting to our merchant customer segment. Our e-commerce platform supported a stellar holiday season. We processed 50% more transactions across the globe in Q4, 2019 than we did in 2018, ACI continues to be successful in winning new business and supporting the growing payment needs of some of the world's largest brands for a range of Omni-Channel e-commerce and fraud prevention needs.In 2019 we secured leading retailers with our merchants and e-commerce solutions. We also had a very strong renewal and expansion activity in Q4 representative merchant deals in Q4 included a leading fuel retailer which expanded its use of ACI solutions to better serve customers at thousands of convenience stores across North America. We also signed one of the world's largest furniture stores to expand its use of ACI as it grows its e-commerce footprint.A global sportswear giant selected ACI technology to simplify its payments globally. Also in retail we find one of the largest auto care companies in the U.S. extending its relationship with ACI to improve transaction processes. And we signed large supermarkets including a U.S. based super market giant and ICA one of Sweden's biggest retailers who use ACI solutions to better serve their many thousands of customers.For banks and intermediaries ACI continues to be the payment provider of choice supporting digital transformation as these organizations seek to modernize the infrastructures, enable open APIs and embrace Real-Time payments and the public cloud. Our leading Real-Time payments, retail payments, digital payments and payment intelligence solution are solving the complex needs of financial institutions they enter new markets, scale to address higher payment volumes and meet customer needs.In Q4 we launched a global strategic collaboration of Microsoft to support payments in the cloud and in 2019 three banks selected ACI’s retail payment solution running on Microsoft Azure to power their global payments platforms. Two of the three both of which are top -- global top 30 banks signed in Q4.Our investment in Mind Gate solutions in India is allowing us to seize the very exciting Real-Time payment opportunity in that market and other growth market and other growth markets. In particular our Real-Time solutions continue to see success both with new logos as well as selling into our retail payment space.I'm very proud to say that in an unaided global server of payment decision makers ACI was again the top recognized and preferred brand for Real-Time payments for a second year in a row. This is a very strong validation of our strategy. Some Q4 highlights in the banking intermediary segment included BB&T and SunTrust which recently merged to form trust the sixth largest bank in the U.S. extended its commitment to ACI's UP Real-Time payment solution. BNP Paribas, one of the world's largest banks is consolidating several high-value payment systems into a single ACI UP Real-Time payment solution. BNPP is currently live in seven countries and will add another eight countries during 2020. In the quarter we also signed ING, a leading multinational banking and financial services corporation and long-term ACI customer who expanded its use of UP retail payments to keep up with increasing transaction volumes.In Indonesia one of the three largest banks is utilizing both UP retail payments and UP Real-Time payments as a single payment hub to ready itself for the country's upcoming rollout of immediate payments. And in Mexico one of the largest banks Banorte, expanded its use of UP retail payments for its open banking and systems consolidation strategy.Finally, Network International the largest payment process in the Middle East and the first independent vendor certified by both Visa and MasterCard for payments in the region has expanded its use of UP retail payments as it enters new geographies.All in all these deals and many of the exciting deals we are working on at the moment underpin our confidence in ACI's growth prospects in the payments industry. Our 2020 pipeline is strong and we expect solid revenue growth. We have also implemented several initiatives aimed at both reducing costs and reallocating resources towards our fastest growing solutions.On the sales side we continue to adjust our sales processes to better target our evolving marketplace. Our sales teams are fully staffed and have already hit the ground running in Q1. Our go-to-market approach is our customer segment focus with dedicated sales, solution consulting and customer success teams who are tightly aligned to the needs of banks, intermediaries, merchants and billers. This transformation of our sales practices provides a solid foundation for future sales performance improvement and is already demonstrating positive results.In addition, our customers are also responding well to this approach by renewing and expanding their relationships with us. In our most recent annual survey at the end of 2019 our customer experience scores increased significantly in all categories including in the very important areas of customer satisfaction and likelihood to continue, recommend and expand the relationship with ACI. I'd like to compliment the whole ACI team for the ongoing efforts in these areas.In summary, our fundamentals are sound. We're off to a good start in 2020 and we have a lot of growth opportunities to be optimistic about in the years ahead.And with that I'll now turn over the call to Scott to provide some additional financial highlights. Thank you very much.
Scott Behrens: Well, thanks Craig and good morning everyone. I first plan to go through the highlights of 2019 and then provide our outlook for 2020.I'll be starting my comments on slide 6 with key takeaways from the year. Our overall bookings were down from 2018 with higher term extensions offset by lower new bookings. As Craig mentioned this was partially resolved a large expansion contract that did not sign as expected as well as other deals that slip into 2020. And going forward we're evaluating the use of this metric and considering adjusting future reporting to be more applicable to our evolving business which is shifted from being traditional software license base to now more than half of our revenue coming from our on-demand solutions.We saw strong backlog growth with 12 month and 60 month backlog up $18 million and $144 million respectively with most of that growth coming in the fourth quarter. Full-year revenue was $1.3 billion up 25 % over last year and excluding the impact of Speedpay and foreign currency revenue for the year was up 3% organically.Recurring revenue grew to 71% of total revenue, up from 65% in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $308 million, up 23% from last year. EBITDA margins expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year driven by the contribution from Speedpay as well as the improving margin in our AOD business as we focus on profitability growth.Turning next to our operating segments. Our on-demand segment grew 57 % driven primarily by the Speedpay contribution and continues to deliver solid margin improvement with our net adjusted EBITDA margins hitting 19% this year compared to 5% last year. And specifically our fourth quarter net adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% which represents the highest quarterly margin contribution ever for our on-demand business and shows solid progress towards our Rule of 40 targets. This margin expansion will continue to improve with scale as we grow into the infrastructure we've built out over the last few years and we expect 2020 to take another step higher.Our On Premise segment grew slightly from 2018 and delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of 55%. Adjusted operating free cash flow is $108 million versus $148 million 2018. We ended the year with $121 million in cash and $1.4 billion in debt bringing us to a pro-forma net leverage ratio of 3.75 times. During the year we purchased 1.2 million shares for $36 million or $29 per share and we have 141 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.Turning next to slide 7, with our outlook for 2020 as previously provided on our January call for 2020 we expect total revenue to be between $1.48 billion and $1.51 billion which represents approximately 18% to 20 % growth over 2019. Recall that Speedpay was acquired on May 9, 2019 and so 2019 results include only a partial year of Speedpay. So part of the growth we expect in 2020 will come from having a full-year contribution from Speedpay.We expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $425 million to $450 million which represents approximately 38 % to 44 % growth over 2019 and similar to our revenue targets our EBITDA growth will also benefit from having a full year of Speedpay contribution 2020 versus just a partial contribution in 2019.in addition, our commitment to achieving our long-term profitability goals include continually assessing our operating efficiencies in 2020 we expect to realize approximately $20 million of cost reductions from these initiatives and those are assumed in our guidance. This guidance excludes between 5 million and 10 million of continued integration related expenses from Speedpay and approximately $10 million of one-time charges to implement the cost reduction initiatives and as it relates to the large renewal Craig mentioned earlier we have secured the long-term commitment from this customer from this renewal but we don't expect any incremental impact to 2020 at this time.Also on slide 7, we did provide additional guidance information to help you build out your financial models and finally we expect Q1 revenue to be between $285 million and $295 million which is an increase of 38% to 43 % over Q1, 2019 and though we're not providing full yearning bookings outlook at this time as I mentioned earlier as we assess more applicable industry standard metric for our SaaS and PaaS business we do expect Q1 new bookings to be a solid double-digit grower over Q1, 2019 on a consistent reporting basis.So in closing, we expect to deliver solid revenue and profitability growth in 2020. So that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator we're ready to open the line for questions at this time.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson. You may ask your question.
Peter Heckmann: Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on getting that slip deal closed and maintaining some discipline around those deals. I'm curious so, while it certainly sounds like it will help front-load bookings for the year. How is the contract structured so that we don't, we shouldn't expect a initial license fee related to that contract expansion in 2020?
Scott Behrens: Yes. I think to clarify what this is, they've renewed for the long term on what they already have. So that secures the long term commitment of this customer on our products. This is not the expansion deal if we were talking about at the end of last year. So I would say at this time there's no incremental revenue just from the pure renewal but that has committed them to the long term but I bet generally speaking it provides a framework for future expansion.
Craig Saks: Yes. Let me elaborate slightly on that. I think it's a very important point. The big question in the market was does ACI have long term relevance in the post M&A era. Well, this continues to validate our importance to the very biggest players and our aptness to the very biggest and globalized players and the parties have reaffirmed our mutual commitment to each other and growing up businesses as together. So that's correct and within that construct of the renewal which gives us that long-term certainty, we've established a framework where we will work together to grow the relationship as their business grows and so I think it's a very constructive outcome. It takes a big strategic question off the table and helps us focus on mutual growth in the coming years.
Peter Heckmann: Great Craig. That's helpful. And just a follow-up then, I guess my understanding of the five-year term license contracts with volume components, was that if a customer did make a major acquisition then they really had to complete that contract expansion before they could do their own internal platform consolidation and so is there a time where the remaining three large companies going through mergers have to complete those contract expansions?
Craig Saks: So as and when they run out of capacity which is a function of a number of different things, their own growth rates and some of them are growing really nicely in some of their markets as we understand it or when they win new add-on business all of whom as part of the rationale of the consolidation is that they want to target new add-on business. So either of those events typically would drive a conversation with us as the round expanding the amount of capacity they need to buy and of course when they come in buy capacity over and above the run rate of the current arrangement for example the one we've just renewed then obviously its add-on business and new revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. You may ask question.
George Sutton: Thank you. A big focus that your analyst day was around the concept of the scale that you can now really achieve given where you stand. The organic growth in 2019 was low single digits. I'm curious as we look out to 2020 and beyond particularly with a new CEO coming in extensively with some growth focus, what are the governor's to that organic growth and what are the real opportunities?
Craig Saks: So the opportunities let me start there. So as we said in the call I think there are myriad of opportunities. Let me highlight three just off the top of my head. Real-Time really does continue to become to be a very important trend in the marketplace. Our brand leadership I think is a fantastic affirmation of our ability to participate in that as quite frankly our product leadership in that realm.So we're excited about Real-Time. We continue to see opportunities evolve. So that's the first thing but beyond Real-Time as a standalone opportunity we are seeing significant opportunity with Real-Time in conjunction with other solutions.Two examples would be the addition of Real-Time tubular. It's only a matter of time before Real-Time and expedited bill pay becomes an important part of the biller direct equation in the U.S. and so we're excited about that and we are rolling out Real-Time payments as part of a biller solution through this year and expect good results from that.The other place that Indonesian Bank, I mentioned for me is a great example of what's happening quite often. Banks are sitting with a large card franchises which are historically powered by ACI and they are wrestling with how do we convert that to an account to account or a multi payment rail kind of environment to a multi payment type hub and just about every one of our large card customers is talking to us about the addition of Real-Time payments to the existing ACI footprints.And so that not only expands those relationships but quite frankly protects those franchises for the long term as volumes may start to transition from one realm to the other.And in the third area that continues to excite us is all things online. E-commerce is good. You could probably regard some of our bill payments as being in a form of e-commerce and the growth rates and the macro forces in the industry remain solid. So there are a whole bunch of or fundamentals around the world that continue to be interesting to our business and represent future opportunities.I think impediments to that quite frankly or in our own four walls, it's our ability to execute on those sale, it's our ability to deploy those ones quickly and we continue to really double down our efforts on being a better sales organization, a more consistent sales organization and to operate, optimize, our operating processes in terms of getting customers live.So, that's driven your this flow quickly.
Scott Behrens: Yes. I think the only thing I want to add is -- yes, the only thing I got to add to that, George, is when it comes to the scale. I mentioned we're looking at operational efficiencies, we're looking at -- we're actually looking at the head in producing costs in certain areas of our business and reinvesting costs into some of those high growth areas.And also if you look at our Q4 exit rate on our On Demand business had the highest EBITDA margins ever. So, that scale is going to layer on top of a relatively fixed cost base or also where we'd continue to drive improved efficiencies. But to be able to drive a pretty high dollar revenue to EBITDA conversion.So, that gets back another scale as we start to see accelerated growth, we're also going to see a high conversion to EBITDA.
George Sutton: A couple of things, you did not mention Craig, and we've talked about them a lot in the past would be the Azure partnership and I think the ability to continue grow through that. And then also Linux as a hardware component that lowers the ultimate cost of a changeover or what are those doing for your pipeline of opportunities?
Craig Saks: The public cloud is a strong driver of opportunity and discussion. And I mentioned that Azure once we had last year. We continue to build and grow that relationship with Microsoft. In fact, on the in Redmond next week to continue those discussions and to further the go-to market plan.So, I feel very good about the opportunity that the public cloud gives us as our customer base more-and-more think about the impact of you know the public cloud on their deployment option. We also quite frankly see it is going to open up some new opportunity. It makes it easier for existing customers to expand into new markets.It also makes it easy for new entrance. And so, we're finding that we have some new opportunities that are coming out of the woodwork just because it takes the barriers of entry from an infrastructure prospect of a way as people think about growing the global payment businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi from Canaccord. You may ask your question.
Joseph Vafi: Hi gentlemen, good morning. I was wondering just kind of circling back to the first question and the outlook here for this year. Just with M&A back to our perhaps kind of dying down now a little bit.Do you see that relative to the guidance reducing potential lumpiness in large deals and the ability to -- I'm sorry, and less lumpiness for the guidance given the competitor or the M&A landscape are perhaps settling down?
Scott Behrens: While may -- and our licensed software business I think is always going to have an element of lumpiness to it just because of the nature of recognizing all the license fee at signing. And so, and a lot of our sales happen in the second half of the year. A lot of our renewals happen under Anniversary dates.That’s where we get another lumpiness in the inflow of license fees. Those are typically going to be in the third and fourth quarter. So, I think with on the licensed software side of the business, we're still going to see that lumpiness.On but our On Demand business is now become an over 50% of our overall business. That is inherently our recurring revenue a much more predictable recurring quarter-over-quarter on a sequential basis. And with this Speedpay acquisition last year, so it not only did bring a lot of recurring revenue to our business, brought a lot of recurring profitability.And so, that also is going to level out the quarterly variability. But so I'd say as our On Demand business gets bigger, it'll produce the lumpiness, the software license software side of the business will still have that degree of lumpiness just due to the timing of sales and the timing of renewals.
Joseph Vafi: Sure, that's helpful. And then just on the Real-Time side of things, it sounds like a lot of banks a lot of financial institutions, a lot of merchants or billers are eager to perhaps get this going at a bigger level especially in the U.S. do you see there being a kind of a catalyst or larger adoption here across the payments landscape and at least in the U.S. to real-time.It seems like we need to have something of a network effect in place with enough players involved in and been able to provide it that you can kind of really light it up and make it kind of a capability that is kind of more pervasive in the market place. Thanks.
Craig Saks: Yes. And you were talking right. The dynamic that drives adoption and then the rate of adoption varies by market and they extend to which the regulators are involved. Then in the U.S. I've seen a little bit of an increased urgency after the FedNow announcement.So, I've seen normal activity of people deploying and trying to activate the core infrastructures we already have with The Clearing House and with Zelle. Just this last week or so announcement from one of the large core providers where they had activated 100s of banks.So, on the Zelle network, and if that's your point, the metric effect is building up to a critical mass. And we pretty close I believe to the tipping point in terms of banks in the broader ecosystem that are all connected with the big core players participating more-and-more with the big banks that are already out there.So, that's the first thing. And then, then the second thing is as that critical mass from connected consumers and the accounts build that you're going to start to see the applications. That's one of the reasons why I'm actually quite excited about bill pay.In our position in the market place and the relevance of bill pay is going to support the real-time story is actually going to greatly supported by the tipping point that we're getting to in terms of critical mass of connected participant.So, I would argue that in the next few years you're going to see very aggressive growth in the use and adoption of real-time in the U.S. as the metric effects kick in and reach maturity.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. You may ask your question.
Brett Huff: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time today.
Craig Saks: Hi, Brett.
Brett Huff: Question on just the numbers. I want to make sure that I understood the implied organic growth for '20. You gave us a range on the '20 outlook. And you hopefully which is kind of 1.495 billion mid-point'ish. But then you also gave us I think a $228 million what I think is the stub or the partial year in organic revenue contribution from Speedpay.And if I remove that from the 1495 or so mid-point, that gets me kind of just slightly positive organic revenue growth. Is that the right way to think about those numbers or am I getting that a little long?
Scott Behrens: Yes, the range on the organic side and you're right we didn’t break out the Speedpay from the organic. But it would be low-to-mid single digits.
Brett Huff: Okay. That's helpful. And then, the sales process Craig that I think that you talked about, what was the driver for that, is this just sort of a normal must take a look at the sales process. Was it driven by something specific, I mean these larger deals was is there a what may be a way to take care of these larger renewals or opportunities better or kind of give us a sense of the driver of it.And then, if you could just sort of kind of rearticulate the two or three key changes that have been made or will be made. Thanks, guys.
Craig Saks: Yes. So, the -- and look we've been at this for a few years and then quite frankly it was driven by a desire to grow our business through more new business win. And we got fantastic products and the fantastic global footprints and we've not been enthralled by the rate of growth that we managed to get through new business developments.So, it really is a desire to make sure that we get our fair share and more. And so, we've been reengineering ourselves organization for the last while and particularly doubled on last year. As we look forward at the opportunity we saw. And we definitely did not see ourselves as this being trapped in the cash car kind of spaces.We see ourselves being in a more to with growth opportunity. And so, this is a sharp end of that spear. So, that's what really motivated it. In terms of things we've done, there's a huge list there and number of activities that we reengineered the sales process into in I would call out refreshed and reengineered pipeline management and forecasting processes.I would talk to a doubling done on the sale of leadership that we have in place and the alignment of that sales leadership to our key customer segment. I think that's really important. We've got 10 points in your team that leadership and in-depth knowledge and alignment with the customers is really going to help. And then the last thing is it's not just about the sales organization, we've really doubled down the organization.Sales is a one ACI team sport. And so, we've reengineered and integrated the product side of the house with the operating side of the house, with the sales side of the house with the marketing side of the house and with the customer success side of the house to make sure that the entire ACI engine is aligned around the task of sales and winning new business.And we've made great strides over the last six to 12 months of having a far more aligned organization that is far more committed to selling. If you sat in on our executive meetings the last few months compared to many years ago, I can tell you now we spend much more if not the majority of our meeting time talking about sales and winning in the market than we've ever done in the past.And for me, that's part of the positive trend towards becoming very sales centric on our day-to-day thinking as a company.
Operator: There are no further question at this time. Presenters, you may continue.
Craig Saks: Well, thanks everybody for dialing in. we look forward to catching up in the coming weeks. Have a great day.
Scott Behrens: Bye-bye.

12;ACIW;2020-05-08;"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the ACI Q1 Earnings Announcement [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. John Kraft. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
John Kraft: Thanks, Justin and good morning everybody. Thank you all for joining us on this earnings call for the quarter ending March 31, 2020. Today’s call like all of our events is subject to both Safe Harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website, as well as with the SEC. I’m joined this morning by Odilon Almeida, our President and CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO.With that, I’ll turn it over to over Odilon.
Odilon Almeida: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call and my first one as President and CEO of ACI Worldwide. In the next few minutes, we will cover the Q1 results, our response to the COVID-19 crisis and my view about the medium and long-term growth potential of our company.We are pleased with our first quarter financial performance. We generated revenue of $291 million, up 42% over last year. From a profitability perspective, our adjusted EBITDA increased to $38 million, with margin expansion to 19% from 5% last year. We are fortunate to have a resilient business model, which involves multiyear customer commitments with a large contractual backlog of $5.7 billion. In addition, nearly 75% of our annual revenues are recurring in nature, which provide us with reliable cash flows. In the quarter, we generated $58 million in cash flow from operations and exit Q1 with a strong liquidity position, consisting of $119 million in cash on the balance sheet and $270 million of available revolver capacity.Now I would like to turn your attention to the current COVID-19 situation. I hope, first and foremost, that you and your families are staying safe and well. The last few months have posed unprecedented challenges for countries and communities around the world. We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees, all while enabling them, include implementation teams to seamlessly support our customers, without interruption. Our team has remained highly focused on providing our customers with a software-led payment solutions they need, at a time when digital payments are more critical than ever.We are fortunate to have a strong customer base, which includes large global banks, financial intermediaries, bidders and omnichannel retailers, including e-commerce, most of whom are also well positioned to weather the COVID-19 disruption. In 2020, we will focus on maximizing profitability, while advancing our pipeline of deals, to position ACI for future continuous profitable growth.Now moving to the future, I would like to give you my perspective about ACI and its growth potential, as well as my thoughts on our path forward. Through my 30 plus year career, I have had a track record in realigning companies and operations for value creation through revenue growth. The importance I place on integrity, accountability and diversity has helped me guide different cultures, and markets around the globe. Over the past two months, I have had the chance to speak with many customers, employees and leaders of our company. It is clear to me, that ACI has a strong portfolio of customers and software-led payment solutions, and most importantly, the human capital to succeed. Going forward, I will be assessing our operating structure, business processes, product portfolio, and investments, to ensure we are organized for sustainable, predictable, profitable growth.Our growth will be enabled by three pillars. Number one, we will accelerate organic growth. A nimble, agile, fit for growth structure will maximize the revenue opportunity. We will focus CapEx and OpEx behind growth areas, and operational discipline will be our internal language. A strong and global sales culture will lead the company into the future and will assure that our customers are in the center of our actions.Number two, we will focus R&D on differentiating innovation, such as investing in our fast growing real-time payments; and number three, M&A will continue to provide our shareholders with a step change value creation. Over the coming quarters, I will provide you updates on where we are in this transformation, but you can expect a sense of urgency and a bright future ahead of us.I will now turn the call over to Scott, to provide additional financial highlights. Scott?
Scott Behrens: Thanks Odilon and good morning everyone. I first plan to go through our results for the quarter and then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of the year. We’ll then open the line for questions.I’ll be starting my comments on Slide 8, with key takeaways from the quarter. New bookings were $120 million, up 7% from Q1 last year. We ended the quarter with a 12 month backlog of $1.1 billion and a 60 month backlog of $5.7 billion. Q1 revenue came in at $291 million, up 42% compared to Q1 last year, with our On-Demand business growing 76%, driven primarily by the Speedpay acquisition. While our On-Premise business grew 3%, with particular strength coming from our real-time payment solution, which grew 20% over Q1 last year.This revenue growth contributed to strong growth in adjusted EBITDA, with Q1 EBITDA coming in at $38 million, up from $8 million in Q1 last year. We continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in our On-Demand business, with net EBITDA margins increasing to 22% in Q1, from essentially zero in Q1 last year. And this really shows again, the scale of our On-Demand business, where we’re able to layer on incremental recurring revenue on to a relatively fixed cost structure. We also saw EBITDA margin expansion in our On-Premise segment, with EBITDA margins improving to 31% from 29% last year.Turning next to Slide 9, starting with debt and liquidity, cash flow from operations was $58 million in the quarter, up 36% from Q1 last year. We ended the quarter with significant liquidity with $119 million in cash and $270 million available on our revolver. We use cash in the quarter to pay down $19 million of debt and also repurchased 1 million shares of our stock. Our current debt balance is $1.4 billion, which represents a net debt leverage ratio of 3.6 times, compared to the maximum leverage in our credit facility of 4.75 times. And also a note here, is that we have relatively low required term debt repayments for the rest of 2020 and 2021, of approximately $29 million and $39 million respectively.Turning next to our outlook for the rest of 2020. As previously announced, given the uncertainties around COVID-19, we have temporarily suspended our financial guidance for the rest of the year, so I won’t give you full financial ranges, but I will provide you with some incremental color on our customer segments, and where we may see some financial impact.So with that, turning to Slide 10, we thought it would be helpful to highlight really, our resilient business model and our customer mix, which includes some of the world’s largest banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and billers. You’ll see here our customer mix broken out into our two P&L statements, starting with On-Premise, which was just under half of our consolidated revenues last year, nearly two-thirds of our On-Premise business is represented by large global banks, most with more than $50 billion in assets. 30% of this segment is what we call financial intermediaries or the large technology providers that cater to the smaller and mid-sized financial institutions. And the smallest group here is merchant, which represents less than 10% of the segment. Although the merchants we target are generally large omnichannel merchants, with a significant e-commerce presence. We really have no small or mid-size customers in our On-Premise business.It’s also important to note here, that these customers are on five-year fixed term software subscription contracts for license and product support fee. So a large stable customer base, with fixed contractual committed revenue streams. The uncertainty with this segment is really the non-recurring license and service revenue from sales in-year, and how quickly the customer base will be back making purchasing decision, once that COVID-19 subsides.Moving next to our On-Demand business, this business is substantially all recurring revenue and doesn’t have as much the lumpiness and timing issues as we have in the On-Premise business, but it is more susceptible to near-term changes in payment transaction volumes. This business is roughly three quarters. electronic bill payment. You’ll see here, our main customer segments in bill pay are a third consumer finance and insurance, a third utilities, and a third higher education and government. This business is transaction-based, and any changes in consumer bill payment volumes will impact the revenue we receive. And one of important timing note here, we do expect some seasonality shift in this segment, especially in the federal and state tax payments, which typically would spike in Q2, are now expected to come in Q3, as many of the tax filing deadlines have been pushed out 90 days.The next largest segment here are merchant retailers, which represents roughly 10% of the On-Demand segment. Again we have a particular strong presence in e-commerce merchants. Obviously, some retailers are seeing transactions declines, while others are seeing notable increases. This business is less impacted by rest of year sales, meaning if it’s not already sold and installed, it’s not likely to deliver a significant amount of in-year revenue. The uncertainty with this business is really around the volatility in transaction volumes. But overall it’s important to remember, regardless of whether it’s in our On-Demand or On-Premise business, this is not discretionary spending. These are mission critical payment systems for our customers.About 75% of our annual revenues are recurring, and we also have committed contractual backlog of non-recurring service revenue, which we’re able to continue to operate, serve remotely, as well as license fees from renewals. But that still leaves us with a significant amount of revenue that we derived from in-year sales. And while we’re optimistic about our pipeline of deals, the duration, severity of COVID-19 outbreak has caused uncertainty about the timing of those signings, and that’s why we’re suspending the financial guidance for 2020. But as Odilon said, we are prioritizing profitability during this period and have already taken and continue to evaluate further steps this year to reduce our cost base.So that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line to questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi from Canaccord. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Joseph Vafi: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call and welcome and congratulations Odilon, on the new position. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about strength and real-time payments in the quarter? And then, perhaps as a follow-up, what you see as the strategy in real-time moving forward? Thank you.
Scott Behrens: Yes, well, I think – Joe, this is Scott. I mean that the growth in the quarter, the 20% growth is pretty consistent with the types of double-digit growth we’ve been seeing in real time for a number of years. I will say, that we did have a net – one of our net new logo sales in the quarter, was actually a fast growing U.S. commercial bank that purchased both our Universal Online Banker, in combination with real-time payments. We also had one of our Asian – existing Asian customers, that renewed retail payments, but also purchased a real-time payments as well.So we’re seeing it – again consistent with what we’ve seen as double-digit growth now for a number of years. Obviously, we see that as a fast growing segment with a significant amount of opportunity, and we’re selling at both net new – new logos, as well as combining it with our renewals.
Odilon Almeida: So Joe, nice meeting you and just to reinforce, I mean this will continue to be one area of priority for us. There’s a lot of growth in real time around the world. And you know that real-time is different in every country that you go. And I think that is a place that you can really build a strength from a local point of view and we have the DNA to do that. So I foresee a great future for us in real-time payments.
Joseph Vafi: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open, please ask your question.
George Sutton: Thank you. First Scott, thanks for the customer mix breakdown. I think that’s helpful and Odilon welcome to your first call. So I have a bigger picture question, given that you’ve just joined a question I think a lot of investors have been asking, there aren’t a lot of remaining payment businesses in this size range, most of them have been acquired and scale is really important. So I’m curious, where you see ACI fitting into the long-term payments market with that, kind of as a backdrop and maybe from the perspective of the On-Demand in the On-Premise?
Odilon Almeida: Sure. Nice to meet you. I see ACI with a very relevant space going forward and this is a scale business. There is always a space for differentiation. And I think that ACI is well positioned to differentiate itself or to continue to differentiate itself in some very specific areas. For example, real-time payments. It’s a part of strength for us and as you know, I mean it’s not about having global scale in real time, it’s about having local scale, in the country that you are, and we are very well positioned on that. And it is a race, and we are driving this race very consciously. And there are also other spaces that you can create differentiation. So I think that there is a very strong value proposition for ACI going forward.
George Sutton: Could you discuss organic growth potential? Take a longer-term view outside of the COVID era? I’m curious what you envision that opportunity to be?
Odilon Almeida: Yes, I’m not, I’m not giving numbers at this point. But what I can tell you is that, I think that we are very well positioned. And the opportunities, there are significant opportunities. I think if you look at the company, the company has been very successful in organic, and we will continue to do that. Also it has been very successful in differentiating its offerings, like the R&D investment and so forth. There is one part that we can improve, and that should be no surprise, because that was said, I think by the end of last year in the investors meeting, which is really about the scaling part of the business. It is about the go-to-market part of the business, and that’s my DNA. My DNA is on growth, as in revenue growth, and it’s about the structure you have, it is about the process you have and it is about the culture you have. I use one kind of phrase all the time, which is blood on the teeth on sales, right, and I think you’re going to see much more of that in our business going forward.
George Sutton: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.

13;ACIW;2020-08-09;"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the ACI Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. John Kraft, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
John Kraft: [Technical Difficulty] today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC. On this morning's call is Odilon Almeida, our CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. Before I turn it over, I'd like to share that company management will be attending the Wells Fargo Virtual Fifth Annual Technology Services Forum on August 11; The Canaccord 40th Annual Growth Conference, August 12; and the Second Annual Needham Virtual, Fintech and Digital Transformation one-on-one conference on August 19. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Odilon.
Odilon Almeida: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On our last earnings call in May, COVID-19 and its unprecedented global impact on people and economies was top of mind and a central focus of our discussion. Now in August, we find ourselves in a slightly different circumstances but with many of the same challenges. I hope you and your families are staying safe and well. And we at ACI, remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees as we seamlessly support our customers. On today's call, I will begin with our second quarter financial results. Importantly, I'd also like to share in more detail, my vision for profitable revenue growth and long-term value creation. We are living in a different world compared to even 3 or 4 months ago. While different parts of the globe are experiencing different stages and levels of severity of the pandemic, undoubtedly, there are ways in which our world has changed permanently. As it relates to ACI, the pandemic has heightened awareness and accelerated widespread acceptance of the essential role digital payment systems play in our modern economy. Starting with the second quarter. New sales bookings were $136 million, up 6% from Q2 last year. We saw particular strength in our Merchant business, signing 2 larger PSP contracts, R2 in Europe and HyperPay in Middle East that we allow these partners to offer Merchant acquiring eCommerce services to their customers in new geographies. Another area of continued strength in the quarter was real time. We signed a long-time support agreement with our customer, Rabobank, who was looking to expand its existing real-time payment offering by supporting batch payments. Another existing customer, one of the largest interbank switches in Indonesia, has selected ACI to orchestrate all their alternative payments, including QR, Alipay and other real-time offerings. Despite our revenues being impacted by COVID-19, our EBITDA increased by 42% compared to Q2 2019, with margin expansion increasing to 35%, up from 25% last year. Our efforts to improve operational discipline are working, and we continue to focus on maximizing profitability while advancing our pipeline of deals to position ACI for future continuous profitable growth. As I mentioned last quarter, we are fortunate to have a resilient business model with significant recurring revenue, reliable cash flows and high customer retention, all of which are helping us weather the COVID-19 related uncertainty. On our first quarter call, I shared with you my background and experience in realigning operations toward revenue growth, margin expansion and value creation. I also spoke about time I devoted to speaking with ACI's customers, employees and leaders. Since that time, I have also been getting feedback from our investors. These conversations have made clear to me that ACI has a strong portfolio of customers and software-led payment solutions and importantly, the human capital and talent to succeed. On the last earnings call, I have also communicated my initial and high-level perspectives on ACI's growth potential and the 3 pillars of our strategy, which will position the company for continuous profitable growth. Today, I'm pleased to share additional details on our progress. Over the last few months, we have engaged our best internal experts and industry-leading consultants to help us review our business and identify opportunities for efficiency gains and growth optimization. These small consultant teams have worked with me on several similar efforts over many years. We have a playbook with a proven track record. Although our work is not complete, we have identified key initiatives to support the 3 pillars of our strategy that will drive value creation opportunities for ACI. Our first pillar, Fit for Growth, is a refining and realignment of organizational structure and operating model to better position the company for organic growth. This involves reviewing the organization model and geographic footprint and designing an agile and nimble organization that is better at creating and sustaining continuous profitable organic growth. We are also designing a best-in-class global sales organization and culture. This initiative focuses on execution and will strengthen accountability, enhance transparency and reduce the duplicative costs throughout the company. We are very close to hiring a Chief Revenue Officer and a Chief Human Resources Officer to complete the leadership team. Our second pillar is called Focused on Growth. We will design an organic growth strategy that puts a disciplined focus on areas where we can optimize growth. We are reviewing our current solutions to identify the best opportunities to invest operating and capital expenditures going forward. We are focused on a smaller set of growth-rich software-led solutions, supported by differentiated innovation in specific geographies and market segments. We will ensure all of our priority solutions are cloud first in terms of architecture, deployment and operations. We will prioritize investments that have the best market opportunities, generate the highest revenue growth and cash flows and would yield the highest ROI. This will become a core discipline here at ACI. Importantly, this investment to come from cost discipline and reallocation, not incremental spending. Our third pillar is Step Change Value Creation through M&A. We have also continued to pursue accretive M&A to drive step change value creation for our shareholders and further expedite our growth. Executing on our 3-pillar strategy will encompass cost rationalization, which is already well underway. As we previously discussed, we actioned approximately $20 million in annual cash cost reductions in early 2020. During Q2, we further increased this amount by approximately $30 million in cost reductions related to COVID-19 by reducing the use of contractors, T&E expenses and other non-HR expenses for the rest of 2020. In addition, as part of our new strategy work, we are identifying additional cash cost savings by flattening our organizational structure, eliminating duplicative costs across our new organization and reducing our global facilities footprint. A good part of the savings will be reinvested behind growth, and we assure value maximization to our shareholders. Additionally, we are reviewing our capital allocation. Our short-term priority is to continue to deleverage the business. In Q2, we paid down $40 million, and our net debt ratio has declined to 3.3x as of Q2 2020. In the medium term, we will also reallocate free cash flow to invest in our business, return capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and undertake accretive M&A. We plan to provide an update on our progress implementing these initiatives on our Q3 earnings call. We also expect a full-some discussion during an Investor Day we are targeting for November 2020. A new ACI is underway and will be fully launched by January 2021. We understand there is much work to do. But as I have said before, I strongly believe we have the right team to succeed. There is a sense of urgency as well as optimism throughout the management team as we execute our new strategy to reposition the business for long-term value creation. To conclude, driving revenue growth is in my DNA and will be in the new ACI DNA, too. We have a clear vision. ACI is well positioned to capitalize on the emerging trends in digital payments and specifically, real-time payments. But we have plenty of room to improve in operational and go-to-market discipline and execution. I have no doubt that by executing on our 3-pillar strategy, leveraging our go-to-market experience and benefiting from a new cutting-edge sales process and culture, we will generate continuous profitable growth and significant value creation. I will now hand the call to Scott to discuss the company's Q2 results. Scott?
Scott Behrens: Thanks, Odilon, and good morning, everyone. I first plan to go through our results for the second quarter and then provide some high-level commentary regarding our expense reduction initiatives and outlook for the rest of 2020. We'll then open the line for questions. I'll be starting my comments on Slide 7 with key takeaways from the quarter. New bookings were $136 million, up 6% from Q2 last year as we continue to see strong growth in real-time payments as well as our Bill Pay solution. We ended the quarter with a 12-month backlog of $1.1 billion and a 60-month backlog of $5.8 billion. Q2 revenue came in at $300 million, up 2% from Q2 last year on a constant currency basis. The growth was driven primarily by having a full quarter of Speedpay revenue in 2020 versus a partial quarter in 2019. Excluding the impact of the incremental Speedpay revenue, revenue declined on a constant currency basis by roughly 10%, primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19. Looking at our On Demand business which saw a 15% decline, excluding Speedpay, the largest portion of the decline is related to the shift in tax payments from Q2 to Q3 as a result of the IRS and many of the state tax deadlines moving out 90 days this year. Aside from the government tax payments, we have seen year-over-year declines in other biller segments as a result of COVID-19 that those transaction declines have been offset by higher transactions from our secure eCommerce solution. We saw less of an impact from COVID-19 in Q2 in our On Premise business, which declined 2% compared to Q2 last year. Declines in nonrecurring license and service revenues were partially offset by higher recurring maintenance revenue. We saw total recurring revenue grow 4% compared to Q2 last year and now comprised of 78% of total revenue versus 75% of total revenue in Q2 last year. And despite the challenges related to COVID-19, we continue to focus on maximizing profitability. Our efforts to improve our operational discipline helped generate significant profitability growth in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, up 42% from Q2 last year. Consolidated net adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 35%, up from 25% last year, which represents nearly 1,000 basis points of improvement. It's important to note that this growth is not just a result of the incremental Speedpay contribution, as EBITDA also grew on an organic basis, improving 25% compared to Q2 last year. We saw profitability improvement in both our On Demand and our On Premise businesses on an organic basis. Turning next to Slide 8, starting with debt and liquidity. The solid growth in EBITDA delivered strong cash flow from operating activities of $68 million in the quarter, up more than 370% from Q2 last year. And we have significant liquidity as we ended the quarter, with $129 million in cash and $300 million available on our revolver. We also paid down $40 million of debt during the quarter. Our current debt balance is $1.3 billion, which represents a net debt leverage ratio of 3.3x. Turning next to our outlook for the rest of 2020, as previously announced, given the uncertainties around COVID-19, we've temporarily suspended our financial guidance for the rest of the year. So I won't give you full financial ranges, but I will say again that while revenues have been impacted by COVID-19, we are very focused on maximizing profitability and cash flow. As Odilon mentioned, we've actioned approximately $30 million in cost reductions in response to COVID-19 by reducing the use of contractors, T&E expenses and other non-HR expenses for the rest of 2020. This is in addition to the approximately $20 million in annual and ongoing cash cost reductions that we implemented as we enter 2020 pre-COVID. Further as part of our new strategy work, the team here is identifying additional cash cost savings by flattening our organizational structure, eliminating duplicative costs across our new organization and reducing our global facilities footprint. We anticipate that a good portion of the savings will be reinvested behind growth initiatives. Odilon and I and the rest of the management team are heavily engaged in this review, and we plan to provide more details at our November Investor Day. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are ready to open the line to questions at this time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question from the line of Peter Heckmann of Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: Scott, could you give us a little bit more color on the Bill Pay? I think I missed a comment there. Did you actually talk about how Bill Pay did and maybe your estimate of what type of volumes might have pushed into the third quarter?
Scott Behrens: Yes. What I mentioned was that we had -- the biggest driver of, ultimately, the decrease in Bill Pay year-over-year was the shift in the tax payments. And so, I didn't necessarily mention transaction volume, but the year-over-year Q2 decline related to government tax payments was about $16 million.
Peter Heckmann: Okay, okay. Yes. That's helpful. And have you seen that volumes then to have a commensurate uptick in July?
Scott Behrens: A good portion of that came back in July, but not all of it. I mean, obviously, we're going to have to see how the rest of the quarter goes and all the way through the extension timing to see if we get that all back. But a good portion came back in July.
Peter Heckmann: Great. Great. And then just one question on -- I noticed capitalized software looks like it's up about 40% year-to-date. What -- how are you thinking about that for the full year? And what are some of the projects that are included in -- that you're capitalizing development part.
Scott Behrens: Really, the only place we do that in is in our -- in parts of our On Demand business, so do the platforms. And so we're going through right now, platform consolidation. We're going through, especially in the Bill Pay side of the business and the front end under -- what we bought under Speedpay was the next-gen front end. And we're continuing to develop that. So I wouldn't look at Q2 as a trend by quarter going forward. Obviously, there was certain work that could certainly be progressed more in the last 90 days than others because that's more internal facing work.
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon of Needham.
Kyle Peterson: This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank. Just wanted to start out on gross margins. It looks like they were definitely one of the big drivers of the profitability upside this quarter. Just wanted to see how much of that was organic improvement versus Speedpay fully lapping and then try to get any flavor as to how much of that might be sustainable to keep expanding on the gross margin side in the back half of the year?
Scott Behrens: Yes. Well, if we just look at the pure organic business, we had a 25% increase in EBITDA year-over-year. And that contribution came across pretty much all of our cost lines. So it would have benefited at the gross margin line. And we saw a margin improvement in both the On Premise business and the AOD business. So again, it gets into the scale of the business and scale of the cost structure. Really, I would say there were two major costs reductions we did this year. If you recall, when we came into the year, we took out about $20 million annually in terms of operational efficiencies. Those are, what I'd call, more permanent in nature. Those are permanent parts of our cost structure. So they'll survive this year. They'll survive COVID. What we actioned really in late first quarter, early second quarter was an additional $30 million of cost, really specifically in reaction to COVID. I would generally consider those more temporary in nature, things like travel expenses, some of our trade shows and things that didn't happen, we reduced contractors and obviously, those costs, as things normalize and things come back, obviously, we'll get to traveling again, we'll get to the trade shows and the contractor costs will come back as the growth comes back as well. So -- but there is an element of -- again, if I look at just purely the organic business, there's an element of improved profitability there, again, 25% in a quarter and a part of that's coming from the $20 million we took out early in the year.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just continuing on the $30 million in costs -- in extra kind of COVID-related cost savings, how much of that was in the run rate in the 2Q numbers? And how much of that will kind of start to flow through into 3Q? Is it about 50-50? Or is it mostly kind of baked in the run rate right now?
Scott Behrens: I think Q2 is probably a pretty good indicator. Again, it has the full amount that we took out early in the year, and we actioned the $30 million pretty quickly. And if we look at the course of the year, Q2 probably had the biggest impact because a lot of things really kind of, I don't want to say they came to a halt, but certainly things like travel and a lot of the trade shows and things just really stopped. And so the benefit of that in our P&L, we saw a lot of that benefit in Q2. Obviously, as we -- in Q3 and Q4, when we start to see travel pick up, those costs will start to come back a bit. But I think Q2 is a good indicator of the full amount of cost benefit for a 90-day period. And the only other thing I'd go back to on, you mentioned, you're focused more on the gross margin in your question. Remember, on the biller side of the business, there's interchange cost with that revenue. So when I said the revenue declined in Q2 on the tax side of $16 million, there's a pretty sizable interchange cost that goes with that. And so cost -- that's in the cost of goods sold. So we really have less of an impact as a company at the net revenue level and the EBITDA level as a result of that -- those tax payments moving out.
Kyle Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess last one for me, and then I'll step back from the queue. But just wanted to get -- the services revenue came in a bit later than our expectation, is there anything noisy going along there? Or is it just a little less demand during COVID? Just want to try to get a sense of when we might see some signs of stabilization there?
Scott Behrens: I wouldn't say anything in particular noisy. I mean, we were able to continue projects during the last 90 days. If you look at our new bookings, we had more new bookings in the quarter in On Demand. And we actually saw a decline in On Premise. On Premise is where we would see the sales related to services work. So there's obviously a drop-off in the On Premise business in terms of services sales, and that will impact Q2. It may impact us a little more in the second half, but nothing other than that. It's not -- there's a change in terms of what we're doing in terms of our services portfolio. I would say part of it's COVID and part of it's just the lower sales in the quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes the line of George Sutton of Craig-Hallum.
George Sutton: So we attended an interesting webinar you guys hosted about real-time payments with one of the key themes really being that real-time is going to be accelerated. When does this become a revenue driver in your view in the U.S.? Does it remain sort of a European-centric factor? And how would you quantify the near-term addressable market?
Scott Behrens: Well, maybe I'll take that, and then Odilon can add some color. Obviously, the biggest growth we've seen in real-time is outside the U.S., but -- and that's both on new logos as well as add-ons to selling our real-time capability to our existing customer base. And we mentioned an Asian customer that purchased real-time this quarter, that was revenue in quarter, that was an On Premise sale. So that converts pretty quickly. But most of the growth has come from overseas. Obviously, our U.S. banks are -- we're selling that in addition when we -- especially when we go on with renewals, but in terms of a real tipping point in the U.S., I'm not sure when that will be. But certainly, a lot of our growth and the 20-plus percent growth that we've seen over the last few years, a lot of that's really coming from overseas.
Odilon Almeida: I think just to complement, Scott. I think also, we saw bookings are growing 60% plus, right? So that shows you the trend. We are very much focused behind real-time payments, and that will be one of our pillars. It will continue to be one of our pillars of growth. It already represents more than 10% of our revenue. So it's significant. And also the other place that you can expect a lot of growth is emerging markets outside of U.S. and Europe. So I think very much real time around the globe and specifically, emerging markets.
George Sutton: Just to clarify, did you say bookings for real time grew 60%? Or are you saying...
Odilon Almeida: Yes, 60%.
Scott Behrens: Yes, 60%. Yes, in a quarter. Yes,
George Sutton: And then quick follow-up. So you picked up on Visa Mastercard and some others expanding Click to Pay to 18 new countries. Can you talk about that a bit, sort of how are you involved? And could that be a meaningful volume and revenue opportunity?
Scott Behrens: Well, we wouldn't speak to anything in particular with any of our customers or any of our partners in terms of -- obviously, we're heavily involved both going direct in real-time initiatives and also working via our partnership with Mastercard already and the VocaLink partnership that we have.
Odilon Almeida: Yes, I think you can expect a lot of activity, always behind real-time payments and that we may compare with alliances, that we may compare just going by ourselves, but it will be a clear area of focus for us.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff: Two questions from me. I'll ask them both, and then I'll get off. One is really good bookings quarter. Surprisingly to us, just given that we had seen some bank kind of pause spending. I think you said you had a couple of merchant deals in there, but wondering if you could give us an update on what banks you're looking at buying and kind of their tenure of how they're thinking about spending? And then number two, I think you highlighted a little bit some of your initiatives that you're going to start working on. I think sales execution and maybe sales reorganization was one of them. Can you just tell us a little bit more about that and kind of when we should maybe start seeing some of the fruits of that .
Scott Behrens: Maybe, Odilon, I'll take the first one. The new bookings growth in the quarter up 6% year-over-year. In a COVID quarter, that's probably pretty good. Q2 is not typically our strongest bookings quarter in fairness. But like I said, we had a lot more growth. We had a high growth in the On Demand business. We actually saw a decline in the On Premise business. But the growth we saw was actually -- most of it really wasn't from banks. Our 2 biggest net new logos, one was a biller customer and the other was our secure eCommerce solution, so Merchant solution. And then our biggest add-on was in real time. So a lot of the growth we saw in the quarter was from billers, merchants and then as Odilon mentioned, the real time up 65%.
Odilon Almeida: Yes. I think...
Scott Behrens: I wouldn't necessarily say that that's an indicator that banks aren't spending. But I'm just saying for the quarter, that's where we really saw our growth.
Odilon Almeida: Yes. I think, Brett, we did see, as Scott said, some impact on, On Premise, no bookings. So clearly, there are some clients that are delaying the decision yet. So that's consistent to what you heard before. Just our On Demand business did wonderfully. And that's what offset on the total bookings part. So -- and we would expect that, that trend on the On Premise will continue as far as it's a timing issue only because our products are, as you know, mission critical. So it's a question of time when we're going to be able to sign those clients. But yes, there is some impact on that that's consistent to what you have been seeing. So I think that's the first question. The second one on the execution, I'm just going to give you some data that we are working with our consultants and internal team today. In sales, for example, in the sales organization, we are going to centralize the sales organization. We are hiring a Chief Revenue Officer. I think we are going to have announcement as soon as next week about the name of that Chief Revenue Officer. And by centralizing that, just to give you an idea how agile or nimble we're going to be, you can expect 3 levels of management between the CEO and the sales rep around the globe. So that gives an idea about the kind of change that we're going to be doing and how agile we're going to be. And together with that, we are revising everything. We're revising how we build compensation, how we manage the pipeline, how we evaluate the pipeline, detail by detail, all that. So you can expect, again, a very nimble, agile organization with decision power really in the field. And we have a strong process behind it.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Peter Heckmann of Davidson.
Peter Heckmann: I just wanted to see if you could provide us any insight into the ongoing process of some of the larger contract expansions in the pipeline and if you have any thoughts on timing there?
Scott Behrens: Yes. I mean, we -- I think we said earlier this year that we were -- just to be clear, we weren't expecting any of those or forecast any of those in this year's guidance. But obviously, we continue to have conversations with our customers and even net new logos on a large new opportunity. So nothing that I would say we're expecting here before the end of the year.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. I guess, one of my understanding was that when a customer goes through a large merger, they need to renegotiate the contract with ACI before they can consolidate their payment operations, is that not the case?
Scott Behrens: Well, no. I would say it's generally the case because the license is very specific to the contracting user, and they're -- it's very specific to the uses. So if they were to actually expand that use to other parts of their operation, acquired operation, then, yes, it would have to be recontracted. I will point out that and we mentioned this earlier in the year, too, one of the large mergers, they actually executed their renewal early. If you recall, it was a renewal from next year. They actually renewed it back in the first half of this year. So they've recommitted to the next 5 years. Now that is what -- specifically what they're using today. So it's not an expanded deal, but it's a recommitment to our technology for the next 5 years and that was suppose to renew next year.
Peter Heckmann: Okay. All right. And then, Odilon, just a question for you. I mean, do you see kind of the mix, the customer mix shifting at all in your outlook in terms of where you see opportunities from U.S. banks, global banks, emerging markets, increasing importance of the Merchant channel? Can you talk a little bit about how you see that maybe relatively more of the sales coming from which of those verticals over the next three years?
Odilon Almeida: Yes. No, thanks for the question. You can expect a much more focused organization going forward. So we have some pillars to accelerate significantly. One of the pillars will be real-time payment, and that will continue to be accelerated. Part of it is already the 60% plus growth in bookings that we have referred to. And we are going to continue to push that big time. I think the other area of focus definitely that you're going to be seeing is emerging markets. We are defining a concept called Fighting Unit, which is the intersection between geography, product and segment. And you're going to have around 20 Fighting Units around the globe that we're going to be investing heavily behind it. If you put all of that together, I can anticipate to you that real-time payments, overall, it's going to be an area of focus and emerging markets, specifically, will be also an area of focus.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi of Canaccord.
Joseph Vafi: Just a follow-up on the real-time deals in the quarter, the Indonesian bank and Rabo. Just to get a feel for how competitive are these types of situations for, I guess, for new customers, I guess, especially on the real-time front? And then secondly, do you think we see M&A before -- during or -- I guess, I know you're going through some organizational changes. Does M&A come after the organizational changes are done or could we see M&A while things are still being optimized here?
Odilon Almeida: I will start with the last one, and then I'll give the first one to Scott. I think we are always looking at M&A, right? We're always like -- I have deals on my table that comes all the time, and we are always looking to that. My very -- my focus now is really organic growth. I think we will need to start and show this organic growth and M&A could happen. Why we are doing this? If we get like a spectacular accretive option. But at this point, my focus and organization focus is to assure that we position the company for continuous profitable growth. Scott?
Scott Behrens: Yes. I think when it comes to the real time, we have the relationships with the largest banks in the world and have for a long time with our retail payment engine. So in a lot of cases, we're natural to provide the real-time capability. So a lot of our success is coming just selling into that existing base, whether it's a new application or expanding on some of the real-time capabilities that we already have. So on the net new logo, that's probably going to be more in, what I'd call, more the central infrastructure, where they can either procure it as a licensed software, which is really our model, or if they want somebody to operate it, that's typically going to be provided by somebody else. And so I would say, probably more competitive in the central infrastructures. But in terms of the connectivity to those central infrastructures, we're just a natural fit with our existing large bank customer base throughout the world.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to John for any closing or additional comments.
John Kraft: Well, thanks, everybody, for dialing in and your interest. We look forward to catching up in the following weeks. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.";[0.11690098545909855, 0.12794184310447365];0.12794184310447365;0.11690098545909855;0
15;ACIW;2021-02-27;"Company Representatives: Odilon Almeida - President, Chief Executive Officer Scott Behrens - Chief Financial Officer
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you and good morning everyone. Today's call like all of our events is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. You can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the SEC.  On this morning's call is Odilon Almeida, our President and CEO; and Scott Behrens, our CFO. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Odilon.
Odilon Almeida: Thank you, John. Hello everyone! And thank you for joining our call. When we discussed our preliminary 2020 results in January, I shared my excitement about our strong performance and reinforced my confidence in the significant value creation potential of ACI. Today, we will provide you with a more detailed update on the 2020 results, 2021 outlook and growth initiatives. 
Scott Behrens: Thanks Odilon and good morning everyone. I first plan to go through our financial results for 2020 and then provide some additional commentary regarding our outlook for 2021. We will then open the line for questions.  For the full year 2020 total bookings were up 21%, while new bookings were up 36% compared to 2019. New bookings in our On Demand business more than doubled over last year, while new bookings in our On Premise license software business declined, primarily due to COVID related delays and purchasing decisions by our bank customers, which impacted significantly our license fee revenues.  2020 revenue was $1.29 billion, up 3% from 2019, largely due to having a full year of Speedpay results, offset by declines in non-recurring license fee revenue. Recurring revenue grew 10%, significantly above the total company revenue growth and now represents 76% of total revenue in 2020, up from 71% in 2019. 
Odilon Almeida: Thanks Scott. In closing, we are pleased with the company's performance in 2020 and look forward to continuing our momentum in 2021. We are well positioned to advance our three-pillar strategy and we are confident that we will continue to excel within our new organizational structure and increased focus on our higher growing areas.  In parallel, we are actively looking into investments and divestitures to maximize our growth profile and deliver transformational long-term value to our shareholders. I look forward to update you on our progress. We are now happy to take your questions. Thank you.
Operator:  We have our first question from the line of Mr. Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Brett Huff: Good morning, guys. How are you?
Scott Behrens: Good morning.
Odilon Almeida: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Huff: Just a couple of questions; number one, congrats on the Mastercard joint win. I think it was Peru or somewhere in Latin America. Can you just give us – unpack that a little bit? You know how did the sales process go? Was it competitive? Kind of what got you guys over the finish line from a decision point of view?
Scott Behrens: Yeah, well to answer that, yeah, it is Peru. We had announced last summer that more enhanced partnership with Mastercard, and in particular, really targeting a specific list of countries to go to market on a joint effort, and that's really a product of that, that partnership that we announced last summer. So it's obviously getting early traction and we're really confident in that.
Odilon Almeida: Yeah, Brett, it’s basically the national switch and Mastercard is going to operate and we are going to be the software, so that's the summary of it.
Brett Huff: And so this is where you guys are doing most of the bank on ramp stuff, whereas Mastercard is doing the central hub. Is that kind of the division of labor?
Odilon Almeida: Correct, correct.
Brett Huff: Okay, that's helpful. Second question is just on the guidance. I think you guys said accelerating to mid-single digits in the back half. You had mentioned sort of mid-single digits I think over the next three years at the Analyst Day. Is that a little bit of a shift or we’re just feeling a little bit longer COVID negative impact in the first half? Is that what's going on or am I misreading that communication?
Odilon Almeida: Yeah, no Brett, we don't believe it's a shift. We continue to have the same guidance of before, we continue under COVID-19 as you just said, so there is impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter, no question about that. I mean nothing changed versus the Q4 quarter, so we continue to see our banks, you know delaying decisions on license revenue basically, so that's the only effect that we see. 
Brett Huff: Okay, that's helpful. And then last one, on the strategic review, any preview on that? I think you mentioned reviewing the portfolio, but kind of how broad or narrow is that? Just give us – you know I don't know how much you can say. I know there is an 8-K probably coming out soon, but just what are the kind of parameters of that, if you could give us any qualitative thoughts on it?
Odilon Almeida: It's very broad. I mean, we are – and that's what the third pillar is about, right. So there is no news here. I mean we – since the beginning we said that the third pillar is to provide step change value creation to our shareholders through M&A. That could be through divestiture of no strategic assets or buying some assets also in a highly accretive way and we continue to do that. So it's very broad and continues to be very broad, so.
Brett Huff: Okay, great. That's what I needed. I appreciate the time guys.
Scott Behrens: Sure. Thanks Brett.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann from Davidson. Your line is now open.
Peter Heckmann: Good morning, gentlemen. Nice results in the fourth quarter. I wanted to see how you're thinking about both the renewal pipeline for 2021, as well as new business? If you can talk about where you might be seeing some RFP activity on a country basis or a large financial institution basis that we should be keeping in mind?
Scott Behrens: Yes, I'd say you know it’s somewhat similar comments I made in my prepared remarks you know. Even with 2020, it wasn't really the renewal book that was the issue. You know we have a solid renewal book in 2021. I would say really where we're seeing the growth opportunity is really going to come as those banks pick up spending in the second half of the year and what I'm referring to there is more the net new sales versus existing renewals. That was really where we fell short in 2020.  It was again not in renewals, but in net new spend, whether new logos or cross-sell of new applications. That's where we see in our pipeline this year that picking up, and that's going to allow us here in the second half of the year to get to deliver our long-term targets of mid-single digit.
Odilon Almeida: Yes Peter, being in calls with the CEO of banks here in the United States, in Singapore. I was in meetings in Brazil also with some CEOs of some banks. And what I can tell you is that I start to see light in the tunnel for the second half of this year. So they start to talk about the projects that they will not talk anymore about modernization, about going to the cloud. So I'm positive, I'm optimistic about the second half of the year. I think things will get more to a normal state business wise by the second half of this year.
Peter Heckmann: That's great, that's great. And then can you just talk about the interplay and maybe in some of the countries that already have real-time payments, the interplay between kind of more traditional biller direct bill pay and then real time payments? Maybe how much of the payment volume has shifted over to a direct account-to-account payment versus a card-based payments?
Odilon Almeida: I can tell you for example we have – I will give an example, because it becomes more real. I guess Brazil, the picks in Brazil right, I mean that has just been launched and is already like making like 5 million accounts already, like a few months. So when it starts, it starts very fast.  So there are basically three ways around the globe for payments right, and all the others are variances of these three ways. You can have physical cash; you can have cards or you can have real time payments. And what we expect going forward is that cash will continue to be stable and going down a little bit, and cards is not going to be growing as much as they have been growing in the past right, 20% plus, it's going to slow down a little bit. But the bulk of the growth has really been real-time payments and that's what we're seeing. It's a much more effective, efficient way and that's why everybody’s looking to that and that's why it's the center of our strategy.
Peter Heckmann: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Mr. George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
George Sutton: Thank you, and first my congratulations on your being responsive to shareholders with the upcoming Board adds. I think that's going to be well received.  I wanted to ask and maybe it's , but also in your script and in the press release you talked about long-term shareholder appreciation, and as you may know, given the history, long-term has always been an amorphous kind of an item, and I wanted to look at that up against Odilon your weekly sprints that you run in the business. Just to understand the sense of timing that everybody has in this whole process? Thanks.
Odilon Almeida: Yes, I know, and thank you George for that question, because you just – I think there is a flaw in the script, because we communicated I think the wrong thing. We are here for the short-term, for the middle-term and for the long-term. So it's value creation now, its value creation also in the long-term, and I think the most important proof for it is we are going to achieve the rule of 40 for the first time this year.  So after you know nine months, now it’s one year almost that I've been in company. This is going to be the first year ever that the company will achieve the rule of 40, so – and that creates value to shareholders, right. I mean immediate revenue to shareholders. So yeah, so great catch George. So we did about short, medium and long-term.
George Sutton: Alright, I really appreciate that clarification. Relative to your divestitures, you're talking about the slower growing areas, as you're increasing your investment in the faster growing areas, I'm just curious, how are you thinking of the investment of those areas that may or may not be targeted for a potential sale?
Odilon Almeida: Yeah. So basically you have areas on high growth, you have areas that are important for us, like billers and issuing and acquiring, that are not going to be growing by double-digits, but we will be growing by mid digits, by close to mid digits and we call protect and grow, and we have other divesture areas that we are looking to now, assets that are not strategic. So it is a fine balance on protecting the core areas, but releasing funds to invest heavily on the high areas.  Just to give you more color about that George, last year through bank we went through the first, I would say zero-base exercise of the company here, and they are real zero based. I was on top of it. Scott was very much close to it and with zero based investments of the company and we came from that point to see, ‘okay, what do we really need?’ And that's why by that time we were able to find $60 million this year and $75 million next year that we were able to reinvest in the business part of it and part of it I give it to bottom line, so. 
George Sutton: Perfect! I appreciate the thoughts.
Scott Behrens: Thanks George.
Odilon Almeida: Thanks George.
Operator:  There are no questions at this time sir. You may now proceed. Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, thanks everybody for joining us. We look forward to catching up with everybody in the coming weeks. Have a good day!
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.";[0.012705123286011366, -0.010584069979518995];-0.010584069979518995;0.012705123286011366;1
16;ACLS;2017-05-08;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company's results for the First Quarter of 2017. My name is Terrence, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Terrence. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you've not seen a copy of our press release issued earlier today, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's safe harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations, and we do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today, Axcelis reported first quarter 2017 financial results. Revenues for the quarter were $86.9 million with gross margins at 40% and earnings per share of $0.29. Our systems mix in the quarter was 67% mature foundry logic and 33% memory. Both market segments continued to be strong, driven by data storage applications and the Internet of Things. The geographic mix of our system shipments was Korea 43%, China 37%, U.S. and Europe 13% and the rest of the world 7%. Chinese market activity is currently driven by mature technologies supporting IoT devices. We expect memory activity in China to begin in 2018. Purion products continued to gain momentum during the quarter. In Q1, Purion accounted for 93% of our systems revenue. We placed Purion products in seven new fabs. This included 3 customers who bought Purion products for the first time and 4 Purion systems that were first in fab tools at existing customers. Also, today, we shipped the 100 Purion system, a significant milestone for Axcelis. Our business outlook remains positive. In the second quarter, we are forecasting revenues of approximately $100 million, gross margins of approximately 38%, operating income of $12 million to $13 million, and EPS of $0.30 to $0.35. Our total cash should increase significantly to approximately $100 million. In the second quarter, we expect a system mix of approximately 40% mature foundry and logic and 60% memory. For the full year, we expect the system segment split to be weighted toward the mature process technology market. In 2017, we still expect our market share to increase to between 22% and 28%, driving total company revenues within a range of $320 million and $380 million. We expect to provide an update to this range in July at SEMICON West. As we discussed in our last earnings call, we plan to invest more aggressively to grow revenues, to capitalize on strong market conditions. This will include incremental investment in R&D to develop additional Purion product extensions targeted at specific customer requirements. We will also selectively invest in SG&A to address our growing customer base, especially in China, and to expand our reach into leading edge logic customers and the Japanese market. Demo activity at our Advanced Technology Center in Beverly, Massachusetts is very strong, with both new and existing customers investigating emerging applications and novel products. We expect this increased demo activity will lead to additional customer evaluations and further penetrations. This activity is key to achieving our long-term target business model. The 3 key assumptions in our model are: a strong foundation built on continued strength in the mature process technology segment and our Service business; a robust memory cycle, driven by sustained NAND activity and cyclical strength in the DRAM market; and growth from new opportunities, including the Chinese memory market, penetrations into leading edge logic and reentry into the Japanese market. Before Kevin reviews the details of our first quarter financials, I would like to reiterate our 4 key objectives for 2017. First, we will focus on new customer penetrations with Purion. The expanding number of customers investing in IoT, 3D NAND in China has broadened the CapEx opportunity, providing new prospects for Axcelis. Second, we will also drive to grow our share of business at existing customers as they increase their capacity in 2017; third, we will focus our marketing and engineering resources on enhancing Purion and on developing additional product extensions to drive revenue. And fourth, we will execute against detailed gross margin improvement programs. Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. In Q1, we delivered solid financial results, driven by our higher system sales and strong gross margin performance of 40%. Gross margin in the quarter was fueled by a favorable mix of Purion XE, Purion product extensions, and a higher percentage of revenue from the mature process technology segment. System margin improvement continues to be driven by a strong focus on Purion value engineering, supply chain optimization and factory-lean programs. Since volume ramp of a full Purion product line in Q1 of 2015, system-standard margins have increased 1,240 basis points on a rolling 4 quarter average. Improving Purion maturity, platform commonality and product line extensions are also contributing to higher gross margins. In Q2, we expect gross margins to be approximately 38% based on product and segment mix. As we have discussed many times, gross margins can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of product and service mix, segment mix and a timing of the evaluation to a recognition. With a strong diversified market anticipated in 2017, we've seen opportunity to firmly establish Purion across a broader customer base. To ensure we capture these opportunities, we expect to continue to support new evaluation tools for our Purion product line. We're also investing and updating some of our core business systems and adding headcount and infrastructure to capture the fast-growing Chinese market. China represents a significant opportunity for us, especially in our core markets of memory and mature process technologies. In fact, 3 of our 7 new customer placements this quarter were in China. Finally, we are developing additional Purion product line extensions, which we expect will capture new opportunities and help drive gross margins. As a result of these planned investments and increased variable compensation, we expect our combined SG&A and R&D to be approximately $26 million in Q2, which I believe will be our peak spending level for the year. I expect full year spending to average approximately $25 million per quarter. At this point, we are aggressively pursuing revenue growth during the strong period of expansion in the semiconductor industry. I believe the incremental spending is needed to capture opportunities we have targeted. That being said, I will continue to tightly manage expenses as I had in the past to ensure they are aligned with revenue growth and gross margin improvement and objectives. Now I'll review the first quarter financial results. In Q1, we finished above guidance and above consensus estimates across the board. Q1 revenue finished $86.9 million compared to $69.4 million in Q4. Q1 system sales were $55.3 million compared to $37.7 million in Q4. Q1 CS&I revenue finished at $31.6 million compared to $31.7 million in Q4. Q1 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for about 85% of our total sales compared to 80% in Q4, with 4 of these customers at 10% or above. Q1 system bookings were $97.2 million compared to $34.8 million in Q4, with a Q1 book-to-bill ratio of 1.71 versus 0.88 in Q4. Backlog in Q1 finished at $48.2 million compared to $17.5 million in Q4. Q1 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $24 million compared to $21.1 million in Q4. SG&A in the quarter was $14.1 million, with R&D at $9.9 million. In the second quarter, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be around $26 million, which includes a previously discussed investment and variable compensation expenses. Gross margin in Q1 finished at 40% compared to 38.9% in Q4. In Q2, we expect gross margins to be approximately 38%, down slightly, due to product and segment mix. Operating profit in Q1 was $10.7 million compared to $5.9 million in Q4. Q1 net income was $9.5 million or $0.29 per share compared to $4 million or $0.13 per share in Q4. Q1 inventory ended at $115.6 million compared to $113.9 million in Q4. Inventory turns, excluding evaluations, finished at 2.1 compared to 1.6 in Q4. Q1 accounts payable were $26.4 million compared to $25 million in Q4. Q1 receivables was $67.1 million compared to $50.6 million in Q4. Q1 total cash finished at $76.2 million compared to $77.7 million in Q4. We expect Q2 total cash to finish significantly higher at approximately $100 million. Overall, I'm very pleased with our financial performance in Q1. Purion sales drove significantly higher systems revenue and strong gross margin performance provided solid operating profits. We continue to execute to our cost out roadmaps, which is moving system gross margins higher, and we continued to penetrate new accounts of Purion products as shown by the 7 new customers we gained in Q1. And finally, in case I need to say it again, I will be closely watching our expenses and looking for ways to cut cost. But now is the time to take advantage of the strong market, and invest a little more to capture new customers and gain market share. I will now turn the call back to Mary for her closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. The industry is in a period of unusually strong growth, driven by the growing IoT and data storage markets. During this period, Axcelis' revenue growth will be the result of broader customer base, increased spending in both the memory and mature process technology segment, and penetration of the leading-edge logic segment and Japanese market. Our gross margin improvement initiatives remain on track, and our costs are controlled and aligned with our revenue growth objectives. Axcelis has provided our customers with a strong alternative in ion implant. And as they have come to know Purion, they are choosing Axcelis. As I highlighted last quarter, they choose Axcelis for several reasons. Advanced technology is first on the list. The Purion product family provides them significant advantages in angle dose and energy control, derived from our scanned spot beam technology. The common Purion end station and ELS4 Source provide them cost of ownership advantages. Second, our focus on customer-specific applications provides them with implant solutions tailored for their needs. Finally, there is the innovation benefit, which by promoting competition, allows customers to gain significant technology advances and engineering expertise. Customers measure the innovation benefit through improvements in productivity, yield and cost of ownership. They maximize this benefit by splitting their business evenly between 2 strong implant suppliers. We believe that with Purion, we are poised to take advantage of this strong market and deliver on our target business model, yielding attractive earnings for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley Financials. Your line is open.
Craig Ellis: Congratulations on the very good execution to start 2017. The first is just a clarification on the first quarter's results. The first quarter revenues were about $7 million or 8.9% above what was expected about 3 months ago. Can you help us understand where the business wound up being stronger, versus early year expectations?
Mary Puma: So what we found as we moved through the quarter is that there was increased or increasing strength from both the memory market as well as the mature process technology segment. In particular, we saw some additional strength coming from DRAM as certain customers transitioned through a technology shrink. So those are mainly the 2 areas.
Craig Ellis: And was that multi-customers? Or just a single customer on DRAM?
Mary Puma: It was a single customer.
Craig Ellis: Okay. And then, switching to the longer-term dynamics with revenue. Thanks for giving us a view on the full year. I had a couple of questions related to that. I'll try and tie it all together. So at a $320 million to $380 million range for the year from the second quarter's guidance for $100 million, the low end of the range would be down 22% half on half, the high end of the range would be plus 11%. The midpoint's down about 5%. Can you help us understand the factors that would either result in a low end of range outcome for Axcelis, or a high end of range outcome for Axcelis?
Mary Puma: So at this point in time, we're only guiding one quarter, given the fact that our customers continuously make changes in the timing of their investments. That's, and we did say that in 2017 our revenues were going to be between those goalposts of $320 million and $380 million. At this point in time that's really as much color as we're going to give on guidance. But we will update the revenue range in July in SEMICON West. That said, we feel very good about the dynamics of the market. And we believe the semiconductor industry is in an unusual period of growth. NAND continues to be strong, based on end-use market drivers, and those drivers would imply that the market will remain strong into next year. DRAM pricing is currently holding, which is a good sign. But the spending will be metered based on the timing of shrinks and competitive pressures along the DRAM makers to invest. And then, IoT investment is also robust around the world, particularly in China and Europe. And again, we expect that to continue into next year. So at this point, the market dynamics seem to continue to be strong. But again, given where we are today, we're just not going to give any additional guidance out through 2017.
Craig Ellis: Fair enough. I'll take my last one with Kevin, and then I'll jump back in. Kevin, can you just clarify, were there any evaluation tools rev rec-ed in 1Q? And what's the assumption in 2Q's 38% gross margin?
Kevin Brewer: So there were not any tools recognized in Q1. What we're expecting, in the second quarter, Craig, is that if you look at the mix of both the products and kind of the segment, that's where we're seeing a little bit of change in gross margins. In the investor pitch, we have that slide that highlights the differences, really, between the three products, between the HCM and EXE. And its really just movement in that $100 million revenue range in terms of the products that are filling in there. So that's why we're down slightly. As we've been talking about full year, margins are continuing to improve. We've got a lot of initiatives in place, we're making good progress on them. So I think the key takeaway is we're continuing to lower the cost of our products. So we're going to continue to improve the margins across each product. And the thing that will move us from quarter to quarter will be the mix of those products, and potentially, whether does an eval recognize or not in a quarter.
Craig Ellis: Okay. That's helpful. But just one follow up to that though. There's no doubt the company is making very good progress on a number of underlying drivers to gross margin. But I think on last call, the company noted that there would be potentially 3 or 4 evaluation tools rev rec-ed this year. So does the first half commentary mean that, there's 3 or 4 tools to rev rec in the second half? Or is there a different view at this time?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So we have, Craig, we have several eval tools out there right now. And we will have additional tools going out. Some of these will close out before the new tools go out, but we actually are going to have some additional tools out there, increasing the total numbers before things start closing out. Most of those tools are planned in the Q2 through Q4 time period. So they're kind of scattered throughout the year, how it is right now.
Craig Ellis: Got it. Thanks Kevin.
Kevin Brewer: Yes thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Arthur Su: This is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Mary, maybe just to kick things off with you. I know you're not ready to provide second half commentary, but just based upon what you're seeing now versus 3 months ago. How would you characterize any shift in your view on the second half? Are you seeing better sentiment around memory? Is mature logic looking a little bit better? Any color there would be helpful.
Mary Puma: While I don't know that we've necessarily seen any significant change in the year over the last several months. I did mention that we saw an uptick in DRAM. But we all know that in the DRAM -- DRAM tends to be very cyclical, and it's just really a function of when some of our customers are either going to shrink, or as I said before, for competitive reasons, decide that they need to make investments to keep up with their friends so to speak. So that's something that we're just going to have to watch very closely. For us, though, there really hasn't been any change in what we see in either the NAND market or the Internet of Things. And I think even at our last call, we were very, I'll use the word bullish, on the mature process technology segment. It's actually, as we said, accounted for a significant portion of our systems revenue, although it was less than 50%. In the first quarter, it will shift to be a stronger percentage of our systems revenue as we move throughout the year. So we're still feeling very good about things, and we're still very confident about the dynamics that we're seeing in the market. As I said, we're just really not positioned to give any guidance any further out than Q2.
Arthur Su: No. I understand. And then, I think, in the past, you've talked about material modification as an area of opportunity for Axcelis to penetrate leading-edge foundry logic. Can you provide an update on any progress in this effort? Or when we can start to think about this as a driver for Axcelis business?
Douglas Lawson: Well, Arthur, this is Doug. We've got a lot of activity, as Mary mentioned in the script, in the demo area. A lot of that is with leading logic customers in general. Leading-edge logic customers are focused on material modification. So again, the Purion H and the capabilities of the spot beam and several other capabilities that the tool has, are the things that are driving the demo activity. The fact that the tool now is installed in a lot of places running both memory and trailing as logic, is giving them much more confidence to be able to come in and look at the tool for production. So as we've said in the past, we think, we will penetrate leading-edge logic over the next 12 to 18 months, and somewhere in the 7 to 5 nanometer node. And it's likely to be on a material modification application.
Arthur Su: Got it. Thanks for that color. And then, Kevin, maybe moving on to you. You had previously outlined a target of achieving 4% gross margin by the end of 2017, and I know you provided some color to a previous question on the put and takes for gross margin. But given that you've delivered that goal, essentially, on 1Q and you think about the progress you made on driving lower cost. Is it fair to say that there could be a potential for upside to that 40% target?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So I'm at, at this point in time, I think all I can say is that we're going to continue to make progress. And depending how the mix lands from quarter-to-quarter, I think that's going to be, that's going to really determine what number is in front of this. You can see the impact in Q2 goes down a little bit. It's not because our cost has increased it's really because of the mix. So it's a little difficult to predict what Q4 is going to be at this point in time. And we certainly have a mix in front of us, but a lot's going to move. So again, I think what's important is we're continuing to drive lower cost, and we're making a lot of gains with the initiatives we have in place.
Mary Puma: And the target business models haven't changed.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. I mean, yes. So I mean, that's a good point. I mean, target business models hasn't changed. In the investor presentation that's going up on the web today, and it might be already up. We've updated our models. So we've got some gross margin ranges in there, along with operating expense ranges versus revenue ranges. So we haven't changed what we're doing for this year, I guess, what I would say.
Operator: And our next question come from Christian Schwab from Craig-Hallum.
Christian Schwab: Great quarter guys. Great guide. I haven't had the chance, so I just pulled up here quick on the website. But are you still thinking that kind of in the 1.5, 2-year time frame that we can drive $460-plus million of business and $2.80 in earnings? Is that still our more longer-term objective?
Mary Puma: That's, the models that we have in our investor presentation are models that we believe, we can achieve at the minimum. They are certainly target models that we are targeting for. So we definitely believe they're within our sights.
Douglas Lawson: So Christian, we've updated the model this quarter, and basically, we've given a little more visibility looking out longer. So now you'll see a column that's for $450 million, and one for $550 million in revenue, and the appropriate gross margins and percent OpEx and so forth.
Christian Schwab: All right. Excellent. Thanks for the, for added clarity. I think the rest of the questions I had have already been answered.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Chin from Stifel.
Brian Chin: Mary, first, I'd be a little surprised that the implant market is growing 20% to 40% year-on-year. So it would be helpful if you could discuss what you currently think the baseline growth rate for the overall ion implant market will be in 2017?
Douglas Lawson: Yes. Brian, this is Doug. I'm not sure where you're getting the number of the implant market growing. The implant market this year is up from around $850 million last year to $950 million. We expect to grow, in 2018, to around $1 billion. And so the growth is coming from a couple of places. One, is new wafer starts in 3D NAND is certainly driving it, and the activity in China. So in addition to the normal flow that you will get as companies are expanding their capacity, we've got a lot of new customers. And then, the IoT is driving implants, a lot of upgrades of existing older implanters in those fabs. And so that's really where the growth comes. But it's still -- it's a $1 billion-or-so plus or minus market.
Brian Chin: Okay. Great. Yes, I was just using the math that Mary provided for the range of revenues this year. And saying that, obviously, that you'd have to chalk the difference up to market share gains.
Douglas Lawson: Oh. Yes -- no. The market -- we are -- yes, it's all market share gains. Yes.
Mary Puma: Yes.
Brian Chin: Great. And could you also provide any rough parameters on what the DRAM versus NAND? What was DRAM versus NAND driven in the quarter? And how you might expect this to trend in Q2 and into the back half of the year?
Mary Puma: So if you take a look at the technology breakout for our shipments in Q1, memory accounted for about 33% and it was almost evenly split between DRAM and Flash. It was 16% DRAM, 18% or 17% Flash. So that was the breakout. And then, if I look at our bookings, although, again, we've always talked about how our bookings tend to be the same book and ship in the same quarter. Again, very evenly split in terms of what we booked in Q1, it was about 21% -- it was 21% DRAM and 21% Flash. So I think that just gives you some sense that, as I said before, the DRAM was actually much stronger and kind of caught up with our expectations for NAND during the quarter.
Douglas Lawson: And Brian, I guess, as far as the second half goes, we can't give anything more than the break down that we gave, which is that we think the mature technologies will be a little bit ahead of the memory technologies in terms of the segment mix for the full year. So we see the, the first quarter and the second quarter are almost inverse of each other. And then -- but it ends up pretty balanced at the end.
Brian Chin: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Maybe playing off of that for a moment. You've talked in the past about implant applications for things like image sensors, silicon carbide power devices as nice growth opportunities for Purion EXE and Purion M. Both of these markets seem to be on pretty solid footing. Can you discuss how material these revenues are currently? And -- or could be later in the year?
Douglas Lawson: Well, both of those fall into our mature markets -- our mature process technology categories, which typically have been roughly half of our revenues the last couple of years, and basically, will be again this year. The image censor piece of that is reasonably significant in that almost every foundry in the world wants to be able to have the capability to build image sensors, and that requires high energy tools. The power device market is a little bit more of a specialty market. There's a smaller number of players, but it is a really nice -- good margin opportunity for us in the Purion M area.
Brian Chin: Thanks so much.
Douglas Lawson: Thanks Mike.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Duley from Steelhead Securities.
David Duley: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple. When you look at your sequential guidance into Q2, I think you got, like, roughly $14 million of an improvement in revenue. Could you help us understand and you've kind of already answered, but help us understand of that $14 million, where a majority of that incremental revenue is headed? I guess it's probably towards the memory market from what your characterizations were. But also curious if you can, like, talk about on the product front, if it's Purion M and Hs? Or if it's the XEs and the other product line extensions that are accounting for a majority of the incremental revenue growth?
Mary Puma: Yes. So I mean, we're not going to give you exact numbers, but there continues to be both the mature process technology as well as memory spending into Q2. And it's really a mix of all three types of Purion products that we're shipping. We've had a lot of success recently with the Purion M, particularly for some specialty applications with hot silicon carbide, the high-energy market has been extremely hot, not only for memory, but also for image sensors. And then, the Purion H is actually going into both markets that we serve as well, memory and mature process technology. So right now what we're seeing is we're seeing strong markets across market segments and geographies, Dave.
David Duley: Just let me follow up before you give a little bit more color there. Clearly, the biggest part of the market is the Purion H, right? So in order to take a lot of market share, I would imagine, you have to see incremental shipments in that segment of the market. Maybe I'm wrong. But maybe, just talk about, are you achieving, do you think you're achieving your goals in the segments of the markets as you thought you would as far, in achieving your market share gains?
Douglas Lawson: Yes. Dave, we are. This quarter we landed Purion in 7 new fabs, 3 of those brand-new customers. It's a mix of Purion XEs and Purion Hs. It's a mix of memory and mature technologies. We absolutely are meeting the objectives of getting those tools out there and into new customers. The Purion XE, in the high-energy market has been very strong, driven a lot by the image sensor requirements, and by the custom logic demands with the foundries and some of the IDMs have. So that is, that has been a strong performer for us.
David Duley: Okay. And as far as the memory business goes, I think you talked about how there was a lot of 18 nanometer conversion activity from, I think, one customer or reference one customer in the DRAM space. Do you expect that strength, how long would, I think you started off the year saying that the strength would be six months in duration? Do you think that's going to last longer now as many of your, or maybe just give us a view on how you think the sustainability of the DRAM segment of the business is?
Douglas Lawson: Yes. So Dave, we definitely see strength. Pricing has held up. And as long as pricing holds up, then there will be continued investment. One of the things that we've noted is that DRAM spending is being metered. That's probably the best way to look at it. The same three guys that are doing DRAM are trying to spend as much as they can in NAND because there's such a growing market there. So that in itself is helping control the spend, but there is spend there. And as Mary said, half our, about half of our revenue this quarter was from DRAM, or of our memory revenue was from DRAM. And we see it being, continuing to be strong as long as pricing holds up, which based on everything the memory suppliers have said, and their customers have said, looks like it goes through, at least, the third quarter, maybe a little longer.
David Duley: Okay. So that's helpful. The DRAM spending looks like it might pass or be strong into the, beyond the second quarter, into the third quarter. And just a final thing on that topic. Do you, in your thinking about the DRAM business, have you started to include new factories in your thinking yet? Or is that an '18 event?
Mary Puma: No. It's definitely -- I would call it late 2017, early 2018 event. So some of it could start this year.
David Duley: Okay. And final thing from me, for Kevin. Just looking at the press release, I noticed that you when you gave the service revenue and gross, and cost of goods sold, the service margins were negative. So could you talk -- and yet you achieved spectacular margins on your products and still hit your 40% target. So maybe just help me understand why the service gross margin was negative during the quarter?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So I'll start off by saying our service business, as a whole, if it includes spare parts upgrades, used tools and stuff. It's very accretive overall for the business, and we always say that. Unfortunately, the accounting side of things. When you see service in the breakout in the press release, Dave, that's just the labor piece. It typically does not -- it's not typically a negative event, but it's not a high margin part of the business. And in the particular quarter, in Q1, it really had to do with some new contracts we put in place that were just a little bit more heavily loaded with cost up front, which you kind of take the revenue spread over the term of the contract. But it's a very small revenue number that's associated with that negative margin there.
David Duley: Okay. Thank you so much. Congratulations on nice results guys.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mark Miller from Benchmark.
Mark Miller: You talked a little about, in the prior question, how sales and backlog broke out in the first quarter between NAND and DRAM. From what I've heard today, it sounds like things will remain strong, but it sounds like the breakout in terms of orders later in the year will shift more towards NAND. Is that a false assumption?
Douglas Lawson: We haven't really been specific on that. But right now, from a general market perspective, we see the NAND market strong for at least the next year to 2 years. There will be periods where it's real strong and periods where there might be gaps between projects. The DRAM market is going to cycle based on pricing. And the investment that goes when pricing is -- it goes up when pricing is high. So if DRAM pricing stays high through the end of the year, then DRAM would probably contribute more. If DRAM pricing falls in the later part of the year, then NAND would probably contribute more. But it's really too hard to come up with an exact number on that yet, Mark.
Mark Miller: Okay. Can you break out by your 3 principal tools first quarter sales and backlog? What percentage for each of the 3 major tools?
Mary Puma: No. We don't provide that, Mark.
Mark Miller: Okay. Was -- the mix was stronger this quarter than expected for next quarter?
Mary Puma: The mix --.
Douglas Lawson: We had a -- we did say, in Q1, Mark, we had a strong mix of Purion XE.
Mary Puma: Yes. A lot of high energy.
Douglas Lawson: But we did have, in Q1, we had a strong mix of high energy.
Mark Miller: Okay. Alright, thank you/
Douglas Lawson: Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we have a follow up question from Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Your line is open
Craig Ellis: Thanks for taking the follow up. I wanted to start, just going back to your comments on geographic dynamics, Mary. That was very helpful. Our research -- and I think it's fairly well known that there's 19 fabs or so that are under consideration, many of them under construction, many in advanced stages. A vast majority of those are mature foundry fabs, some are memory. I think you mentioned that you saw some potential for memory in China next year. What would be helpful is if you could provide some color on how you think Axcelis will fare from a share standpoint in the mature foundry area? And then, secondly, when you look to memory next year, in China, do you see potential for DRAM and NAND? Or is it one or the other? And to what extent is it pilot lines versus production et cetera? Of course, not asking for any customer-specifics, just for what you see in the market right now.
Mary Puma: Okay. So a lot of what we are seeing in China right now has to do with mature process technology versus memory. And we have a very strong position in those fabs. Most of those fabs are owned by customers who we've done business with in the past. That said, we actually are penetrating with Purion products. They had bought our legacy tools in the past. And we expect that business to remain strong through at least this year and into next year. Starting in 2018 as you referenced, Craig, there are a number of projects that are on the drawing boards right now. Some, they've actually broken ground and are, have, there's construction and there are buildings. We expect that to start to ramp up in 2018. We think it will be a mix of DRAM and NAND. Always a question about where is the technology going to come from, but I think a number of those players are actually working through that. And we should hear, there should be some announcements at some point over the second half of the year that will clarify some of that. We do very well in the memory market. Many of those customers use some of our existing memory customers as reference sights. It's very well known where Axcelis has it's strength and which product. And so as that market picks up, we fully expect to get our fair share of that business in China in memory and really add that to what we're already doing on the mature process technology side of the business.
Craig Ellis: Excellent color. The next two are really related to the target model. They may be for Doug or Kevin. First, at the high end, the progression from $450 million to $460 million in revenue, up to $550 million. What accounts for that new higher range of revenue? Is it the view that there's greater share to be had out there for Axcelis? Or that the market is bigger? Or is there assumption that there may be new product areas that the company could pursue?
Kevin Brewer: It's primarily share. So last year, we gained 14 new customers for Purion. In the first quarter alone we gained seven new ones. So we feel we've got good opportunity to continue to gain the share. And so the four, what was the old model at $460 million, which really assumed around a 35% market share. We think we can get higher than that. And hence, we're showing the model that shows what it would look like when we get there.
Craig Ellis: Excellent. And then, the second question, and this one's a bit trickier because the model parameter's down and the middle of the income statement go from dollars to percentages. But it looks like the old OpEx assumption was around 20%. The new one looks like it's closer to mid-20s. Does that reflect some of the investments that the company was talking about on this call? Or what accounts for the change in the operating expense assumption model-to-model?
Kevin Brewer: It is the investments we are talking about, Craig. We're adding some infrastructure to support China. We're adding additional R&D funding on these product extensions develop some new offerings. And there's some other things with the variable comp side that's changed. But it really is all the things we highlighted before driving this a little bit higher. And when you get out to the $550 million model, I think, if you look at the range, it's actually a very reasonable range to be in. And right now, I guess, the other thing I'd add to there are -- there's a lot of evals going on right now. We're kind of treading along new customers, but with that comes a cost. So the good news is we're fanning out, but there is a lot of evals out there, and there is several more planned for this year. And those are going to spill into '18 for sure. So it's probably one area where we might have been a little bit more optimistic when we've put out that model together a few years ago about how much eval expense we would have at this point in the revenue curve. But the reality of it is, we've got to do this to grow the business.
Craig Ellis: That's a nice problem to have.
Kevin Brewer: Yes.
Douglas Lawson: The other thing, Craig -- Craig, I just want to add, sort of a conclusion on that is, is we're in this unprecedented market where there is just great opportunity across all the segments, across all the geographies, and if there is a time to invest and to spend to make sure we can grow our market share, now is the time to do it. And that's one of the other reasons why we're able to add that other column on to the target business model.
Craig Ellis: The last question on that topic then, from where we are today, which is 27.5% of sales of the model that you have longer term would be 200 basis points below that. Does the business need to invest significantly so that OpEx as a percent of sales would rise materially before we get to a lower level down the road? Or do you think you can manage growth in your operating expense profile so that we're moving more steadily on a downward trajectory towards that longer-term target that you have?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. Well, I may certainly think this year the Q2 number, $26 million, is a peak and full year will be probably closer to an average of $25 million a quarter. So it's moving to the $450 million range. I think a lot of things are in place, and a lot of things working on right now are pretty much there. So some of that becomes more of the variable piece of the equation, rather than heavy investment in any particular thing.
Craig Ellis: Thanks Kevin.
Kevin Brewer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Well, we're pleased with our first quarter performance and excited about the prospects of a strong year for Axcelis and the industry. As always, I want to thank you for your continued support and hope to see you in the coming months. We will be attending several conferences, including the 18th Annual B. Riley Institutional Investor Conference in Santa Monica, California on May 24; the 14th Annual Craig-Hallum Institutional Investor Conference on May 31 in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and the 2017 Stifel Technology Internet and Media Conference on June 6 in San Francisco, California. Thank you, again.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[-0.05855860809605884, 0.034046166724629456];0.034046166724629456;-0.05855860809605884;0
17;ACLS;2017-08-05;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company's results for the Second Quarter of 2017. My name is Michelle, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We'll be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Michelle. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued earlier today, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's safe harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today, Axcelis reported strong second quarter 2017 financial results. Revenues for the quarter were $102.8 million with gross margins at 38%, operating profit of $12.5 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.33, as explained in our press release. Our systems mix in the quarter was 37% mature foundry/logic and 63% memory. Although both market segments are robust, we saw a strong burst of memory investment during the quarter which we expect is sustainable through Q3 and the remainder of this year. This has shifted the geographic mix of our systems shipments towards Korea, which accounted for 60% of our shipments. China was 19%; the U.S. and Europe, 7%; and the rest of the world, 14%. Chinese market activity is driven by mature process technology supporting IoT devices. We expect investments in China to strengthen further when spending to add memory capacity begins in 2018 and 2019. Purion products continued to gain momentum. In Q2, Purion accounted for 87% of our systems revenue. We placed a Purion system in one new DRAM fab during the quarter. We also successfully closed and took revenue on a Purion H evaluation system and received follow-on orders from this customer for a nonvolatile memory application. We expect that additional Purion evaluations will successfully close in the third quarter. Our business outlook remains positive. In the third quarter, we are forecasting revenues of approximately $95 million; gross margins of approximately 38%; operating profit of $10 million to $12 million; and EPS of $0.27 to $0.31 excluding any impact of ASU 2016-09. We expect to end the quarter with approximately $120 million of total cash. In the third quarter, we also anticipate a systems mix of approximately 40% mature foundry and logic, and 60% memory. Since SEMICON West, our visibility into the second half of the year has improved, resulting in a further tightening of our 2017 revenue estimate towards the high end of our range. We now expect 2017 revenues of approximately $380 million, representing an implant market share of between 26% and 28% based on a slightly higher implant TAM of $1 billion. This implies a forecast of revenues in the fourth quarter that will be equivalent to or better than revenues in Q3. For the full year, we believe the systems segment split will be weighted toward the memory market. As we have discussed throughout the year, we will continue to invest aggressively to grow revenues and capitalize on strong market conditions. This will include incremental investment in R&D to develop additional Purion product extensions targeted at specific customer requirements. We will also selectively invest in SG&A to address our increasing customer base, especially in China, and to expand our reach into leading-edge logic customers in the Japanese market. Demo activity at our Advanced Technology Center in Beverly, Massachusetts continues strong. The Advanced Technology Center is a key asset for Axcelis. It is a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to implant, allowing customers and our engineers to work on the most advanced implant processes. In fact, we've recently installed a KLA-Tencor Surfscan SP5, one of the most advanced particle detection tools available. It will allow our engineers, working closely with our customers, to drive further improvements in our Purion products and lead to the placement of additional customer evaluations and penetrations. This activity is key to achieving our long-term target business model. Three key assumptions in our model are: a strong foundation built on two areas; continued strength in the mature process technology segment and our services business; a robust memory cycle, driven by sustained NAND activity, cyclical strength in the DRAM market and growth in nonvolatile memory; wins from new regions and market segments, including the Chinese memory market, penetrations into leading-edge logic and reentry into Japan. Before Kevin reviews the details of our second quarter financials, I would like to reiterate our four key objectives for 2017. First, we will focus on new customer penetrations with Purion. The expanding number of customers investing in IoT, 3D NAND and China has broadened the CapEx opportunity, providing new prospects for Axcelis. And in fact, Axcelis has penetrated 22 new customer fabs with Purion products since the first quarter of last year. Second, we will also drive to grow our share of business at existing customers, as they increase their capacity in 2017. We have been successful in gaining additional customer recipes on existing tools as well as getting customers to bring in multiple types of Purion implant systems. Third, we will focus our marketing and engineering resources on enhancing Purion and on developing additional product extensions to drive revenue. Offering higher energy ranges on our Purion XE and the ability to implant silicon carbide on our Purion M are excellent examples of successfully implementing this strategy. And fourth, we will execute against detailed gross margin improvement program. Our systems gross margins have shown significant improvement since we began shipping the full Purion product line in 2015. Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. In Q2, we delivered solid financial results with quarterly revenues, operating profit and total cash finishing at the highest levels in 10 years. Gross margins were in line with expectations, driven by product and segment mix and a closure of another Purion H evaluation system, which has already generated follow-on orders. This year's strong diversified market is providing Axcelis with an opportunity to firmly establish Purion across a broader customer base. We have captured new fab penetrations, and have planned to ship and close on additional Purion evaluation tools during the remainder of 2017. As previously mentioned, we're also investing updating core business systems and adding headcount and infrastructure to support new fab penetrations. Variable compensation has also been adjusted to support our higher full year revenue forecast. At this point, I believe, current spending levels are adequately aligned to support strategic initiatives and planned revenue growth. Quarterly gross margins will continue to be influenced by product and segment mix. For 2017, revenue are now forecasted around $380 million as segment mix is much more heavily weighted toward systems, which carries lower gross margins than our CS&I business. Based on this change of segment mix, we expect to exit the year with gross margins in the 38% to 39% range. Full year average gross margins will be in a similar range in our highest level in 11 years, driven by Purion platform commonality and good progress on labor and material cost-out programs. Now I'll review the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue finished above guidance at $102.8 million compared to $86.9 million in Q1. Q2 system sales were $62.4 million compared to $55.3 million in Q1. Q2 CS&I revenue finished at $44.4 million compared to $31.6 million in Q1. This higher-than-typical CS&I revenue was driven by a one time customer upgrade project. Q2 sales of our top-10 customers accounted for about 86% of our total sales compared to 85% in Q1, with four of these customers at 10% or above. Q2 system bookings were $45.3 million compared to $97.2 million in Q1. Our Q2 book-to-bill ratio was 0.7 versus 1.71 in Q1. Backlog in Q2 finished at $29.1 million compared to $48.2 million in Q1. The gap between bookings and backlog reflects the fact that we often book and ship tools in the same quarter, especially when we see strong activity in the Korean market. Q2 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $26.5 million and in line with guidance compared to $24 million in Q1. SG&A in the quarter was $15.2 million with R&D at $11.3 million. In the third quarter, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately $26 million, which includes previously discussed investments and variable compensation expenses. Gross margin in Q2 finished at 38% compared to 40% in Q1. In Q3, we expect gross margins to again be approximately 38% based on product and segment mix and planned Purion evaluation tool closures. Operating profit in Q2 was $12.5 million compared to $10.7 million in Q1. Net income in Q2 was $13.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to net income in Q1 of $9.5 million or $0.29 per diluted share. In 2017, the company adopted Accounting Standard Update 2016-09, which addresses accounting for equity compensation expense and related tax effects. In the second quarter, this new standard had a $2.8 million positive impact on our net income and a $0.09 positive impact in earnings per share. This accounting change has no impact on the company's operating profit or cash flow. Excluding the effect of ASU 2016-09, net income for the quarter would have been $11.1 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Q2 inventory ended at $122.6 million compared to $115.6 million in Q1. Inventory turns, excluding evaluations, finished at 2.3 compared to 2.1 in Q1. Q2 accounts payable were $27.6 million compared to $26.4 million in Q1. Q2 receivables were $48.6 million compared to $67.1 million in Q1. Q2 total cash finished at $115.4 million compared to $76.2 million in Q1. In the quarter, we generated $34.1 million of cash from operations and an additional $6.8 million of cash from stock option exercises. We expect Q3 total cash to finish at approximate $120 million. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in Q2. Solid execution across the business and a strong balance sheet position us well to broaden our Purion footprint and achieve projected market share gains. I will now turn the call back to Mary for her closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. The industry continues to enjoy a period of unusually strong growth, driven by the robust IoT and data storage markets. In order to capitalize on these favorable market conditions, our focus is on driving revenue growth and profitability. We are executing on this in two ways: First, by building a broader customer base in both the memory and mature process technology segment, penetrating the leading-edge logic segment and re-entering the Japanese market; and second, by improving our gross margins and controlling and aligning our costs with our revenue growth objectives. Axcelis is providing customers with a strong alternative in ion implantation. Numerous discussions with customers reveal the reasons they are choosing Axcelis and Purion. Advanced Technology is the first factor. The Purion product family provides them significant advantages in performance as measured by the angle dose and energy control derived from our scanned spot beam technology. The common Purion M station and ELS4 Source provide them with higher productivity and up-time, offering cost of ownership advantages. Second, our strength in listening to our customers and providing them with implant solutions tailored for their needs differentiates us from the competition. The fact that we can offer our Purion technology at 150, 200 and 300 millimeter is a good example of the technology advantages and flexibility that we offer. Finally, there is the innovation benefit, which by promoting competition, allows customers to gain significant technology advances and engineering expertise, resulting in improvement in productivity, yield and cost of ownership. Customers can maximize these advantages by splitting their business evenly between two strong implant suppliers. Every customer that has brought in the Purion H for high current, an area where there has been little competition in the recent past, has realized significant benefit. This has generated strong customer pull for the Purion H and will allow Axcelis to continue to grow its footprint and market share. We are closing in on the financial and market share goals we laid out several years ago and have been steadily working toward. With robust end markets and strong execution, our path to achieving our target business model is clear and within reach. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Peter Peng: This is Peter Peng calling in for Craig Ellis. The first question I have is just on the ion implant TAM for 2018. Just given the China fab build-out, the 3D NAND build-out and a sustained DRAM, why wouldn't that argue for a year-on-year growth?
Douglas Lawson: For 2018, Peter?
Peter Peng: Yes, that's right.
Douglas Lawson: Right now, we're forecasting 2018 around $1 billion, relatively flat. It's still early to tell exactly how big the Chinese build will be and what that will exactly mean. But that's in line with where the industry analysts have it at this point.
Peter Peng: Okay. And the -- and then the other question is just on market share. Just based on your 5-year trends, seems like you're making really good progress with 500 basis points per year. And just given the number of placements for this year, is there any way that this is going to go above for 2018? Or is this -- are you expecting this kind of trajectory?
Mary Puma: Well, we expect -- I'm not exactly sure what you're asking. But I mean we are expecting significant market share gains this year. We've narrowed the range now to 26% to 28%, and we're growing significantly faster than the TAM for ion implantation, which we just discussed. It was about $850 million last year and up to approximately $1 billion this year. We put our target business models out there for revenues at $450 million and $550 million, which represents market share in the 32% to 40% range. And again those are the targets that we are working toward over the next several years. So yes we expect to continue on an upward trajectory into 2018 and even beyond that.
Peter Peng: Okay. And just comparing the TAM from your last market deck to this market deck, it seems like there's some changes in terms of the slope. If I recall correctly, the last investor deck, it has a 2019 growing. So what's been the change?
Douglas Lawson: The other years, from 2019 -2020, and 2021, are data from Gartner. So they revise their forecast about every -- essentially every quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company.
Arthur Su: This is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Thanks for letting us to asking questions. The first one is just on the completion of the ongoing Purion H eval that you mentioned in the press release prior to SEMICON. I think you talked about initial follow-on orders. When do -- in what quarter do you expect those follow-on orders to be recognized?
Mary Puma: We expect shipment in 2017.
Arthur Su: Okay. Got it. And then Mary, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about some long-term business drivers, the longer-term ones, including Chinese memory, penetration into leading-edge logic and reentry into Japan. Can you just provide a quick update on kind of those areas? I know the Chinese memory's obviously dependent upon the market. But just an update on the efforts there. And which ones do you think will have more material impact in the near term?
Mary Puma: So from a Chinese memory market standpoint, we've talked about, and I think it's pretty consistent with what we've heard from others, that it's more of a 2018, 2019 build-out. It's -- there are several projects right now, I'd say anywhere from 2 to 4 fabs out of the many, many fabs that have been discussed, that potentially could happen that we expect would actually start in 2018. We are working with all of those customers, and in fact, we are planning for increased investment for infrastructure: to put offices in, make sure that we have appropriate field service support; we've got the right inventory. So all of that is essentially underway right now from a planning standpoint to get ready for that. From a Japanese market perspective, we've actually had some good engagement with some of the Japanese customers. We've had them in here. We've done demos, and that is moving along at the pace that I think we expected. Having said that, we've also talked about that it takes a while to get into the Japanese market if you're a non-Japanese equipment supplier. So that is something also that we expect will likely be a 2018, 2019 time frame activity, before we really are shipping units and seeing any revenue from it. And the last thing is leading-edge foundry/logic, and we are still working hard to place at least one Purion H evaluation unit at one of the large leading-edge foundry/logic customers. And that's something that, as the year -- as we continue through the year when that happens, it would be something that we would likely put out a press release on. So you'll just have to watch for that. But again, not something that we're going to see any revenue from immediately, again, another 2018, 2019 kind of revenue activity.
Arthur Su: Got it. Thank you so much for that color. If I can ask just on the 3Q systems mix. I know 60% -- you said 60% was coming from memory. Is there a way we can think about the split of that between NAND and DRAM?
Mary Puma: Yes, if you look at it, it's almost a 50-50 split between DRAM and NAND, but slightly more heavily weighted towards NAND. That's in terms of the shipments that we had during the quarter.
Arthur Su: Got it. And just one last question. The cash balance has increased substantially this quarter and surpassed that $100 million mark that you have outlined in 2Q. As the cash balance continues to grow, what do you have planned in terms of your capital deployment strategy?
Kevin Brewer: Well, at this point, we're just reinvesting in the business. We've some pretty robust growth plans in place. We've got our $450 million to $550 million target models out there. And that's where we're going to place some money at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel.
Brian Chin: Hi, there. This is actually Brian Chin on for Patrick. Sorry another baton switches here in terms of analysts. Thanks for let me ask a couple of questions here though. Congratulations on the Purion win in the quarter. And revenue is clearly coming in higher for the year than expected. I do want to probe the gross margins a little bit, and there are a couple of factors causing the range to be maybe about 100 basis points lower than expected. Can you just kind of break down how much of this is attributed to the higher systems mix, how much to the higher memory customer mix, and maybe to the evaluation unit as well?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So the majority of what we're seeing right now is we exit the year is coming from systems. Our original plans and if you remember original targets on, we had a much larger range of $320 million to $380 million. We were assuming a higher mix of CSI versus systems. But this growth is coming out of systems, which is putting us at the high end now. And we always talk about CSI having accretive gross margins. The systems margins aren't as high as CS&I, but they're improving. And the chart in our investor pitch shows the progress we've made since we implemented and actually introduced the full Purion product line. So we're not -- it's not like we're losing ground. We're continuing to lower the cost of these tools quarter-over-quarter. We're making really good improvements on gross margin, but we're just getting a big swing of systems versus CSI on year-end exit. I think kind of the important thing is, though, if you look at our full year gross margins, we're right on plan on where we think the full year average gross margins are going to land in that 30% to 39% range. And we're clicking along right now at some of highest levels. We've got our target models out there, which still are valid in terms of what we're saying, so 40% to 42%, $450 million; 42% to 44% to $550 million. And as we continue to raise revenue, get higher revenues, systems, well, the good thing is the volume will start kicking in more, too. So it's not like added systems is always a bad thing. It does help the volume, and as we move farther into some of our projects, where we have engineering cost on things and get the volume, these system gross margins will certainly more closely align with the service side of the business. But -- so I think the short answer is, the majority of the back end is really the mix between CS&I and systems at this point.
Brian Chin: Okay. Great. Thanks Kevin. And also Mary and Doug, in terms of the DRAM business that you're seeing, there's some nonvolatile memory, there's some DRAM. But the DRAM side is in more -- are you seeing mainly migration -- node migration, lithography shrink-related shrink activity? Or are you starting to see some capacity as well? And is that maybe factored into your second half estimates at all?
Douglas Lawson: Well, it's a combination, Brian. The shrinks tend to lead to additional requirements for implant. So you get the shrink implants added. And as a result, that actually reduces the overall capacity in the fabs. And then the customers usually fill in and add additional capacity. So it's a combination. But it is largely driven by the shrinks.
Brian Chin: Okay. And is it fair to say -- referencing the comments at -- in the past couple of weeks since SEMICON, your visibility has improved. Is that largely maybe in the DRAM space specifically? Or is there a better way to characterize that?
Mary Puma: No, I think it's really across the board. It's in both of the major segment, memory segment across types, so all three types and then also the mature process technology.
Douglas Lawson: I think Brian the other thing to keep in mind is for Axcelis, a lot of our growth is coming from new customers. And so it's -- in this particular case, we're seeing growth in memory, both DRAM, traditional NAND and other nonvolatile areas; and then significant growth in image sensors, power devices and other mature technologies, I mean, both IDM and foundries.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Duley of Steelhead. Your line is open.
David Duley: Thanks for taking my question. As far as your market share gains in 2017 are quite substantial versus the 2016 number. Which product segment do you think contributed the most to those share gains, the Purion H, M or the XE?
Mary Puma: We've had very strong demand for the Purion XE, and not just the basic Purion XE, but also the additional product extensions that we've had, the EXE and VXE. So the high-energy market has been very good. But we've also seen a lot of additional penetration with the Purion H, and that's very good news for us. Because as we know, that's 60% of the implant market, and that's the area where, with those penetrations, we're actually going to see the most growth.
David Duley: Okay. And asking the same question a slightly different way. When you look at the end markets, the IoT or NAND, or DRAM segments, same question, where do you think you picked up the most market share during calendar 2017?
Mary Puma: I think it's actually been across the board. We picked up probably more new customers because they are more customers in the mature process technology area. But in memory, we actually made significant progress at a third memory chip maker and had -- have already seen some follow-on business from that. And that's something that will open up significant -- a significant opportunity for us as that customer continues to buy, moving into 2018 and beyond. So I think maybe more customers on the mature process technology side, but with the memory, we continued to hold strong at the two customers, where we already had a foothold, and are really looking forward to the opportunity to work with that third customer. And by the way, we actually had a fourth memory chip device maker as well in 2017. So we've got pretty good penetration across the majority of those major device makers.
Douglas Lawson: Yes and David the other thing I think relative to the question on the product split there. In the IoT or mature markets, we've seen a lot of activity with Purion M in the power device market. We've seen a significant amount of opportunity and activity with Purion XE, EXE and VXE in image sensors. And then in the general foundry market for mature logic, we've seen a lot of activity with new customers relative to Purion H.
David Duley: Okay. Excellent. Kevin, maybe help me understand with -- at least from what you can see now, how many evaluate systems kind of lower -- and I would call those lower margin evals, do you expect to place in the third or fourth quarter or recognize revenue on?
Kevin Brewer: Well, we still have four outstanding evals right now and the plans right now would be to close some of those evals out this year. We also have plans, David, for additional evals. So right now I'm thinking we're going to continue to have 3 to 4 evals out there. We've been closing them typically in the 6 to 12 month period, with the exception of one that just closed, which everybody knows, was a very long one. So we're going to -- I think in terms of modeling, we're going to continue to see the impact of evals in each quarter, certainly into next year. But all the targets that we put together, we've kind of assumed what we thought would be net for evals. So it's covered in terms that lead to our planning.
David Duley: So I guess just thinking about that, if you continue to place them and the number stays constant, then you're probably going to close one per quarter is the goal.
Mary Puma: It probably be a couple more this year. But we're not going to forecast the quarter.
Kevin Brewer: I mean, it could add up maybe 2 go in a quarter. But they're going to be -- they're not all going out at the same time. So they -- in theory, they should be closing staggered. Yes, if you're trying to model, that's probably the best thing to do.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: We're pleased with our second quarter performance and the prospect for a strong year for both Axcelis and the industry. As always, I want to thank you for your continued support, and hope to see you in the coming months. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[-0.027355668210865325, 0.013747487537299596];0.013747487537299596;-0.027355668210865325;0
18;ACLS;2017-11-04;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company’s Results for the Third Quarter of 2017. My name is Brian, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma’am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Brian. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued earlier today, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC’s safe harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Today, Axcelis reported strong third quarter 2017 financial results. Revenues for the quarter were $104.5 million, with gross margins at 38%, operating profit at $13.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38, as explained in our press release. Our systems mix in the quarter was 64% mature process technology and 36% memory. Although both market segments remain robust, we saw significant activity in the image sensor market during the quarter especially in Korea. This image sensor activity, combined with continued strength in memory, provided a geographic mix of our systems shipments weighted towards Korea, which accounted for 61% of our shipments. China was 24%; the U.S. and Europe, 5%; and Taiwan, the remaining 10%. Our business outlook remains positive. In the fourth quarter, we are forecasting revenues of approximately $107 million to $112 million; gross margins of 37% to 38%; operating profit of $14 million to $15.5 million; and non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 to $0.41, excluding any impact of ASU 2016-09. We expect to end the quarter with approximately $130 million of total cash. In the fourth quarter, we also anticipate a systems mix of approximately 70% mature foundry/logic and 30% memory. We now expect 2017 revenues to exceed $400 million, narrowing our implant market share to between 27% and 28% based on an implant TAM of $1 billion. Systems revenue for the year will be weighted in favor of the mature process technology segment. All Purion products continued to gain momentum. In Q3, Purion accounted for 94.4% of our systems revenue. The high energy market was strong in both memory and mature process technologies, while the Purion H footprint continued to grow. We closed two evaluations during the quarter and received follow-on orders from both customers. The first was a Purion VXE used for advanced image sensor devices. The second was a Purion H qualified by a DRAM manufacturer. With this new customer, Purion H is now in production at eight customers in 11 different fabs. We expect additional new Purion H penetrations in the fourth quarter. Overall market conditions remain very strong. Market indicators also suggest this strength will continue into 2018. The drivers of this cycle have not changed. The Internet of Things continues to grow. Automotive and industrial applications have been the strongest segments. Image sensors, custom logic devices and silicon carbide power devices have been especially strong for Axcelis in the mature process technology segment. All of these connected devices are generating massive data flows requiring storage and analytics. This is driving both 3D NAND and DRAM demand. This demand continues to outstrip supply, thus keeping CapEx levels healthy. Memory customers are investing heavily in 3D NAND and metering their spending in DRAM strength and additional wafer starts. This behavior is expected to continue into 2018, and is good for the industry and good for Axcelis. Additionally, many memory customers are already talking about significant capacity investments in 2019. Purion’s continued success and these market trends support Axcelis’ target business model as outlined in our investor presentation. We have a plan to achieve our target business model over the next two years to three years. This plan includes achieving the following: continuing to grow our recipe count and footprint at existing customers, including increasing our share in new memory customers in both DRAM, 3D NAND and nonvolatile memory; successfully placing multiple Purion products in new Chinese memory projects; reentering the Japanese market; and penetrating leading-edge foundry/logic. Before Kevin reviews the details of our third quarter financials, I would like to once again reiterate our four key objectives for 2017, which have been critical to our success this year. First, we are focusing on new customer penetrations with Purion. The expanding number of customers investing in IoT, 3D NAND and China has broadened the CapEx opportunity, providing new prospects for Axcelis. During Q3, we added six new Purion fabs, three of these were new customers. Axcelis has now penetrated 28 new customer fabs with Purion products since the first quarter of 2016. Second, we are also driving to grow our share of business at existing customers as they increase their capacity in 2017. We’ve been successful in expanding the number of recipes on existing tools as well as selling additional Purion products to existing customers. We now have 12 customers with multiple types of Purion systems. Third, we are focusing our marketing and engineering resources on enhancing Purion and on developing additional product extensions. This quarter, we recognized significant revenue from the Purion VXE in the image sensor market. And fourth, we are executing against detailed gross margin improvement programs. Our systems margins have improved 15.1 percentage points since Q1 2015 on a rolling 4-quarter average. Now I’d like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results with revenue, operating profit and total cash finishing above 10-year highs set in Q2. We also finished ahead of consensus estimates and have guided Q4 above current expectations. The continued strength in the overall semiconductor market is providing Axcelis an opportunity to firmly establish Purion across a broader customer base. We captured six new fab penetrations during the quarter and have plans to ship and close additional Purion evaluation tools during the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margins were in line with our guidance, driven by revenue mix and a closure of two additional evaluation systems: a Purion H for DRAM and a Purion VXE for image sensors. Quarterly gross margins will continue to be influenced by the number of eval tools closed out, the mix of systems revenue versus CS&I revenue and the mix within our system shipments. Margin improvement remains a top priority in the business, and we are continuing to make solid progress on supply chain, engineering, manufacturing cost-out initiatives. Since the full launch of the Purion product line in Q1 of 2015, we have increased systems standard margins 1,510 basis points on a rolling 4-quarter average. I will now review the third quarter financial results. Q3 revenue finished above guidance at $104.5 million compared to $102.8 million in Q2. Q3 system sales were $69.2 million compared to $62.4 million in Q2. Q3 CS&I revenue finished at $35.3 million compared to $40.4 million in Q2. Q3 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for about 80% of our total sales compared to 86% in Q2, with two of these customers at 10% or above. Q3 system bookings were $83.2 million compared to $45.3 million in Q2. Our Q3 book-to-bill ratio is 1.18 versus 0.7 in Q2. Backlog in Q3 finished at $42.1 million compared to $29.1 million in Q2. Q3 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $25.9 million and in line with guidance, compared to $26.5 million in Q2. SG&A in the quarter was $14.9 million, with R&D at $11 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately $26.5 million as we continue to invest in updating core business systems and adding infrastructure to support both existing customers and new fab penetrations. Variable compensation has also been adjusted to support our higher full year revenue forecast. Q3 gross margin finished at 38%, flat to Q2. In Q4, we are projecting gross margins to be approximately 37% and 38%, impacted by the number of Purion H shipments, which are forecasted to be 50% higher than in any other quarter this year. We have a number of planned margin improvement initiatives that are expected to increase Purion H margins to more closely align with the Purion XE over time. Operating profit in Q3 was $13.8 million compared to $12.5 million in Q2. Net income in Q3 was $11.8 million or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to net income in Q2 of $13.9 million or $0.42 per diluted share. These results reflect the impact of ASU 2016-09, which requires us to report tax credits or tax expense depending on the options exercised in the quarter. In the second quarter, this standard increased our GAAP net income and EPS. But in the third quarter, it lowered our net income by $0.8 million, reducing our earnings per diluted share by $0.03. Excluding the effect of this standard, net income for the third quarter would have been $12.7 million or $0.38 per share, in comparison to 11.3 – $11.1 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the second quarter. Q3 inventory ended at $123.4 million compared to $122.6 million in Q2. Inventory turns, excluding evaluations, finished at 2.2 compared to 2.3 in Q2. Accounts payable were $33.6 million in Q3 compared to $27.6 million in Q2 due to the timing of receipts. Q3 receivables were $69.8 million compared to $48.6 million in Q2 due to the timing of shipments. Q3 total cash finished at $120.7 million compared to $115.4 million in Q2. In the quarter, we generated $8.9 million of cash from operations and an additional $1.8 million of cash from option exercises. We expect Q4 total cash to finish at approximately $130 million. I am very pleased with our financial performance in Q3. Solid execution across the business and a strong balance sheet are allowing us to invest in the business, resulting in top and bottom line growth. Our Purion footprint continues to expand, as evidenced by the number of new fab and customer penetrations, and is key to us achieving our higher revenue targets. I will now turn the call back to Mary for her closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. This is a good time to be in the semiconductor industry. It is rare to have a prolonged cycle with steady growth like this. The last comparable period was in the late 90s. There are major similarities between these two time periods. In the late 90s, millions of people were adding connectivity with the advent of the web browser and the introduction of the search engine. This drove a surge in PC upgrades as well as storage and communication requirements. Now we are witnessing billions, if not trillions, of devices being connected. Data is being accumulated in proportions never before seen, along with the development of advanced analytics and AI. We believe that we continue to be in a sustained growth cycle that is now expected to extend into next year and potentially beyond. In order to capitalize on these favorable market conditions, our focus is on driving revenue growth, profitability and market share gains. The Purion product family is highly competitive and provides Axcelis the opportunity to offer customers a strong alternative in ion implantation that will result in market share leadership. We are now closing in on the financial and market share goals we laid out several years ago and have been steadily executing against. With robust end markets and strong execution, our path to achieving our target business model is clear and within reach. Before closing, I would like to take the opportunity to thank our employees who tirelessly work to satisfy our customers and continually improve our products. This great year would not be possible without their hard work and dedication. With that, I’d like to open it up for questions. Brian?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Sir, your line is now open.
Peter Peng: Hi, this is actually Peter Peng calling in for Craig Ellis. First off, just I may have missed this, but what is the system mix breakdown for Q3?
Mary Puma: The shipments in terms of the regions or customers...
Peter Peng: Just between memory and mature foundry.
Mary Puma: Memory was 36% and mature process technologies was 64%.
Peter Peng: Great. And then just looking at your market share, it seems like you’re tracking towards the 30% range for the year. Could you just kind of provide some color on where the share gain is coming from?
Mary Puma: So the share gain is actually coming from a number of places. If you take a look, we’ve had 14 new penetrations this – we’ve had 28 penetrations since the first quarter of 2016. It’s about an even split between new customers and existing customers and new fabs. This year alone, we’ve had 14 new Purion placements, and again, it’s about an even split between the new customers and the existing customers but putting a tool into a new fab. It’s a mix in terms of exactly where the penetrations have come. If you take a look at where we’ve penetrated, about 3/4 of those penetrations have come from mature process technology, the other 1/4 from memory. And I would say the majority this year of new penetrations have come from high energy, with the remainder coming from a split between high current and medium current.
Peter Peng: Great. And one last question before I hop back into the queue. Some of your peers are talking about industry growth of mid-single digit to high single digit for calendar 2018 and then with a profile that’s half-on-half growth. So first half growth over second half 2017. Is there any reason that Axcelis won’t be in line with that?
Mary Puma: No, there’s no reason we wouldn’t be in line with it. But again, remember, our story is very much predicated not only on strong markets, but it’s on gaining market share. So this year, we expect to be between 27% and 28%, up from about 17% last year. If you take a look at our target business models that are in our investor presentation, they represent 32% market share and then 40% market share. So 32% at the 450 model, 40% at the 550 model. And our goal is to continue to grow our revenues and gain market share and likely, when we get to the February quarter, we’ll – or in February when we report on the full year, we’ll also give some insight into what we believe will happen in 2018 from a market share perspective and the growth we expect to get.
Peter Peng: Great, thank you. And congratulation on the strong execution.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Sir, your line is now open.
Arthur Su: This is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Thanks for taking our questions and also congrats on the great quarter. Hey, so the first question is just on the guidance for the second half 2017. I just want to understand what drove the upside versus your prior guidance. And I know you don’t want to provide any quantitative targets for 2018, but how has that shaped your initial views for 2018 from a qualitative perspective?
Mary Puma: So I think it’s actually strengthened in both of the markets that we’ve talked about all year, the mature process technology area as well as memory, both 3D NAND and DRAM. And the real kicker has come from the share gains that we’re seeing. I mean, if you think back to what we’ve been talking about throughout the year, we talked about our market share. Well, I guess, at about midyear, we were at 26% to 28%. And now exiting the year, we’re taking a look at 27% to 28%, so we’ve been getting share gains actually in both of those segments.
Arthur Su: Got it, okay. And so, Mary, you talked about how systems mix in 2017 was mostly weighted for mature foundry/logic. How do you think that mix might shift as you go into 2018?
Mary Puma: I don’t think we expect to see any shift because most of – both of the markets are expected to remain strong. From interactions with our customers and projects that we’re seeing that they’re planning for at least the first half of 2018, we think that both of those segments will have strength. And we will continue to gain market share as well as part of that.
Doug Lawson: Arthur, the weighting – this particular quarter in Q3, it was more heavily weighted. But in general for the year, it’s going to be weighted towards mature, but it’s not too far off the center point likely, so – which is what we’ve been seeing over the last couple of years.
Arthur Su: Got it, okay. And Kevin, I guess my last question is just on gross margins. I know that – I think you just mentioned that on the call, that you expect fourth quarter gross margin of between 37% and 38%, and it’s partially impacted by strong Purion H shipments. Can you just kind of talk about some of the gross margin improvement initiatives you have on Purion H, and to what scale would we need to be, to be at a point where the Purion H is mature enough to have – to be corporate gross margin accretive?
Kevin Brewer: Yes, so what I’ll say in terms of gross margin overall, we’re continuing to make solid progress across three products: the XE, the M and the H. If you look at what’s really changed in the fourth quarter and what’s changed since this year started, system revenues are up significantly more than we had originally predicted when we were talking about higher year-end exits on gross margin. And systems mix is a much bigger portion now versus CS&I, which are very accretive. So that’s putting some of the pressure on the Q4 as well as we’ve got this big uptick in Purion H. Obviously, one thing that does help – I mean, volume is a good thing, and the volume is certainly helping. But probably the thing that’s not coming any faster from this uptick is we have several engineering cost-out projects underway and projects really on warranty and install improvements. And those are more time-based than they are volume-related. So while we are getting the benefit of additional volume, which is great, some of these other things just need to work their way through. So we’re kind of – the year is a little bit ahead of itself. The year-end mix is certainly different than where we thought we’d be when we started the year, and it’s much more heavily weighted towards systems than it is service. To your particular question on the H, it’s – there’s still a lot of work on supply chain. We’re getting the volume, but we’re still moving parts into our low-cost supply chain as the product becomes more mature. The H is our newest in terms if you look at the release of the Purion product. And in the investor pitch, we’ve had that slide in there. I think it’s around Slide 19 or somewhere in that vicinity that kind of showed that the H has been lagging the XE and the M a little bit. But that’s – we understand we need to stay focused there and get that more to parity with the VXE. So I think as these projects work their way through, that are more not volume-related but time-related, you’ll see that – those two margins come closer together, between the XE, which are much, at this point, higher than the H.
Arthur Su: Got it. Thanks so much and congrats on the great quarter again, guys.
Kevin Brewer: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab from Craig-Hallum Capital. Sir, your line is now open.
Christian Schwab: Hey, congratulations on another great quarter. What is your guys’ current outlook for China in 2018 and 2019?
Mary Puma: So we see a number of projects beginning to ramp up now for – to be prepared to take equipment in 2018. We are planning for that. We have added FSEs, field service people, opened some new offices. We’re making the investments that Kevin alluded to earlier in his script to be able to support that business. And furthermore, some customers are actually even starting to talk about projects in 2019. So we expect at least 2018 and into 2019 to be strong, and we expect to get our fair share of those projects.
Christian Schwab: And what is the mix of that, whether it’s memory or nonleading-edge or leading-edge? Can you give us an idea of what you’re working on?
Mary Puma: Yes, we’re working on projects in both of those areas. It’s a mix of memory and mature process.
DougLawson: Yes, right now, Christian, it’s more weighted towards mature process technologies. As we get into 2018, we’ll really start to see the memory stuff start to come on. And as far as 2019 goes, it’s too far out to really judge what the mix will be.
Christian Schwab: Okay. Can you give us the number of aggregate new fab projects in China that you’re – that you believe you have an opportunity to sell into, on an aggregate number?
Mary Puma: No. I mean, we’re working on all of them right now. So I’m not going to conjecture on exactly what the number will be.
Christian Schwab: Okay, perfect. All right. I’ve no questions. Thanks.
Doug Lawson: Thanks, Christian.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Sir, your line is now open.
Brian Chin: Hi, good afternoon. This is Brian Chin calling in for Patrick. Thanks for letting me after couple of questions. First congratulations on the results in the quarter. I am kind of curious though, it does appear that system mix in Q3 and second half is somewhat flipped relative to what was previously expected, with a much stronger tilt towards the mature products. Can you discuss what’s transpiring here? How much of this is the upside from things like image sensor or power versus any maybe delay or kick out in memory activity perhaps into next year?
Doug Lawson: No, Brian, actually, the mix is similar to what we were expecting. Memory continues to be very strong. There has been additional activity, more activity in the mature process technologies. There’s been a lot of activity in image sensor. We specifically highlighted increased activities, especially with the VXE, which is one of the product extensions on high energy in Korea where there’s some large image sensor manufacturers in Korea. Most of the time, people think of it just as a country that makes memory. And so there’s been a lot of activity there, and the Chinese market has also been – continued to be strong. We’ve said all along this year that it would be somewhere between 25% and 35 – 30% of our revenue, and it continues to be right in that range.
Brian Chin: Okay. And just to make sure I heard correctly, it sounds like the mix is, in Q3 and similar in Q4, is sort of 36% memory, 64% mature. Was that right?
Mary Puma: I think we said it was going to shift more towards mature in Q4. It was more of a 70-30...
Brian Chin: Okay. And maybe – I thought it was more of an expectation that memory would be stronger in the mix. Another question on gross margin – I’m sorry, go ahead.
Doug Lawson: Yes, the fourth quarter is going to be closer to 70-30 mature. For the year, it’s going to be weighted towards mature, but they’re not too far off from pretty equal. So it’s very similar to what we’ve seen the last few years. Quarter-to-quarter, it varies quite a bit, but when you look at it over the year-over-year, it’s been split relatively close down the middle.
Mary Puma: Yes, and I think the key takeaway is that everybody continues to think, or many people continue to think, that Axcelis is just a memory company, and it’s very important when you take a look at these statistics to understand that we have expanded our footprint significantly, not only to get more recipes at our existing memory customers and add some new memory customers. But we’ve really added a lot of footprint in the mature process technology area to the point where, as Doug said, it’s equivalent to a slightly higher percentage of our business overall for the year.
Brian Chin: Sure. Yes, that is impressive. A quick question on – just a question on gross margins, not really on the product side, more on the service side. We have noticed that year-to-date and in Q3, the service gross margin’s tracking pretty far below what they were last year. This is clearly less than 10% of your overall sales. But it is a little bit of a drag on the overall gross margin. So I’m kind of curious if you could explain sort of what that dynamic is this year and if that is something that can normalize or change next year.
Kevin Brewer: Yes, I mean, the only thing we really talk about is CS&I, which is the service, the spare parts, consumables, used tools upgrades, and that part of our business continues to be very accretive. The pure service part, which is the labor, which we – gets broke out, and that’s what you’re picking up in the financials, that does fluctuate back and forth. It is down a little bit this year, but it’s just kind of more around where the mix of stuff is happening right now. But overall, that impact really isn’t creating a drag on the overall CS&I business. And we are – we do talk a lot about what we’re doing on the system side, obviously, because that is where a lot of the lion’s share of the growth is coming from. But we also have made an investment in the service side of business this year in terms of developing and driving new upgrades to the field. And the upgrades are the things that really drive the margin higher on that side of the business. So we’re doing things over here to not only gain some additional revenue but certainly prop up the margins even higher around that CS&I side which includes the service space.
Brian Chin: Sure. At least, it does seem like it’s up a good amount this year. And maybe lastly, doubling back on – I think there was a question on China earlier in the queue. But just looking at the various initiatives that you have going on, Axcelis-specific as well as sort of the industry tailwinds. Throwing China in there, but also including the market share gains at potential new memory customers, penetration of advanced logic/foundry customers, maybe discontinuation of the trends and strong execution on the mature products. Looking at all those various initiatives, what do you think will be the biggest incremental growth driver for the company next year?
Mary Puma: Well, don’t forget reentering the Japanese market, that’s really the fourth big piece of our growth strategy to achieve our target business model. I think next year, we’re going to see ourselves continue to grow footprint and add some additional share at existing customers. But probably the biggest driver that is new to the mix would be China. There is a lot of activity in China right now. And as I said, we expect to win our fair share of that. So I think for 2018, that’s probably going to be the biggest driver.
Brian Chin: Okay. Thanks, Mary. Appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Duley from Steelhead Securities. Sir, your line is now open.
David Duley: Thanks for taking my question.
Kevin Brewer: Hey, Dave.
David Duley: I was wondering if you might take a stab at what you think the overall size of the implant market is going to be next year.
Doug Lawson: It’s going to be around $1 billion. So – I mean this market’s been $1 billion plus or minus $100 million for a long time, and we continue to see it that way. And we’ll continue to gain share of that $1 billion. That’s where our focus is.
David Duley: Okay. And the – you talked about your market share ending up, I guess, 27% or 28% of the overall market. What do you think you’ve been able to achieve in the big segment of the market in the part that the H addresses?
Mary Puma: What do we expect our market share to be for Purion H?
David Duley: Well, yes, the large part of the market, right, the part that you’re trying to penetrate. What do you think your market share is now? Or maybe give us a baseline of what it was last year.
Doug Lawson: We haven’t really broken out the H at this point. To be honest with you, Dave, this year really has been more focused on new customer penetrations than pure market share. It’s really setting up significant share gain next year. So honestly, we haven’t really looked at the exact number. And so we’re really looking at the full market with all the products at this point.
David Duley: Okay. And I guess kind of as a follow-on there, you keep mentioning you’re focused on penetrating new customers and getting new recipes of current customers. And it would seem like you had a very significant number both in 2016 and 2017 as far as new customers go and new recipes that you’ve outlined. So is there any reason to think that the trajectory of your market share gain changes based on all these new customer wins?
Doug Lawson: No, we – if you look at the plans within the long-term model at 32% and 40%, the trajectory is there. So we said in the script that the next two years or two years, we have a plan to achieve the model. We’ve got that on the share gain graph and so...
David Duley: I guess, say, you kind of have the customers in hand now as they ramp up to achieve those goals, I guess is what I’m ultimately digging at.
Doug Lawson: We have a lot of the customers to achieve those goals. There’s still more customers to be had. So Japan is open. There’s a lot of new customers coming online in China, and we’ve got leading-edge logic to crack. So we’ve still got a lot of doors to open, but we’re in a lot of places at this point with 28 fabs and 14 customers just in the last two years.
Kevin Brewer: But we still – we’ll continue to have evals outstanding and right into next year because, as Doug says, we have more to go after, and we’ve got those evals planned.
David Duley: Okay, final question from me is, as far as further penetration in Japan, I guess, to me that was significant progress that would be penetrating the memory customer there. When is there – do you have plans or targets as to when we should see progress on that front?
Mary Puma: Well, we continue to engage with a number of customers in Japan. And we feel like we’re making progress. We have run demos. We continue to get results and run additional wafers here in Beverly. So our target would be to show some progress in 2018.
David Duley: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Brian. We’re pleased with our third quarter performance and prospects for a strong year for both Axcelis and the industry. As always, I want to thank you for your continued support and hope to see you in the coming months. We will be attending the 8th Annual Craig-Hallum Alpha Select Conference in New York City on November 16, and we will be back in New York for the New York City Summit on December 6 and the Needham Growth Conference on January 2017 and 2018. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[-0.05598451262344473, 0.0036148939814586445];0.0036148939814586445;-0.05598451262344473;0
19;ACLS;2018-02-07;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the Company’s Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2017. My name is Amanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma’am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Amanda. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued earlier today, it is available on our Web site. Playback service will also be available on our Web site as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC’s safe harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. In this call, we will provide some non-GAAP financial information to allow for period-to-period comparisons given accounting events that occurred in the quarter. Reconciliation to GAAP can be found in the press release and investor presentation posted to our Web site today. The strong semiconductor market in 2017 provided a great backdrop for additional Purion market share growth. Systems revenue grew by 89% year-over-year with Purion representing 87% of this systems revenue. During the year, Axcelis shipped Purion systems to 18 new customer fabs. Seven of these sites represent new Purion customers, the other 11 locations are first in fab Purion placements by existing Purion customers. The increase of existing customers populating additional fabs with Purion is a strong indicator of its share growth potential. The year started with strong Purion XE and Purion VXE sales for 3D NAND image center and mature foundry logic applications. Purion H ramped throughout the year and by Q4 represented the highest percentage of shipped systems. Strong Purion H bookings have continued into 2018 and during the year, five new customers adopted Purion H and two existing customers added Purion H to a new fab. The Purion product family now have two of record status at seven of the top 10 CapEx spenders in the industry. Two of our 2018 objective penetrating advanced logic and re-entering Japan will provide access to the remaining three in the top 10. Purion H already has two of record status at five of the top 10, and we believe we have the opportunity to significantly increase this number in 2018. Regaining market share leadership in ion implantation remains our primary objective. With Purion technology now firmly rooted in the customer base, we have confidence we can achieve this. Our customers’ primary buying criteria is based on technology. Competitive pricing pressure should be seen as further proof of Purion's technology advantages and Axcelis' ability to take additional market share. 2018 is shaping up to be another strong year, driven once again by IoT, data storage and data analytics. We expect to continue to gain market share with a revenue target in 2018 of approximately $450 million. To achieve this revenue growth in 2018, we will focus on four objectives; grow our footprint within our existing customer base with a focus on large memory customers; establish Purion in the nascent domestic Chinese memory market; penetrate the advanced foundry logic market segment with Purion; and reenter the Japanese market, which represents approximately 15% of the ion implant TAM. Three out of four of these objectives are greenfield opportunities for Axcelis that can translate directly to market share gains. I'd like to take a moment to summarize a few of our fourth quarter 2017 financial results and provide Q1 guidance. Revenues for the quarter were $116.4 million with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47. Results for the quarter were above guidance and current consensus estimates. 2017 revenues were $410.6 million with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.48. Our systems mix in the quarter was 57% mature foundry logic, highlighting the continued strength of the Internet of Things. Memory comprised the remaining 43% of systems shipment. For the full year, our systems mix was 56% mature foundry logic and 44% memory. The geographic mix of our systems shipments were Korea 52%, China 20% and the U.S. and Europe 17%. Turning to guidance for the first quarter. We are forecasting revenues of between $115 million and $120 million. We expect gross margins of approximately 38%, operating income of $16 million to $17 million and EPS of $0.34 to $0.37, including a non-cash tax expense of $0.10. The industry is in a very strong sustained cycle and it appears that 2018 will be another good year. The cycle continues to be driven by IoT and the mature foundry logic market, data storage and the 3D NAND market and data analytics in the DRAM and advanced logic segment. New customers and new technologies are ramping in the memory market, opening prospects for Axcelis. With all of this activity, we are already seeing strong bookings into the second quarter. Now, I would like to turn it over to Kevin, to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. Axcelis delivered solid fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, driven by our highest revenue level in 10 years. In the year, we generated $56.3 million of cash from operations and ended the year with a cash balance of $140.9 million, up $63.2 million for the year. Strength in the overall semiconductor market continues to provide Axcelis with an opportunity to firmly establish Purion across a broader customer base. In the quarter, we recognized two evaluation units and shift one new Purion H evaluation system to multinational 3D NAND customer in China. In Q4, we executed a reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on 13 consecutive quarters of profitability, and a positive outlook for 2018 and beyond. This along with other related impacts resulted in a Q4 tax benefit of $81.6 million, or $2.39 per share. Our deferred tax assets will be used to offset future state and federal tax expense on U.S. profits until they are fully depleted. In Q4, we also recorded $6.2 million excess inventory reserve on legacy products, resulting from the success of our Purion. Our market share growth is our primary objective in 2018. Gross margin improvement remains a top priority within the business. We continue to make solid progress on supply chain, engineering and manufacturing cost of initiatives and increased our rolling fourth quarter average on systems standard margins by 1500 basis point since full launch of the Purion product line. As is typical, quarterly gross margin will continue to be influenced by the number of evaluation tools converted to revenue, the mix of system revenue versus CS&I revenue, the mix of products and customers and competitive pricing pressures will continue to gain momentum of the Purion H. Now, I'll review the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. Q4 revenue finished at $116.4 million compared to $104.5 million in Q3. Q4 systems sales was $75.8 million compared to $69.2 million in Q3. Q4 CS&I revenue finished at $40.6 million compared to $35.3 million in Q3, driven by higher spare parts and upgrades. Full year 2017 revenues finished at $410.6 million, up 54% compared to $267 million in 2016. System revenue for the year was $262.7 million, up 89% compared to $139.3 million in 2016. Q4 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 64% of our total sales compared to 80% in Q3, but one of these customer is 10% or above. Q4 system bookings were $103.8 million compared to $83.2 million in Q3, for the Q4 book-to-bill ratio of 1.35 versus 1.18 in Q3. Backlog in the fourth quarter, including deferred revenue finished at $87.3 million compared to $58.5 million in Q3. Q4 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $26 million compared to $25.9 million in Q3. SG&A in the quarter was $15.1 million with R&D at $10.9 million. In Q1, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately 25% of revenues and in line with our target business model. Q4 gross margin was 31.5%, which included an excess inventory reserve of $6.2 million. Excluding this reserve, gross margin would have been 36.8% compared to 38% in Q3. As we discussed in our Q3 earnings call, Q4 gross margin would be impacted by a significantly higher Purion H shipment that currently have lower standard margin than other Purion products. We are continuing to make good progress with our cost out initiatives and are aggressively working to close the gap between Purion H and other in Purion products. You can find additional details on our standard margins in our investor presentation. Full year 2017 gross margin was 36.6% compared to 37.3% in 2016. Excluding the impact of the excess inventory reserve, full year gross margin would have been 38.1%, our highest annual level in 11 years. In Q1, we expect gross margin to be approximately 38%. Operating profit in Q4 was $10.8 million compared to $13.8 million in Q3. Excluding the $6.2 million excess inventory reserve, operating profit would have been $16.9 million. Full year 2017 operating profit was $47.8 million compared to $16.6 million in 2016. Excluding the excess inventory reserve, full year operating profit would have been $54 million, up 225% over 2016. Q4 net income was $91.7 million or $2.68 per share compared to $0.35 per share in Q3. In the quarter, we realized a tax benefit of $81.6 million to principally for the release of the tax valuation allowance and related impacts, and recorded an excess inventory reserve of $6.2 million. Excluding these items, net income would have been $16.2 million or $0.47 per share. Full year net income was $127 million compared to net income of $11 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of the previously discussed items, full year net income would have been $49.5 million or $1.48 per share compared to $0.36 in 2016, an increase of 311%. We are guiding Q1 earnings of $0.34 to $0.37 per share, including a non-cash tax expense of $0.10. Q4 inventory ended at $120.5 million compared to $123.4 million in Q3. Q4 inventory turns, excluding the evaluation tools, finished at 2.7 compared to 2.2 in Q3. Q4 accounts payable were $32.6 million compared to $33.6 million in Q3. Q4 receivables was $75.3 million compared to $69.8 million in Q3, driven by the timing of shipments. 2017 year end cash finished at $140.9 million compared to $120.1 million in Q3, and 2016 year-end cash finished at $77.7 million. We expect Q1 cash to finish at approximately $145 million. Axcelis delivered significant improvement in full year and quarter operating results, thanks to the hard work of all our employees and strong demand for our products. In 2016, we penetrated 18 new customer sales with Purion and drove the highest revenue and operating profit in 10 years. Our cash generation in the year further strengthened our balance sheet, which allows us to continue to make critical investments to grow the business. We are now focused on 2018 and beyond share gain and improving gross margins are our top priorities, thank you. I will now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. Our customers have a choice in implant and as the number show, they are choosing Axcelis. They choose Axcelis for Purion platform technology, for solutions tailored to their needs in the form of Purion product extensions and to the innovation benefit they gain from a more competitive ion implant market. I'd also like to thank our employees and their families for our success last year. Without their dedication and support, none of our achievements would be possible. Next month marks the company's 40th anniversary. The journey began in 1978 in a shed in Middleton Massachusetts. Our founders knew two things; they wanted to build a high current implanter; and they wanted to be disruptive. They didn't realize it then but they were already starting to tackle problems that would lay the foundation for the connected world we live in today. Since that day, the company has led the implant industry through the introduction of innovative technology and its breadth of product lines. The world around us is changing fast and our technology helps drive that change. Many thanks to all of our stakeholders, employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders for your support and commitment. We have accomplished a lot here in our first 40 years and we look forward to continuing this success moving forward. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Edwin Mok of Needham and Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: So my first question I think more recently at a conference you guys talked about $450 million revenue number for this year. So you guys are finding you're pretty strong and imply that pretty cool, perhaps your run rate is actually gone above that right. Is that where the -- walk us through how you think about the year progress and if that 450 is still a starting point or anyway you can describe that?
Mary Puma: Edwin, the addition for us right now as I mentioned in the script is that we have pretty good visibility into Q2, but beyond that -- so that would be the second half of the year, we really don’t have visibility and that’s something that’s actually quite normal for us at this point in the year. So the issue at this point is that we can't really make a call on the second half of the year, but we have enough confidence in the projects that are out there and the strength of the Purion platform that the $450 million revenue is the right revenue to target in the year. And again, it's around $450 million, so we’ll just have to play it out and as we get further into the year, we can likely provide more color on that.
Edwin Mok: Second question I have, I guess question for you to have in -- in first quarter, you guys guided for gross margin to basically recover to 38%. But from your commentary, it sounds like you have a lot more into Purion H, which is still the lowest gross margin product. What allow you to push to margin back to 38%? And should we expect more improvement beyond that?
Kevin Brewer: In our targeted model, we did say that we were targeting 39%. So 38% Edwin is right in line with where we want to be at this point in time. As you point out, we do have a lot of momentum with Purion H, and in the quarter Purion H still represents a fairly large number of the shipments. We’re making progress on cost-out that’s the one lever that we can control entirely right now, and we’re pushing the teams aggressively too, so we can do the grind work cost out of these. So based on the cost improvement we’ve made and then the mix we got coming out 38% is where I think we’ll be. And again, we’re still targeting that 39% on the $450 million model, which is what we’re running at this year.
Edwin Mok: Last question I have, always you guys have fund these well, '17 was a really strong growth year clearly in share there. Have you started to see increased competition from, not just from the large competitor out there of the largest company out there, but also from the Japanese competitor? Have you seen like competition from either front and what are you guys doing to address potentially more aggressive boost by those competitors?
Mary Puma: So I don’t think we’ve seen any significant change in the competitive landscape. Our primary competitors Applied Materials, which shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody. And I would say infrequently run into some of the more niche players. But again, the market share that we’ve been taking away to get to -- I think we ended up at 27.4% based on the $1 billion TAM, really has come from Applied.
Edwin Mok: Again, you don’t think that -- or you haven’t seen at least Applied starting get more aggressive on commercial term pricing and potentially new product offering?
Mary Puma: At the end of the day, we all know that customers ultimately select products based on technology. And the Purion products are very competitive for a multitude of applications. So we have talked about how we’ve seen some pricing pressure. And we expect that that’s a near term phenomenon as we gain market share, particularly as we gain market share with the Purion H. But we believe that when we reached market share leadership, we think that pricing pressure will ease up. And again, it's all about the technology, and Purion is winning. So we feel like we've got superior technology.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley.
Peter Peng: This is Peter Peng calling in for Craig Ellis, and thanks for taking my questions. Under $1 billion implant target, just wondering you were talking about a double-digit WFE growth and 85% of that is memory driven. So why wouldn’t we argue for something similar to that given that DRAM incentives and NAND intentionally is highest for prior implanters?
Doug Lawson: Implanters are primarily -- competitive platform for implanters is primarily on productivity. And so that's -- unfortunately that takes away from a pure one-for-one TAM growth as you look at WFE growth. So that's the primary factor.
Peter Peng: And if I do the revenues and back out into the share gain, it seems like its 400 basis point of share gains from 2017 to 2018. Given that you laid out four initiatives, should I kind of be assuming 100 basis points for each initiative or should I be placing more on existing memory customer versus penetration of logic, how should I think about that?
Doug Lawson: Well, I don’t know if you can necessarily deviate up evenly. I think the best way to look at it is existing customer base is obviously, they have their two of record, we’re working with them on additional recipes. And as they add wafer starts, we’re two of record. So that's the most likely place where you gain share most quickly. When we look at China, we have a very strong base in China as they build, which are expected to build especially in the second part of the year pretty aggressively then we would expect we would get our fair share business there. The advanced logic and Japanese markets are longer term within the model. And so we are hoping that we’ll ship tools and have evaluation units go out in 2018, and that would give us the opportunity for substantial revenue as we go into '19 and '20. So they're really more critical to the $550 million model than to the $450 million. So I mean that's the best way to look at it. I'm not naturally you can deviate up, because there’s a lot of projects for each of those segments.
Peter Peng: And just on the first half of revenue expectations, given that it's memory loaded first half. Should we be thinking that the similar for Axcelis that it's going to be memory heavy on the first half and versus…
Doug Lawson: No, I mean we have, typically for the last three to four years now, been split pretty evenly annually between the mature process foundry and logic type customers and memory. And we continue to see that split pretty strong and pretty evenly. So it varies quarter-to-quarter to some degree, but you shouldn't assume -- make the assumption that we’ll be very heavily weighted towards one of the other in any of the given quarters.
Peter Peng: Okay, so it’s more equally balanced.
Kevin Brewer: Well, the thing that you have to look at is that the implant technology, again based on the fact that it’s really productivity driven and it’s very device driven, has a lot more opportunity in the mature market and in the older foundries than many of the other process tools. So that's one of the key reasons why we see that difference in weighting.
Peter Peng: One more question before I hop back into the queue. The pricing pressure. Is that a statement to the Purion H product or is that also applicable to the Purion XE?
Mary Puma: It's mostly a function of the Purion H. We're gaining pretty rapid market share with the Purion H. I mean if you look back, we only introduced the product at the end of 2014 and here we are by the end of 2017 with having the Purion as a process tool of record in seven out of the 10 largest CapEx spenders. So we've talked before how it’s the most rapidly adopted product in Axcelis' history. So it’s something that's happened very quickly and has attracted some, noticed by our competitors. But again, it’s all about the technology, the Purion H is very strong competitive technology with multiple advantages for our customers. And so again, there's some pressure here in the near term but we think longer term that's going to subside and we're going to just continue to win with Purion.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab of Craig Hallum. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Tyler on behalf of Christian, thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. So first, the valuation tool that you're shipping to China. Can you help me with the timing of that? Gross margin guidance that you pointed 38%, am I right to assume that that’s not been recognized in Q2 and that would probably be recognized in early Q1 -- it would be recognized in Q2 then?
Kevin Brewer: Well, typically evaluation tools are anywhere from six to 12 months before they’re recognized. So you're correct in assuming that would not be in the Q1 numbers. It’d be a future quarter, six to 12 months is a typical ease out.
Unidentified Analyst: And then on the same lines of previous question, just for seasonality through the year. Earlier today another peer in the semiconductor space discussed what they thought semi-equipment CapEx to be strong 2018, but it'd be front end loaded. Do you agree with that, could CapEx improve through the back half of the year?
Doug Lawson: I think it's really a function of visibility Tyler. And as Mary said, earlier we have good visibility in the first couple of quarters, actually a little bit longer than -- a little bit deeper than we normally do. And so at this point, it's really hard for us to judge exactly which projects are going to move faster or slower as we get into the second half. There's a lot of opportunity out there, a lot of people building shelves and there has not been a change in the demand on the memory side. That was highlighted in some recent memory company announcements. And as we talked about the IoT and the mature technology continues to be very strong for implant. As a function of the fact that they need faster and more productive implanters to be able to support the growing number of products and devices in their fabs.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: First in regards to the opportunity with the indigenous Chinese manufacturers that you talked about -- talked about the shipping of an evaluation system. I guess two twofold, one, how many more do you see potential evaluations in 2018 with other Chinese memory vendors? And maybe for Kevin in terms of the cost, the multinationals are well-established in China, you probably support and service them pretty strongly with the infrastructure you have in place. But how much do you have to expand the Chinese infrastructure to serve the local vendors, which tend to be a little more spread out?
Doug Lawson: Just the evaluation we would actually went to multinational so we have shift tools in the quarter to the domestic memory customers. But those aren’t the eval, the eval went through multinational, just to clarify that. As far as the staffing requirements and so forth to supported it, it is something that we’ve talked about we have been investing pretty heavily over the last year as these new projects have come up. And I'll let Kevin comment additionally on that.
Mary Puma: Patrick, there are additional units that will go out to some of these new memory manufacturers in China, likely in 2018 and some of them they still into 2019, again based on the timing that Doug talked about, it’s just simply a matter of when the projects are going to start up.
Doug Lawson: So Patrick, we did have infrastructure in China. We did also last year continue to talk about adding that infrastructure. I think we made some really good in roads in 2017 building things up. There is still more plan for this year. But that all fits within the 25% of revenue and OpEx model that we have out there for our $450 million target. So we are still investing, but again its covered. It's not outside of what we have in our model.
Patrick Ho: And maybe and my follow up question and maybe again for you Kevin in terms of the GSS business, which continues to show growth year-over-year. And given the adoption of Purion and the rapid pace that you’re seeing. What kind of qualitative commentary can you give on the GSS opportunity, particularly in 2018 given the rapid growth assistance in 2017?
Kevin Brewer: So if I look at the whole aftermarket business, which has huge tools and spare parts and service and upgrades, there is no doubt that more tools we shift that adds to that base business. But we rebase line that if we include our implanters and strip products it’s probably 3000 tools out there. So although we’re shipping new tools though and then that we will add to this year, which it’s not going to spike it. So where we’re really looking to grow Patrick is on the upgrade business, because we have such a large install base. And a lot of these tools are very old because an implanter last for real on time. We’ve added quite a bit of resources, engineering team and developed what we consider high margin upgrades to really push the revenue higher there. So yes, Purion will add to the base, but the faster growth is going to be coming through upgrades and a little bit through winning back some business that the third parties have captured. We’ve got some innovative ideas having go about to and that with designs and things.
Mary Puma: And particularly, the expanse and consumer was there…
Operator: Our next question is from the line of David Duley of Steelhead.
David Duley: I just had a couple of clarifications just as far as 2017, the market share that you achieved in '17 was approximately is less than on your presentation for 2018, the $450 million of revenues that you planned. What market share will that be as well?
Mary Puma: So the market share in '17 was approximately 27%. The market share that we associate with the $450 million revenue model is about 32%.
David Duley: And then can you give us an idea now, I think you've mentioned in the past, what percentage of systems shipments are Purion H?
Doug Lawson: Well, we haven't given a percent, but we did say that the Q4 shipments were the highest month or highest quarter ever of the shipments. As a matter effect in Q4 we shipped almost as many tools in Q4 as a rest of the whole first half of the year for Purion H. But we don’t give an exact percent and then in Q1, there is still a high number of Purion H and the mix that's planned for Q1.
David Duley: And then could you give us an idea of where your current lead times are and have they expanded? And then the final question from me Kevin is could you just walk us through the P&L impact of brining that I think $80 million of deferred tax assets just back on to the balance sheet. How is that going to impact the P&L statement, going forward?
Kevin Brewer: So in terms of lead times, our supply chain is still doing a great job keeping up with it. So our lead times typically on a shipment sell tool where we have long lead material already driving and we keep a certain amount of long lead driving, we can turn a tool within a quarter, because the factory cycle time is only about four weeks on the shipment sale. And the rest is really about getting the long lead here we have to just take the short lead and most of the materials 50 days or less. In terms of the impact from the valuation allowance that get reversed. So we now have an asset and in the press release you can see on the balance sheet the asset that’s there. We will use that asset going forward to offset any cash expense we have from taxes. So the new tax laws is biggest and back to our company was pretty much a fact that we are tax payer now, we're in a 21% tax bracket. There is a lot of other things in there with toll taxes and stuff, but they really had minimal impact on our business. So the biggest impact of that data going forward is that we have a fairly large deferred tax assets sitting on the balance sheet now for $81 million and some change and for every dollar tax as we have to pay going forward, we will offset that. So we will be a non-cash tax payer for a good amount of time. Obviously, the better the business does the faster we burn enough, but we will apply those going forward. So the P&L will be impacted. We're going to have a tax expense on the P&L, but then we're going to turn around and it will be a non-cash expense, because we'll offset it with that asset that we have the deferred tax asset.
David Duley: So will you be breaking out this impact going forward on a pro forma basis, so we can kind of -- on apples-to-apples?
Kevin Brewer: So we try to do this today. We said we had $0.10 of tax impact, so pretty much what we're saying is we guided 34 to 37 prior to the reversal, we've been guiding 44 to 47 but we got this $0.10 of tax impact now, at the P&L low, but again not the cash level.
David Duley: And just a final clarification, you mentioned you talked about your cycle times in your factory and lead times for a bunch of different things. But right now, someone gives you an order -- how many weeks is it before you deliver it?
Kevin Brewer: So we keep -- we have planning material bunch along lead materials, so that's assuming long leads here and we have a good amount of long lead here. Short lead material is all less than 60 days and our build time is four weeks on shipments. So in the worst case, it’s three months but it can be less than that. So it's very possible for us to turn tools within a quarter if we get the order early in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Miller of Benchmark. Your line is open.
Mark Miller: I had a question, you were talking about growing the upgrade business. Will that have a positive impact on GSS margins and where are the margins relative for GSS and relative to overall company margins?
Doug Lawson: The only thing we ever say is that the GSS margins are very accretive. And the answer is yes. The upgrades will grow those margins higher. If I look at know the business, the upgrades are some of the higher margins when you look at all the buckets within that side of the business between used tools, spare parts, consumables, service. So the upgrades are some of the higher gross margin pieces of that business.
Mark Miller: On the local Chinese where manufacturers coming out this year, what percent of those will be just be in power protection and going into production ramp in 2019. What's your estimate? How many will actually be in full production this year versus full production 2019?
Mary Puma: I think most of them actually are starting up pilot lines. The tools that are getting shipped now aren't going into pilot line. So it’s going to take them a while to work out the kinks, especially given that some of them have actually developed the technology themselves. So there's a lot of work they have to do before they go into full production.
Mark Miller: And then related to that, what do you think geographically will be your sales mix in 2018, will it be similar to 2017 with Korea being 57% or 60% of it?
Mary Puma: No, we expect that China will actually have the largest percentage of our business or be the largest percentage of our business in 2018. Korea would still be strong, but China should surpass it this year.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I am showing no further questions [Operator Instructions]. And this does conclude today's Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call over to Miss. Mary Puma who will make further closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thanks Amanda. So we’re looking forward to an exciting year for Axcelis and for the industry. As always, I want to thank you for your continued support and hope to see you in the coming months at one of several investor trips we have planned. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[-0.03409090909090906, 0.07270242884531997];0.07270242884531997;-0.03409090909090906;0
20;ACLS;2018-05-03;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company’s results for the First Quarter of 2018. My name is Takiya, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference maybe recorded. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma’am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Takiya. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release, issued earlier today, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website, as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC’s Safe Harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During Q1 Axcelis made significant progress toward our goal of regaining market share leadership in ion implantation with the Purion platform. We announced the first shipment of Purion H High Current Implanter to a new foundry logic customer for development of their most advanced logic nodes. We also entered into a distribution and support agreement with the SCREEN Semiconductor Solutions to bring the complete Purion product family to the Japanese market. These two opportunities have opened nearly one-third of the ion implant market to Axcelis. This represents more than $300 million in potential systems revenue previously unavailable to the company. Purion has tool of record status as seven of the top 10 CapEx spenders in the industry. Our advanced logic shipment and SCREEN agreement have opened opportunities at the remaining three customers. This facilitates a continuing momentum shift in the ion implant market to Purion. Revenue for the first quarter was our highest in over 10 years at $122.2 million. These results were above guidance and current consensus estimate. Our systems mix in the quarter was 37% matured foundry logic, while memory comprised the remaining 63% of the systems shipment, with 36% of total shipments for DRAM and 27% for FLASH. Memory remains strong and is expected to represent more than 50% of the systems mix in the second quarter. The geographic mix of our systems shipments, where Korea 52%, China 20%, the U.S. and Europe 7%, and the Rest of World 21%, China continues to be an active geography. During the quarter we announced our first orders for Purion from a new domestic Chinese memory manufacturer. Turning to guidance for the second quarter we are forecasting revenues of between $114 million and $118 million. We expect gross margins of approximately 38%, operating income of $15.5 million to $16.5 million, and EPS of $0.34 to $0.36 after a non-cash tax expense of $0.10. We continue to maintain our $450 million revenue model as our 2018 target. This will result in further market share growth coming from both established Purion customers and increasing demand from the new Purion penetrations made in 2017. The industry remains in a strong sustained cycle that continues to be fueled by IoT in the mature foundry/logic market, data storage and the 3D NAND market, and data analytics in the DRAM and advanced logic segment. The strong semiconductor market in 2017 provided a great backdrop for increasing Purion market share. This is continuing in 2018. During Q1, we increased the Purion footprint with shipments to three new customer fabs. Two of these sites represent new Purion customers, one of which is our first Purion shipment to an advanced logic fab. The other location is a first in fab Purion placement by an existing Purion customer. This brings total new Purion penetrations since the beginning of 2016 to 35. Let me take a moment to discuss our four key 2018 objectives in more detail. The first tool will drive 2018 revenue. Number one, growing our footprint within our existing customer base with a focus on large memory customers. And number two, establishing Purion in the nascent domestic Chinese memory market. Our efforts on these two objectives are going well. New fab and customer penetrations in 2017 are now generating follow-on orders. We continue to work closely with existing customers on new recipe opportunities on their advanced process flows. For example, in Q1, we shipped a Purion H evaluation unit to a large memory manufacturer to prove performance advantages that will expand our footprint and increase our percentage of implants spent with this customer. In terms of China, we have multiple new Purion customer shipments planned in 2018. And we announced our first orders for Purion from a domestic Chinese memory manufacturer. In addition to the emerging memory market, our business in the mature foundry/logic segment in China remained strong. The third and fourth 2018 objectives are focused on our longer-term, $550 million target business model and ultimately, regaining ion implant market share leadership. Number three, penetrating the advanced foundry/logic market segment with Purion. And number four, reentering the Japanese market. These two markets represent approximately one-third of the ion implant market that has not been accessible to Axcelis. In the first quarter, we have made significant progress toward achieving these two objectives. In Q1, we shipped a Purion H evaluation unit to a leading-edge foundry/logic customer for their most advanced logic development efforts. Purion H was selected for this project, based on architectural advantages over the competition. These advantages will allow the customer to solve some very difficult process issues, while achieving significantly higher productivity and lower cost of ownership compared to the competition. In addition, we announced a multi-pronged partnership with SCREEN Semiconductor Solutions, formerly known as Dainippon Screen that we expect to accelerate our first Purion shipment into Japan. SCREEN is the sixth-largest capital equipment supplier in the world. The company is based in Kyoto, Japan with over 3,000 employees worldwide. SCREEN brings to Axcelis a strong sales and service organization with deep ties to the Japanese customer base. Purion systems are well suited for key Japanese products, such as memory devices, image sensors and silicon carbide power devices. As part of the partnership, Axcelis will establish a demo and applications lab, featuring a Purion H high current system at SCREEN’s process, technology center in Hikone, Japan. Additionally, the two companies have agreed to work together on advanced technology development in multiple areas. Now I would like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. Axcelis delivered solid first quarter financial results, beating both company and analyst consensus estimates. Revenue, operating profit and cash all finished at the highest levels in over 10 years. Strength in the overall semiconductor market continues to provide Axcelis an opportunity to firmly establish Purion across a broader customer base. In the quarter, we shipped two new Purion H evaluation units; one to our first advanced logic customer and the second to an existing memory customer for work on additional recipes for advanced memory devices. Gross margin in the quarter was above our guidance driven by lower system costs. Higher volume and numerous margin improvement initiatives should continue to improve our Purion product costs. In Q1 we also continue to tightly control our spending, but we will invest in areas that enable us to achieve our revenue growth objectives. In our first quarter we opened the door to $300 million in potential new revenue for Axcelis and advanced logic in the Japanese market. Over the next couple of years we will allocate additional capital and resources for setting up our applications lab mostly at SCREEN’s Process Technology Center, and stepped step up our R&D efforts to support advanced logic. Q1 opened significant opportunities for Axcelis. We plan to take full advantage of them. Now I’ll review the first quarter 2018 financial results. Q1 revenue finished at $122.2 million compared to $116.4 million in Q4. Q1 system sales are $85.5 million compared to $75.8 million in Q4. Q1 CS&I revenue finished at $36.7 million compared to $40.6 million in Q4. Q1 sales for our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 87% of our total sales compared to 64% in Q4, where two of these customers are at 10% or above. Q1 system bookings were $90.3 million compared to $103.8 million in Q4, while the Q1 book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 versus 1.35 in Q4. Backlog in Q1 including deferred revenue finished at $89.4 million compared to $87.3 million in Q4. Q1 combined SG&A and R&D spending was 23.4% of revenue compared to 22.3% in Q4. SG&A in the quarter was $16.4 million with R&D at $12.2 million. In Q2, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately 25% of revenues and in line with our target business model. Q1 gross margin was 38.6% compared to 31.5% in Q4. Our Q4 gross margin was negatively impacted by an excess inventory reserve adjustment. In Q2, we expect gross margin to be approximately 38% impacted by higher mix of Purion H. We have detailed multi-year gross margin improvement roadmaps in place. Higher volume, value engineering, supply chain rationalization and lean manufacturing will all continue to play a critical role in driving the lower Purion product cost. Operating profit in Q1 was $18.5 million compared to $10.8 million in Q4, which includes a charge for excess inventory. Q1 net income was $13.9 million or $0.41 per share compared to $91.7 million or $2.68 per share in Q4. Our Q4 net income was impacted by a tax benefit of $81.6 million to principally to the release of a tax valuation allowance and related impacts. We are guiding Q2 earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.36 after an expected non-cash tax expense of $0.10. Q1 inventory ended at $135 million compared to $120.5 million in Q4. Q1 inventory turns, excluding evaluation tools, finished at 2.4 compared to 2.7 in Q4. Q1 accounts payable were $43.4 million, compared to $32.6 million in Q4 due to the timing of material receipts. Q1 receivables were $75.6 million compared to $75.3 million in Q4. Q1 cash finished at $148.5 million compared to $140.9 million in Q4. We expect Q2 cash to finish at approximately $154 million. Q1 was a great quarter for Axcelis. We delivered quarter-over-quarter improvement in revenue, gross margin, operating profit and cash. In 2018, we are focused on driving higher revenues through share gain, improving gross margins to cost out initiatives and solid cash generation required for investments expected to drive future growth. Thank you. Now I would turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. Our customers are choosing Axcelis Purion platform because they realize the value or innovation benefit they gain from having competition between two strong implant suppliers. We have all watched this play out as Axcelis is growing implant market share from approximately 5% to 27% over the last few years. In Q1, we put additional pieces in place that we need to complete our march toward market share leadership. Our agreement with SCREEN and our shipment to a leading-edge foundry/logic customer has given us access to $300 million of implant opportunity, meaning that the entire $1 billion implant TAM is now available to Axcelis. Furthermore, our screen agreement not only provides Axcelis an on trade to the Japanese market, it also gives us access to a world-class Japanese facility in which we will outfit a demo and training center. This will allow us to better serve the needs of all of our Asian customers. The agreement also builds upon our desire to provide our customers with solutions to better meet their emerging manufacturing challenges through our technical collaboration. We are confident about 2018 and the continued growth and profitability that we believe we can deliver over the next couple of years at the $550 million revenue model. We are also excited about identifying new technologies, products and businesses that will allow us to continue a trajectory of profitable growth that our shareholders have come to expect from Axcelis. With that, I’d like to open it up for questions. Takiya?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good job for the quarter. First, actually just a housekeeping, just to clarify. I think last quarter you guys talked about you have a step up in tax expenses here, but not for cash taxes still remain really low. I think this quarter, you just report your GAAP number, you’re not going to back out from [indiscernible], I just want to clarify that’s the case. And how – tax rate is going to stay at this 20% range going forward?
Kevin Brewer: Yes, so we are reporting GAAP numbers, Edwin, and this quarter, our tax rate was 20.4%. So we feel that we’ll be in the 20% to 21% range going forward. And the impact – you’re right, we’re paying taxes now, but it’s non-cash because we have this big deferred tax asset on the balance sheet now. So it will be a while before we use that up. So it is impacting the P&L because it shows an expense. But then we don’t pay the expense so we don’t pay the cash.
Edwin Mok: Okay. Great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then moving on the business, we’ve heard some companies, kind of talking about maybe within the memory space there’s some shift in kind of equipment spending or shift in capital expansion from NAND the DRAM. Just wondering if you guys are seeing that? And as that progress through the year, how does that affect your business?
Mary Puma: So Edwin, we really haven’t seen any major shift between DRAM and NAND. It’s very common for things – for shipments to move around quarter-to-quarter. But we really haven’t seen any changes in the market, as I just mentioned. We think overall demand remain strong both for memory and also the mature process technology market. And what we’re doing is just we continue to monitor the timing of these customer investments very closely. But customers are continuing to tell us that they feel confident about this being a sustained cycle and that those investments are going to take place.
Edwin Mok: Okay, all right. Can I ask you a question about the agreement with SCREEN? You mentioned that you’re placing Purion H product in that customer site. I was wondering, it seems like there are opportunities that you’re going after like the end customer, the chipmakers, serial memory, CMOS unit central or silicon carbide, seems like that’s a high energy type of application more than high current. Just curious why you’re placing a high current to there? And then – with that agreement – does that – does those come with slightly gross – low gross margin because I guess if you to give up some margin to SCREEN as a distributor?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So, on the first question, Edwin, we made a decision to put Purion H in the lab in Japan. It’s the largest TAM, it’s used for a lot more implant applications in high energy implanter, and so well the image sensors and NAND market definitely do use this higher energy. We can do the work for their applications back here in Beverly pretty easily. So what we’ll be doing in the lab there is have a Purion H implanters, but we will have a Purion XE front-end which will allow us to do full training with the Purion XE which is a little bit wider or bigger around the system just based on the size of its alone. Relative to the financial question, we haven’t released the exact terms of the agreement, but it is a representative agreement, so we will be paying them a commission. So it shouldn’t impact the gross margins.
Edwin Mok: I see. Okay, great, that’s helpful. Lastly, just on the advanced logic win there, congrats for make – winning that eval position. Just curious, what kind of timeframe for that? And is it possible to describe what node are we talking? Is it more like a 5-nanometer node or is it account for current advanced node?
Mary Puma: So we’re not going to identify the node, because it’s obviously confidential in terms of the customer we’re dealing with and the development that they are using the Purion H for. Beyond that, typically a logic evaluation will last one year and that is in fact the length of this evaluation agreement, that has happened in the past, I think to be conservative, we should probably think of thinking revenue in 2019. But I’m not going to rule out the fact that we could actually ship additional Purion H to that customer this year.
Edwin Mok: Great, I think that’s all I have. Thank you, I appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Mary, maybe just a follow-up on some of the comments you made regarding China, and particularly specifically the domestic markets. Where are you getting the biggest interest right now, on the memory side or the mature technology logic side, given that that region has both of those markets growing at a pretty rapid pace?
Mary Puma: We’re actually getting a lot of interest from both sides, both customer segments. There is interest from I call the domestic, they are some of the new domestic memory suppliers and we talked about how we actually got our first orders from one of those customers in Q1. We also have a lot of interest from some of the more established, I call them, maybe the global memory company. So the memory side is actually quite strong. And then on the mature process technology side of the business, we have a lot of business in China, we’ve talked about that before and we have an excessive installed base. And we’re seeing those customers continue to show interest in Purion and place additional orders also.
Patrick Ho: Great, that’s helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question in terms of your services business, maybe also related to China somewhat. How do you look at that opportunity on the services front, given that that’s an area where you guys have capitalized upon with your current installed base, but China also tends to be, I guess, a more region where they tend to have more those types of third-party vendors or local shops there. How do you plan to penetrate the services market? And keep a lot of that in-house for yourself versus the vendors out there?
Mary Puma: I actually I don’t think we’ve seen it, the competition to be any stronger in China than some of the other Asian markets that we’ve gone into. One of the things that clear is especially at some of these new fabs where the operators are new, the management teams are actually looking towards or looking to Axcelis to provide support, both in terms of service and spare part and consumables, because in some cases again, the operators are new and the locations are remote, and so in terms of being able to come online as quickly as possible, I would say we’re actually getting probably our fair share or maybe even more of our fair share in these situations.
Patrick Ho: Right. Final question for me for Kevin in terms of gross margins. I think you talked about the progression to 40% gross margins that has been pushed out somewhat. But as we look at 2018 as a whole, as you get some of these cost out programs and some of the savings you talked about, would there be a potential trajectory to increasing gross margins as the year progresses?
Kevin Brewer: Yes, Patrick, we still believe that 39%, which we put in our target model is achievable this year. And when I look at that, I’m thinking more along the lines of an average of 39%. So the answer to your question is, yes, as we move forward, I expect to continue to see these margins creep up. We’ve got all the usual things that impact us with mix in evals and stuff. But at these revenue levels, an eval recognize and has a lot less impact on margins versus on lower revenue. So, yes, I I’m very comfortable with that, what we have in the model 39% is where we can get to this year. And then beyond that, as you pointed out, if you look at our $500 million model, 40% plus is where we would expect to be.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Patrick.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from David Duley of Steelhead Securities. Your line is now open.
David Duley: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions on memory spending. I was just curious, have you seen an increase in overall DRAM spending? Many of the other large equipment guys have talked about DRAM spending being better than expected, and I was wondering if what you had seen thus far?
Mary Puma: Yes, I think, versus what we had anticipated coming into the year, we have seen DRAM spending increase. So I think that what we’re seeing is pretty consistent with what others are telling you.
David Duley: Okay. And I’m assuming that’s kind of two sources of increase a little bit more perhaps from China. And then a little bit more from non-Chinese customers, the Korean guys who seem to be ramping up the fab or two.
Mary Puma: Again, I think we’re seeing the same things that everybody else is seeing, so those regions would be among the areas where we would see some strong DRAM spending at this point.
David Duley: Okay. And as far as the mix in Q2 between memory and foundry/logic, could you repeat that again? I think you mentioned it. And then perhaps, if you could provide some guidance what you think the mix would be for the second of the calendar year?
Mary Puma: Okay. So these numbers, by the way, we made a change to this right before we read the script. So these are the actual numbers, and I apologize if they’re slightly different. The foundry/logic is 36% in terms of shipments, and the memory is 64%, and the split would be 37% DRAM and 27% Flash.
David Duley: Okay. And that’s the same mix, that was the mix you had in the March quarter. What do you expect the mix to be in the Q2 and in the second half?
Mary Puma: Well, we don’t really forecast what for the mix is going to be. We did say in the script that we expect our memory shipments to be over 50%. So it will still remain predominantly memory, although, it may not be quite as strong as that 64% that we had in Q1.
David Duley: Okay. And then could you take a stab at if you could take a guess at what you think your first half’s revenue of this year will look versus the second half? Is that going to be – would you expect a decline in overall memory spending? Or is that going to be different for you guys?
Mary Puma: The first half of the year continues to be strong, and I think that’s witnessed by our results from Q1 and also our guidance for Q2. And in 2018 we’re focused on achieving our $450 million revenue target. At this point, we have limited visibility into the second half, but if you look at what’s going on right now in the marketplace there’s a lot of fab construction underway so we’re confident that spending will occur and we just continue to monitor the timing of those customers and customer investments very closely. I think the other thing is that we are actually focusing beyond 2018, and we’re pretty excited about the fact that we are getting all the pieces in place now for the $550 million target business model, with the first shipment of the Purion H to a leading-edge foundry/logic customer, and then also the distribution and support agreements and other elements of our collaboration with the SCREEN. So I think we feel very confident about where we’re going in 2018, and even moving forward over the next couple of years.
David Duley: Another question from me is as far as China goes and the domestic memory guys, do you think you’re going to achieve a 40% share of those new customers as they come online given your market position?
Mary Puma: Again, I’m not going to conjecture it at what the market share is going to be. It’s pretty hard to tell based on the fact that we don’t exactly know what the spending is going to be. But we continue to say that we think we’re going to get our fair share of that business. As I mentioned earlier, we have a position at both the domestic and global memory customers as well as the mature foundry/logic guy. So I think it’s going to be a big year in China across a number of different customer segments.
David Duley: Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, David.
Mary Puma: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Miller of the Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller: Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on your results for March.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, Mark.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Mark Miller: You’re welcome. As memory scales up to a greater number of layers per device, do you see increased use of ion implants as we go to next generation device with more layers?
Kevin Brewer: The use of ion implant is a little bit wafer-based layer relative to the NAND process. Although, we do continue to work with customers and partners looking at ways that implant could be used in material modification applications to help with some of the difficult action patterning steps involved in that. But currently, it’s really driven by the transistor definition on the NAND devices.
Mark Miller: Okay. This non-cash tax expansion, does – sounded like that’s going to extend through the rest of this year? What about 2019?
Kevin Brewer: Well, it’s going to be based on our earnings, right. But we have $81.6 million I think it was a number that we put up on the deferred tax asset reserve. So there’s a lot of profit that can be made before we chew through that. So basically any tax expense that we have going forward, Mark, we’ll pull from that reserve and when the reserve runs out, it runs out, but a 20% tax rate higher expense is just that even if we achieve greatness as a few years before that’s gone.
Mark Miller: And that was – $81.6 million was for the March quarter, is that correct?
Kevin Brewer: We put that up at the end of the last year when we – yes, March quarter. Right.
Mark Miller: Okay. I’m just wondering that maybe I missed the cash from operations.
Kevin Brewer: I just gave the cash number. We went from $140 million to $148 million. I think part of that was from operations.
Mary Puma: Typically it’s a one for one kind of ratio.
Kevin Brewer: So about $7 million to $8 million cash from operations.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Schwab of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Christian Schwab: Great. Good quarter. Did you make a comment of what you’re seeing, Mary, in the nonleading edge side? And what your repetitions are for 2018?
Mary Puma: Well, I didn’t – what I said is that we really haven’t seen a change in the marketplace that overall the demand remained strong and that’s both on the memory side of the business and the mature technology side of the business. And there have been a few – there’s been some movement in and out, which is normal, I think, in any given quarter, but in general, we feel very confident about 2018 and the fact that we’re going to hit our $450 million revenue model, and our customers are telling us they feel confident about the fact that the markets going to remain strong and that we’re in a sustained cycle.
Christian Schwab: Great. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, Christian.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. You have no further questions at this time. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: So we hope to see you in the coming months at the B. Riley conference in Santa Monica and the conference Craig-Hallum conference in Minneapolis, both in May and at the Stifel conference in Boston in June. Thank you for your support.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
21;ACLS;2018-08-03;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company's results for the Second Quarter of 2018. My name is Glenda, and I will be your coordinator for today. Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Glenda. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release, issued earlier today, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website, as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Q2 was another strong quarter for Axcelis, with revenue of $119.3 million, gross margins of 41.1%, operating income of $19.3 million or 16.1% of revenue, and earnings per share of $0.43. These results were well above guidance and consensus estimates. Guidance for the third quarter includes revenue of between $95 million and $100 million, gross margin of approximately 40%, operating income of $8 million to $10 million, and EPS of $0.15 to $0.20. We are still targeting our $450 million business model in 2018, a goal that we set back in January. Two key factors are driving this. First, the highly diverse customer base of the Purion product family, provide some stability to our revenues when one segment like NAND experiences weakness. This quarter we shipped Purion to five new customers, bringing the total number of new Purion customers to 40, since Q1 2016. The second factor is the strong market conditions in the mature process technology segment. This is a segment in which Axcelis has had a large install base and continues to maintain a high market share. Our systems shipment mix in the second quarter was split evenly, with 49% mature foundry/logic and 51% memory. 29% of total shipments were for DRAM and 23% for FLASH. With NAND investment expected to slow in the second half, we anticipate a much higher percentage of mature foundry/logic revenues for the remainder of the year. The mature segment accounted for 67% of our Q2 systems bookings. The geographic mix of our systems shipments were, China, 49%; Korea, 33%; the U.S. and Europe, 13%; and the rest of world, 5%. China continues to be an active geography. During the quarter we shipped our first orders for Purion to new domestic Chinese memory manufacturers. The industry remains in a strong sustained cycle that continues to be fueled by IoT and the mature foundry/logic market, data storage and the 3D NAND market, and data analytics in the DRAM and advanced logic segments. We are currently experiencing near-term softness in the NAND segment, but we are seeing continued spending in DRAM and very active investment in the mature foundry/logic market. With multiple fab construction projects underway, we expect 2019 to be another solid year for equipment CapEx. Customers' fabs across all segments are running at very high utilization rate, which suggests that this will be a short pause. This high utilization combined with the number of Purion systems exiting the warranty phase, is driving an increase in spares and consumable and positively contributing to our CS&I business. CS&I revenue for the second quarter was $45.4 million. I want to emphasize that despite near-term softness in the NAND market, which translates into slightly lower second half revenues compared to the first half, we will continue to make investments required to achieve the $550 million target business model. The bulk of the investments are focused on Purion product development, and supporting resources to address key growth opportunities. We will monitor the spending closely, but it is critical we invest to maintain Purion momentum. This investment will be focused in four key areas. Number one, successfully closing the Purion H evaluation, and gaining share in the advanced foundry/ logic market segment, by leveraging the architectural advantages of the Purion design. Number two, reentering the Japanese market by effectively utilizing our relationship with SCREEN semiconductor and the technological advantages Purion offers Japanese customers. These two market opportunities combined, represent approximately $300 million or about one-third of the ion implant market, that had not been accessible to Axcelis. Number three, continued product development focused on target market segments, such as power devices and image sensors, where Purion provides our customers with significant advantages. This investment in R&D will expand the Purion product line beyond the current Purion power series and Purion VXE and EXE products. And number four, building the required infrastructure to support our growing Chinese business. Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin, to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. I'm very pleased with our Q2 financial performance and overall execution during the quarter. Gross margin in the quarter of 41.1% was significantly above our guidance with operating profit and earnings per share also well above guidance. Margin improvement continues to be an area of focus across the business. And we are targeting initiatives on the things we can control, like strategically investing in CS&I and projects targeted at higher revenue margin expansion, aggressively pursuing cost out through value engineering and lean manufacturing initiatives, leveraging volume across the supply chain using long-term agreements, buying more products from our global partners as Purion matures, and capturing aftermarket sales as Purion's come out of the warranty period. We're also continuing to invest in profit extensions like the Purion power series that provide customers with significant advantages and allow Axcelis to capture value. With regards to operating expenses, I am closely monitoring our spender levels and aligning incremental investment with initiatives that will enable us to achieve our revenue growth objectives. As discussed last quarter, we opened the door to $300 million in potential new revenue for Axcelis, an advanced foundry/logic in the Japanese market. Over the next couple of years, we'll allocate additional capital and resources to setup our applications lab at spring, and increase R&D to support advanced foundry/logic in Purion product extensions. Now I'll review the second quarter of 2018 financial results. Q2 revenue finished at $119.3 million compared to $122.2 million in Q1. Q2 systems sales was $73.9 million compared to $85.5 million in Q1. Q2 CS&I revenues finished at $45.4 million compared to $36.7 million in Q1. Q2 sales for our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 70% of total sales compared to 87% in Q1. There was only one customer at 10% and above. Q2 system bookings were $61.8 million compared to $90.3 million in Q1. While the Q2 book-to-bill ratio of 0.84 versus 1.02 in Q1. Backlog in Q2, including deferred revenue, finished at $74.1 million compared to $89.4 million in Q1. Q2 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $29.7 million or 24.9% of our revenue and in line with guidance compared to $28.7 million or 23.5% in Q1, SG&A in the quarter of $17.2 million, of R&D at $12.6 million. In Q3 we expect SG&A and R&D spending dollars to be flat to Q2, which will be approximately 30% of forecasted revenue. As revenue levels recover, OpEx should more closely align with our $450 million business model at approximately 26% of revenues. Q2 gross margin was 41.1% compared to 38.6% in Q1. Q2 gross margin was positively impacted by higher CS&I revenue, product mix and previously discussed margin improvement initiatives. Q3 gross margin is expected to be approximately 40%. We are now targeting a full year average gross margins of 40%, up 100 basis points from our prior target. Our $450 million model has been updated to reflect this. In addition, our $550 million model was recently increased to 40% to 42% gross margin. Operating profit in Q2 was $19.3 million compared to $18.5 million in Q1. Q2 net income was $14.7 million or $0.43 per share compared to $13.9 million or $0.41 per share in Q1. Regarding Q3 earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.20. Q2 inventory ended at $129.6 million compared to $135 million in Q1. Q2 inventory returns excluding evaluation tools finished at 2.3 compared to 2.4 Q1. Q2 accounts payable were $32.6 million compared to $43.4 million in Q1. Q2 receivables' were $74.4 million compared to $75.6 million in Q1. Q2 cash finished at $154.9 million compared to $148.5 million in Q1. We expect Q3 cash to finish at approximately $160 million. Q2 was a solid quarter for Axcelis. We delivered quarter-over-quarter improvements in gross margin, operating profit, and cash. In 2018, we're focused on driving higher revenues through share gain, improving gross margins through cost out initiatives and product extensions and solid cash generation of use from investments expected to drive future growth. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Mary, for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. It has been a solid first half with strong revenue and earnings growth, accelerated cost out programs, and high value add product extensions have driven gross margins above 40%. Initial entry into two new markets, advanced foundry/logic in Japan have opened $300 million worth of revenue opportunity for Axcelis and we've seen strong growth in CS&I, as more Purion systems exit the warranty period and fab utilizations rise. Based on our large diverse Purion customer base, we continue to target our $450 million business model in 2018. Looking forward, we are now focused on achieving our $550 million target business model in the next one to two years. We have planted the seeds and have a clear line of sight on the actions we must take to accomplish this. Additionally, we have begun efforts to identify both organic and inorganic growth to take Axcelis revenues beyond $550 million. We remain committed and confident that we can continue to deliver the growth and profitability that our shareholders seek. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Craig Ellis: Congratulations on the strength and the results in the quarter. Mary, just following up with the comments on targeting $450 million this year, I think that would imply a rebound in the fourth quarter to about $110 million. So if that's so, can you talk about what would - what would help lead to that recovery, is it debt to mature, foundry business would get even stronger or do envision that there would be a rebound back in the memory side of the business in the fourth quarter?
Mary Puma: Okay, well, Craig, we've not given guidance for Q4, but we are continuing to target our $450 million business model in 2018. So that does provide some insight for you. As I said in the script, market dynamics remain in place to signal the continuation of sustained cycle that we've experienced and we just believe that the overall demand in the mature foundry logic customers are going to - it’s going to remain strong. And then we also believe that memory will in some of the areas that have been a little bit weak will pick up and that will continue - that will start to pick up back in Q4 and then continue on into 2019. So we’ve been sort of firing on all cylinders across the mature foundry logic segment and memory and we expect to get back to that starting in Q4 and then continue with that into 2019.
Craig Ellis: And then just following up on the NAND comment. You mentioned that there were softness in that part of the business, is that a single customer or is that multiple customers not looking for you to name names but just really the breadth of what you're seeing there?
Mary Puma: It's mostly attributable to one customer.
Craig Ellis: And then lastly this question I think is more for Kevin. Kevin we’re at a point where more Purion tools are going to roll off maintenance. And so that sets up the opportunity for an acceleration in services revenue. As we look at the impact of that dynamic to our models relative to the just reported 45 million, what's the potential for there to be sustained growth from that dynamic as we look out over the next two to four quarters or really take longer than that before you get into the sweet spot of all the product placements of the past few years? Thanks very much guys.
Kevin Brewer: So I'll answer that with a couple of points Craig. We are continuing to invest in that part of the business. We’re driving more upgrades which are high-margin events. As you pointed out we talked about more Purion tools and a warranty period which is also adding to the revenue. Q2 was very strong sometimes you know when tools first come out of warranty customers may buy some excess spare so you can tend to see a small spike on tools first come out of warranty. I think what you're trying to get at and I can answer it more directly is the revenue is definitely increasing quarter-over-quarter. And we've always been kind of saying this our 30 million to 35 million range, but I think at this point modeling at 40 million is probably the right place to be.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is open.
Alex Kim: This is Alex Kim filling in for Edwin Mok. Congrats on a great quarter. I just had a few questions to ask. Just wanted to ask about can you provide an update on the tool at the meeting at foundry edge customer?
Mary Puma: So that evaluation is going very well. Things are on track and we have full confidence that we’ll yield the result of the additional market share growth and revenue growth that we expect that will likely happen in 2019.
Alex Kim: So has the tool already started running or producing wafers already?
Mary Puma: Well it’s an evaluation tool, it’s a 12 month evaluation it will shift in the first quarter. So it’s still under evaluation right now, I can’t comment in any more detail other than that.
Alex Kim: And have you seen any changes in pricing at your major competitor?
Kevin Brewer: So Alex let me grab that. So we've factored current pricing assumptions into our margin targets and based on where we see pricing right now and where our cost efforts are which we've been aggressively working on. We’re comfortable at this point to have raised our target model the $450 million model to 40% gross margins which is up 100 basis points. And back at Semicon we had raised the 550 model with a 42% range. So I’m going to say at this point I think the worse is behind us. And what I have been telling everybody as we continue to focus on our cost out and the things we can control. So we’re investing in CS&I, we’re driving a lot of engineering projects and yes, and we’re going to keep focusing on things we can control.
Alex Kim: Have you seen like stable pricing at your competitor or like what kind of changes have you seen?
Kevin Brewer: At the beginning of the year - so we're seeing a lot of pricing pressure, our margins went down, our margins have come back now. So I think it's safe to assume that pricing has at least stabilized because we’re not going backwards or we’re going forward. And again to the cut cost out efforts underway.
Alex Kim: And just wanted to ask on - regarding trailing-edge demand do you see any one or two main segments driving that?
Kevin Brewer: I am, sorry Alex, what driving what?
Alex Kim: Regarding trailing edge demand do you see any one or two main segments driving that?
Kevin Brewer: It's pretty broad across the whole market. In general the automotive and industrial robotics and all those markets continue to be very strong. And so it's - we've seen very high utilization at all of those the customers in that space, power devices and image sensor markets continue to be extremely strong.
Alex Kim: And one more last one, just wanted to ask about the product mix between memory logic you see in 3Q 2018 or 4Q?
Mary Puma: Well we don't usually guide out but we did say that we expect the mature foundry logic, the mature process technology segment to be stronger in the second half because the NAND segment is slightly weaker than it was in the second half - it will be slightly in the second half of the year than it was in the first half of the year. So that will skew a little bit more towards the mature process technology.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is now open.
Christian Schwab: So two quick questions, the first one is what are the puts and takes to get to 550 million in one year versus two years?
Mary Puma: Well, we’ve talked about the fact that opening up the Japanese market through screen semiconductor distribution agreement is one big piece of it that’s about - opens about a $150 million of the TAM. Another $150 million of the TAM comes from successfully completing the evaluation at the advanced foundry logic customer. So those were two big elements that we need to complete. But other things that we're doing are increasing our footprint at existing customers so that could mean getting more recipes run on specific Purion product. It could mean selling additional types of Purion products where we have one Purion product in place so there are number of ways to do that. And then China is another element of that and as we said we shipped our first product into China actually they were two new fabs that we shipped into one was the memory fab and the other was actually in the mature process technology segment. So those are the major pieces that are going to add to the market share and the revenue growth to get to 550. And a lot of that is dependent on how well we execute the, number one but a lot of it is also a function of investment and how quickly our investors - our customers are making those investments. So for example we’ve seen a little bit of slowdown at some of the China fab that could have an impact in terms of whether it’s a 19 or 20 kind of number. But we remain very confident about the fact that we're going to reach that over the next one to two years. And as I said we know exactly what we need to do to get there.
Christian Schwab: As we think about your largest memory spender in the marketplace. Is there any opportunities for market share gains for yourselves or any extra steps that may be needed as that customer moves to the one Y note?
Doug Lawson: In DRAM every time they do, do a shrink it tends to add implants steps in order to get control all those transistors. So that does create opportunity for us much of the time that's in high current space. So that's a positive for Purion H.
Christian Schwab: So you’re hopeful that there may be increased capital intensity for opportunities for yourself when that leading memory customer stabilizes production and begins to accelerators as move to one Y is that fair?
Doug Lawson: Yes that’s definitely fair.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Maybe Mary or Doug first. Yes, given a lot of the noise coming out of China in the local semiconductor market over there, now I think you mentioned that there is a bit of slowdown. With that being said and I guess it just from your perspective in your conversation with those customers. Do you believe this is tariff driven or are they just going to be some of their own timing and I guess yield learning is used and even some capacity digestion on their end?
Mary Puma: I think at this point it’s mostly fab construction based on what we've seen - clearly there are some technology challenges for some of the customers. But I think most of it has to do with just the reality of the building new fab some of them in very remote locations.
Patrick Ho: And Kevin really nice work on the gross margin front, so congrats there. The follow-up question I have on that front is, there is always a lot of moving pieces with gross margin as you mentioned product mix, even the business mix and things of that nature. As you look going forward, as you try and maintain that 40% level what are going to be the biggest influences I guess maintaining that consistent 40% level?
Kevin Brewer: Yes, so we got to stay on track to our gross margin improvement roadmaps that we have out there because those assume various mix changes and when we put together our models, we assume those mix changes and the cost that we need to be at – as well as the pricing based on what we’re currently are right now we believe we’re going to be able see going forward. So it’s the executional cost out Patrick that's really the key to what we’ve got right now and what we’re going to show.
Operator: And next question comes from the line of Mark Miller from Benchmark. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller: Let me add my congratulations especially for the margins. Just wondering you talked about the eval tool at the leading-edge logic fab. Any other color or other evaluations in what you’re doing there?
Doug Lawson: We have a few evaluations out and expect to have a few out for quite a while that's the way we get the new larger customers. So they're all going well and all focused on adding new recipes sometimes at current customers, new customers looking at multiple recipes and options and will use the evaluation process as we penetrate some of the new areas like the Japanese market.
Mark Miller: Are these evals and logic or memory or what the other evals?
Doug Lawson: They’re primarily in memory side of the advanced logic that we discussed.
Mark Miller: You mentioned as the DRAM shrinks its more opportunities for you, what about as NAND goes from 64 to 96 layers and also as logic that goes from 7 and 5 nanometers. Does that open up more process steps and opportunities for Axcelis?
Doug Lawson: So with NAND we’re primarily driven by wafer starts currently. There is a lot of activity looking at material modification, implants that could potentially in the future add some opportunity that was layer dependent. But right now we’re wafer start dependent on NAND. In the advanced logic the 7, 5, 3-nanometer those do tend to add more implants as they get smaller so both for electrical reasons and for material modification
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And this concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Glenda. We hope to see you in the coming months on the road in Beverley or at the Credit Suisse Small Capital on one Conference on August 9th and the City Global Technology Conference on September 6th, both in New York City. Thank you for your support.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
22;ACLS;2018-11-04;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies Call to discuss the company's results for the Third Quarter of 2018. My name is Christy and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Christy. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued earlier today, it is available on our Web site. Playback service will also be available on our Web site as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K Annual Report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Q3 was a solid quarter for Axcelis with revenue of $95.4 million, gross margin of 41.8%, operating profit of $10.7 million or 11.2% of revenue and earnings per share of $0.26. Included in the quarter is a tax benefit of $1.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to 2017 tax reform. Even with this one-time adjustment, these results were in line with or above guidance and consensus estimate. Guidance for the fourth quarter includes revenue of approximately $100 million, gross margin of approximately 40%, operating profit of around $10.5 million and EPS of about $0.20. As a result of slower than expected second half industry spending, we will likely end 2018 with revenue slightly below our $450 million target model, the goal we set back in January. Our achievement of the 40% gross margin goal in that target model has allowed us to continue to invest in Purion product growth while maintaining strong earnings. There are three key factors driving this. First, a highly diverse customer base of the Purion product family provides stability to our revenues when one segment like NAND experiences weakness. This quarter we shipped Purion to five new fabs bringing the total number of new Purion customers and new fabs to 45 since Q1 of 2016. Our Purion install base has tripled during this timeframe. The second factor is continuing strong market conditions in the mature process technology segment. This is a segment in which Axcelis has a large install base and continues to maintain a high market share. The third factor is our strong CS&I business driven by the growing number of Purion systems exiting the warranty period, higher utilization rates in mature process technology fabs, and ongoing investment in upgrades and other products and services for our large legacy install base. Our system shipment mix in the third quarter was heavily weighted toward mature foundry/logic, which accounted for 72% of revenues. Memory accounted for the remaining 28% of revenues with 11% DRAM and 17% Flash. We expect similar market conditions in the fourth quarter, which will drive revenues to remain heavily weighted toward the mature foundry/logic segment. This segment also represented 71% of total bookings in Q3. The geographic mix of our system shipments were China 33%, Korea 32%, the U.S. and Europe 16% and the Rest of World 19%. This is a more diverse geographical mix than in past quarters. While we are currently experiencing a slowdown in memory spending, we believe the industry remains in a healthy long-term cycle that is fueled by IoT in the mature foundry/logic market, data storage in the 3D NAND market, and data analytics in the DRAM and advanced logic segments. We are continuing to invest in areas key to achieving the $550 million target business model. During today's call, I would like to highlight our efforts in Japan, which have accelerated over the past quarter. The Japanese market represents approximately $150 million to $200 million of greenfield opportunity for Axcelis. Our distribution and support partner, SCREEN Semiconductor Solutions, has done an excellent job introducing Axcelis to the Japanese customer base and we have received a very warm reception. Japanese customers like the technology capabilities of the Purion product family and have been actively running demos at our Beverly Advanced Technology Center. As planned, to support customer demos and training requirements, we shipped a Purion H high current implanter to SCREEN's advanced technology center in Hikone, Japan during the third quarter. We expect to begin utilizing this system for local customer activity in the first quarter of 2019. In December, we will be participating at SEMICON Japan in the SCREEN booth and have planned multiple joint customer meetings. While SCREEN is our partner for Purion systems, our growing presence in Japan has also increased the activity for our legacy systems and opened opportunity for increased CS&I revenue from our existing install base. During the quarter, we also hired John Kulungian as our new VP of Quality. John is focused on enhancing the customer experience by driving quality in both the factory and the field. In addition to improving customer satisfaction, we believe that these quality initiatives will contribute to our efficiency and ultimately result in additional cost out. Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. We delivered solid Q3 financial results with gross margin, operating profit, EPS all above guidance and consensus estimates. Strong gross margin performance at 41.8% was driven by continued execution of our gross margin improvement roadmaps as well as a favorable mix of systems and CS&I. Margin improvement continues to be an area of focus across the business. As I discussed last quarter, we are targeting initiatives on the things we can control like strategically investing in CS&I projects targeted at margin expansion, pursuing cost out through value engineering and lean manufacturing initiatives, leveraging higher volumes across the supply chain and purchasing more material from our global suppliers. With regards to operating expenses, we continue to align incremental spending with initiatives expected to drive margin expansion and revenue growth. I'll review the third quarter financial results. Q3 revenue finished at $95.4 million compared to $119.3 million in Q2. Q3 system sales were $56.4 million compared to $73.9 million in Q2. Q3 CS&I revenue finished at $39 million compared to $45.4 million in Q2. Q3 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 80% of our total sales compared to 70% in Q2 with three customers at 10% or above. Q3 system bookings were $62.8 million compared to $61.8 million in Q2 with a Q3 book-to-bill ratio of 1.08 versus 0.84 in Q2. Backlog in Q3, including deferred revenue, finished at $81.3 million compared to $74.1 million in Q2. Q3 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $29.2 million or 30.7% of revenue. This was in line with our guidance and compares to $29.7 million or 24.9% in Q2. SG&A in the quarter was $16.4 million with R&D at $12.8 million. In Q4, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately 30% of revenue or flat to Q2. Q3 gross margin was 41.8% compared to 41.1% in Q2. Q3 gross margin was positively impacted by previously discussed margin improvement initiatives and mix. Q4 gross margin is expected to be approximately 40% with full-year gross margins also expected to be approximately 40%. Operating profit in Q3 was $10.7 million compared to $19.3 million in Q2. We are guiding Q4 operating profit of approximately $10.5 million. Q3 net income was $8.8 million or $0.26 per share compared to $14.7 million or $0.43 per share in Q2. Included in the quarter is a tax benefit of $1.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to the 2017 tax reform. We are guiding Q4 earnings per share of approximately $0.20. Q3 inventory ended at $124 million compared to $129.6 million in Q2. Q3 inventory turns, excluding evaluation tools, finished at 1.9 compared to 2.3 in Q2. Q3 accounts payable were $27.9 million compared to $32.6 million in Q2. Q3 receivables were $85 million compared to $74.4 million in Q2 due to the timing of shipments. Q3 cash finished at $155.6 million compared to $154.9 million in Q2. We remain focused on driving higher revenues while improving gross margin through cost productivity and project extensions. Solid cash generation is a long list of non-critical investments expected to drive future revenue growth. So, I will now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. Our broad and diverse customer base has allowed Axcelis to perform significantly better during this pause than in the past. Strength in both Purion and legacy tools coupled with product offerings focused on power devices and image sensors have provided strength during this memory slowdown. Our CF&I business has also been performing well consistently delivering revenues in the $40 million range as greater numbers of Purion systems exit the warranty period and fab utilization remains high. We are now focused on achieving our $550 million target business model in the next couple of years. By adding key wins in Japan and China to the expanding Purion footprint at existing customers, we will have penetrated the accounts required to achieve this goal. With $550 million in revenue in our line of sight, we have begun efforts to identify both organic and inorganic growth to take revenues beyond this target business model. The Axcelis team has worked very hard to bring us to this point. We want to thank all of our employees for their efforts. We are excited about the success this has brought Axcelis and the financial returns this will deliver to shareholders as market dynamics strengthen. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Your line is open.
Peter Peng: Hi. This is actually Peter Peng calling for Craig Ellis and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Just wanted to touch on China. Some of your larger cap peers says that China is relatively on track. Just based on your discussions, what are you seeing for 2019?
Mary Puma: Yes. I would say in general most of the projects are on track. We're seeing customers who have been building fabs actually starting to populate now with some tools and that's in some of the start-up fabs, some of the memory start-ups in particular. Some of the more established Chinese customers are actually continuing, especially if they're in the mature process technology area or mature foundry/logic area, to buy actually quite heavily. So, we think that things at this point are on track.
Peter Peng: Great. And on your memory, one of your large memory customers, it seems like from their 4Q CapEx, it seems like there is a huge surge. When would you see that kind of benefiting you, is this perhaps a first half or a second half kind of phenomenon?
Mary Puma: It will probably be the first half of 2019 I would suspect at this point in time. Again, we are in a slight pause right now from some of our memory customers, but we expect things to pick up in 2019.
Peter Peng: One more question. Just on the -- your Taiwan potential customer. Do you see that as a 2019 benefit or is this going to be more 2020 kind of case?
Mary Puma: I think it will start in 2019. It's something though that will ramp over time. So while it starts in 2019, it's likely to be higher volume in 2020.
Peter Peng: Great. That's all I have. Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks, Peter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open.
Christian Schwab: Yes. Good afternoon. Good execution in a tough environment. When we look at memory in 2019, would you expect that to be more like second half weighted as far as a recovery in shipments for you right now, is that would you'd be thinking?
Mary Puma: I mean our visibility into 2019 isn't great. But based on what we know today, I think that that's probably a pretty good assumption.
Christian Schwab: And then how much longer do you believe or have confidence that non-leading edge equipment spending can remain robust?
Doug Lawson: Hey, Christian, it's Doug. It appears like it's going to continue for a while. There's quite a bit of spending there and quite a number of different applications. So, we've seen a lot of high energy activity related to image sensors and embedded memory and so forth and then a lot of productivity improvements as a result of products like the Purion H in those areas. And in the mature foundry, productivity is the key. These technologies are relatively -- they're mature by definition of the name and the yields tend to be fairly high so productivity is how they make their money.
Christian Schwab: Right. And then, lastly, as far as taking a look at different ways to get above $550 million at some point. Are you looking -- can you give us any type of idea of what you think would be as far as product or support or where is the leverage in the Axcelis model to bring in something else or acquire something else. I'm kind of trying to figure out what you -- obviously, I don't want you to tell me what you're going to buy. But I'm confused about where you think that there could be leverage in scale and synergies?
Doug Lawson: Yes. Well, I think we're doing that evaluation right now, Christian. And the things -- we have good front-end channels; we know that market very well. We are very good on the physics side of things and so we have very strong manufacturing capabilities of very complex equipment. So, those are attributes that we can work off of. But we're in the middle of that evaluation and as we know more, we'll let you know.
Christian Schwab: Okay. Sounds fair. Thank you. No other questions.
Doug Lawson: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe first for either Mary or Doug. With your initiative in Japan with SCREEN, the region is a very good mix for both memory as well as the mature technology nodes. I guess in the very early stages that you are right now, are you seeing an interest from one or the other in Japan right now or in time do you believe it's going to be a relatively balanced mix?
Mary Puma: I think right now we're seeing interest from a broad customer base so it would be mix of both memory and the mature foundry/logic or mature process technologies segments. And so I think over time we would expect the mix that we have today, which is relatively split to probably hold in Japan as well.
Patrick Ho: Great, that's helpful. And maybe, Doug, as a follow-up to Christian's or one of the questions earlier about the sustainability of the mature technology nodes. You've mentioned productivity, is that the biggest driver because we are seeing some capacity additions, especially in the CMOS image sensor or a retrofit of fabs, is the productivity the biggest driver for the sustainability or are there potentially new fab projects and capacity expansion plans that will drive volume?
Doug Lawson: There's definitely new projects. Many of these companies are doing expansions to existing fabs and in some cases, there is actually new fabs being built. The image sensor and power device market we classify within that group and both of those require more than just productivity. The image sensors are very dependent on very high quality, high energy systems for high yields in these complex image sensors. And the power device market is moving more and more toward silicon carbide for their high-voltage, high-speed switching applications and the Purion high temperature capabilities become critical for that. In general though in a mature fab that's running at high volumes with a big product mix, productivity is a very big deal to them.
Patrick Ho: Great. And final question maybe for Kevin in terms of the gross margin profile, which has held very, very well despite some of the volatility we're seeing near term. You've talked a lot about the efforts you've done on the system side of the business with the Purion platform and the leveraging of commonality. Can you give a little bit of color of efforts you're taking on the CS&I business? And what I'm looking for there is the install base gets larger, I'm sure it's becoming I guess a strange deal with more and more customers. How do you keep that business margin profiles at its high levels? Are their efforts you're taking within that business that can even improve it down the road?
Kevin Brewer: Okay. It's a good question, Patrick. So, we have almost for the last two years now been investing more in that side of the business. We put a fairly big team of engineers into the group to focus on upgrades in particular. And upgrades -- it's one of those markets where you create your own market, the upgrade is not there until we come out with it and typically we are going after things that are productivity improvement or some type of yield improvement. So, we have been driving more upgrades into that side of the business. We are also, as you point out, we're getting more volume that's coming out just with some additional tools out there and volume always helps cost. So, we are getting a little bit of pickup from the volume. So between the upgrades we're working on and the additional volume, we're trying to move those margins even higher because that is, as you pointed out and as we always say, is a very accretive part of the business, want to make sure it stays away. So, we are definitely focused there and we have a team of engineers working on that side of the business.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from David Duley of Steelhead Securities. Your line is open.
David Duley: Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple. What length of warranty period do you guys have on the Purion tools and you mentioned that the Purion install base tripled I think over the last couple of years. Could you give us a number for the install base?
Kevin Brewer: I mean if we did say that, I'm not sure when we did or we did triple.
Mary Puma: We didn't give any numbers and we are not going to give any numbers, Dave.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. But the typical warranty period, Dave, is 12 months on a Purion tool which is standard for other products as well.
David Duley: Okay. And then the opportunity once they come off warranty? Clearly 2017 was a good revenue year versus '16, so you should have a nice bump up in the service and support revenue from that year. I'm kind of trying to figure out what the growth rate might be here or the trajectory might be for the service business going forward with all of those tools rolling off warranty?
Kevin Brewer: Well, I mean what we've been kind of telling people right now is that modeling at $40 million is probably the right run rate and as we move forward towards our $550 million model that would come up a little bit from there.
David Duley: Okay. And then versus -- I think last quarter you were still hopeful that you might be able to achieve $450 million in revenue this quarter. I think you were just a bit light on that, maybe $10 million or so. I was curious as to what area that you didn't achieve your goals in.
Mary Puma: We had a few tools move around, but as you know, it doesn't take very many tools to have a miss for us. But it was mainly in the memory area that we had some movement.
David Duley: Was that in NAND or in DRAM?
Mary Puma: It was in NAND.
David Duley: Okay. And then final thing from me. Doug, could you give us an idea? I think we can do the straight numbers with your revenue now guided to Q4, but we don't have the denominator and how big do you think the implant market was in 2018?
Doug Lawson: Dave, we estimate the market to be a billion plus or minus about 10% pretty much every year between the new applications that come on and the productivity improvements that reduce it, it's pretty much over the last 10 years averaged right around there. So, we don't try to get the pencil any sharper than that.
David Duley: Okay. Thanks.
Doug Lawson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Miller with Benchmark. Your line is open.
Mark Miller: Just wondering how many fabs you mentioned you shipped the tool in Japan. How many evaluations do you have tools -- fabs do you have tools in?
Mary Puma: We have two evaluations currently out in the field. One in a memory customer and one at a leading edge logic foundry.
Mark Miller: Next year could you going to give us a little insight in terms of what would be your leading growth areas, would it be Japan, of course, you're not doing anything this year; but Japan, China, or mature foundry in terms of year-over-year improvements?
Mary Puma: Well, we've talked about how we're focused on Japan right now. We're making a very significant investment there and it's a very large market, about $150 million to $200 million. So, that's obviously an area where we expect to have some growth. We will likely have some evaluation units in 2019, but significant revenue won't likely come until 2020. We've all talked about China and how it's a growing geography. So we would expect to continue to see growth there. We've made commentary during the course of this year how we've actually invested in the infrastructure in China to support that growth. So, again we're anticipating that it will take -- we'll start to see more in 2019. And then there's also the memory area for us, we expect to see additional growth in that area as well.
Mark Miller: Would that growth be coming from DRAM because Western Digital, I think Micron, and also maybe Samsung have been talking about scaling back because of the NAND oversupply.
Doug Lawson: They certainly have discussed that. We don't expect that that is going to be something that's going to last throughout the entire year next year. So as far as your question relative to 2019, we would expect that there will be DRAM and NAND activity as they continue to balance their fabs and add capacity as demand requires it.
Mark Miller: And finally, could you provide cash from operations for September, please?
Kevin Brewer: $1.9 million and $17.2 million year-to-date.
Mark Miller: And CapEx, I'm sorry, you have CapEx too?
Kevin Brewer: I don't have that at my fingertips, maybe uncertain. Somewhere around $2 million, Mark, probably the right number for the quarter.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's Q&A portion of the call. I would now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Christy. We hope to see you in the coming months on the road in Beverly or at the Benchmark Discovery Conference on November 29 in Chicago. And we will also be at the New York City Summit on December 11 and the Needham Conference on January 15, both in New York City. Thank you for your support.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[0.009121485105786364, 0.07715537373982384];0.07715537373982384;0.009121485105786364;0
23;ACLS;2019-02-07;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies Call to discuss the Company's results for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year of 2018. My name is Brian, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and Chief Executive Officer of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Brian. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website, as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K Annual Report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 2018 was a successful year for Axcelis. One year-ago at our year-end earnings call, we set a revenue objective of $450 million and we came very close with full-year 2018 revenues of $442.6 million, only a couple of tools short, despite the significant slowdown in memory spending for the entire second half of the year. We accomplished this as a result of hard work over the last few years and the successful execution of a few critical initiatives. First, we expanded the Purion installed base to a large and diverse group of customers. Second, we focused on key market segments in the mature process technology area such as image sensors, power devices, and mature foundry/logic. And finally, we developed Purion product extensions specifically for these segments and became key partners with these customers. As a result, when memory slowed, Axcelis kept growing. All of our financial metrics improved in 2018, revenue increased by nearly 8%, systems revenue increased by approximately 7%, market share grew to 29%, CS&I revenue increased by nearly 10%, gross margin exceeded 40%, and cash increased by over 30% to nearly $185 million. All this while the memory market was experiencing a deep slowdown, which is reflected in the fourth quarter in our revenue mix by segment with a split of 68% mature foundry/logic and 32% memory. For the full-year the mix was 54% mature foundry/logic and 46% memory, highlighting the tale of the two halves. Now let me summarize a few of our fourth quarter 2018 financial results and provide Q1 guidance. Revenues for the quarter were $105.7 million with earnings per share of $0.25. Results for the quarter were above guidance and consensus estimates. 2018 revenues were $442.6 million with earnings per share of $1.35. The geographic mix of our systems shipments for the fourth quarter were Korea 24%, China 22%, Taiwan 19%, the U.S. and Europe 22%, Japan 10%, and the rest of the world 3%. Turning to guidance for the first quarter, we are forecasting revenues of between $90 million and $95 million. We expect gross margins of approximately 41% operating income of $6 million to $7 million and EPS of $0.10 to $0.13. With the memory slowdown continuing as we enter the New Year, our 2019 results will depend largely on when memory spending picks back up. Based on what we know today and without providing full-year guidance. Our 2019 revenues could be flat to down 5% to 10%. Gross margins will continue to improve year-over-year, but will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Highly profitable market share leadership in ion implantation remains our primary objective. So we will maintain standing levels in R&D and SG&A through this downturn. R&D will be focused on new Purion products and extensions. We have been very successful with our market segment approach to product development and sales. In 2019, we will continue to develop Purion product extensions focused on the image sensor market for advanced image sensor products and on the power device market in silicon carbide as well as silicon. Additionally, we will be investing in Purion H product extension, specifically targeting the productivity needs of the mature process technology market and the advanced technology requirements of leading-edge logic customers. SG&A investment will be focused on development of infrastructure to support the Japanese market, continued expansion of the Chinese market and penetration of the advanced foundry/logic segment. Our three 2019 growth objectives include; number one, growing our Purion footprint within our existing customer base; number two, penetrating new markets with Purion, specifically the advanced foundry/logic segment and the Japanese market. Each of these markets represents approximately $150 million of the $1 billion ion implant [TAM]; and number three, introducing Purion product extensions to drive growth in the next upturn. Despite this current slowdown in memory, the fundamentals of the data-centric connected world have not changed. The cycle continues to be driven by IoT in the mature foundry/logic market, data storage in the 3D NAND market and data analytics and AI in the DRAM and advanced logic segment. As 5G proliferates, we expect another boost to this cycle across all segments. Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. Axcelis delivered solid fourth quarter results hitting Company guidance and consensus estimates across the Board. Full-year 2018 financial results also finished strong, but revenue and gross margin at our highest levels in 12 years. Cash generated from operations in 2018 was $49.9 million which drove our year-end cash balance to $184.9 million. Margin improvement continues to be an area of focus across the business in 2018 as we targeted improvement initiatives on the things we could control. In 2019, we expect to realize additional product cost out through value engineering and lean, supply chain optimization, and strategic investments in CS&I project. With regards to operating expenses, we are aligning incremental spending with initiatives are expected to drive customer satisfaction, margin expansion, and growth opportunities that support our $550 million business model and beyond. Based on the Company’s strong financial performance and solid cash position, we announced on January 14 that Axcelis Board had authorized a one-year $35 million share repurchase program. We believe this program which is meaningful in size and we executed all impacting our strategic growth initiatives. Now turning to our fourth quarter financial results. Q4 revenue finished at $105.7 million compared to $95.4 million in Q3. Q4 system sales were $64.6 million compared to $56.4 million in Q3. Q4 CS&I revenue finished at $41.1 million compared to $39 million in Q3. Full-year 2018 revenue was $442.6 million up approximately 8% compared to $410.6 million in 2017. Systems revenue for the year was $280.4 million up approximately 7% compared to $262.7 million in 2017. CS&I revenue was $162.2 million compared to $147.9 million in 2017, up approximately 10%. Q4 sales draw top 10 customers accounted for approximately 83% of our total sales compared to 80% in Q3, the five customers at 10% or above. Q4 system bookings were $42.1 million compared to $62.8 million in Q3, with a Q4 book-to-bill ratio, 0.67 versus 1.08 in Q3. Backlog in Q4, including deferred revenue, finished at $63.1 million compared to $81.3 million in Q3. Q4 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $32 million or 30.3% of revenue and in line with guidance, compared to $29.2 million or 30.7% in Q3. SG&A in the quarter was $17.8 million with R&D at $14.2 million. In Q1, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately $33 million to support growth initiatives and certain expenses that occur each year and our first quarter. Q4 gross margin was 41.2% compared to 41.8% in Q3. Full-year gross margin was 40.6% compared to 36.6% in 2017. Gross margin improvement initiatives, product extensions and mix favorably impact the full-year margins, which finished at our highest level in five years. Regarding Q1 gross margin of approximately 41%, and expect full-year 2019 gross margin be in the 40% to 41% range. Operating profit in Q4 was $11.5 million compared to $10.7 million in Q3. Full-year 2018 operating profit was $60 million, up 25% compared to $47.8 million in 2017. Regarding Q1 operating profit were approximately $6 million to $7 million. Q4 net income was $8.5 million or $0.25 per share compared to $8.8 million or $0.26 per share in Q3. Full-year 2018 net income was $45.9 million compared to a net income of $127 million at 2017, which was fairly impacted by a reversal of the valuation allowance, regarding Q1 earnings per share of $0.10 to $0.13. Q4 inventory ended at $129 million compared to $124 million in Q3. Q4 inventory turns, excluding evaluation tools finished at 2.1 compared to 1.9 in Q3. Q4 accounts payable were $36 million compared to $27.9 million in Q3. Q4 receivables were $78.7 million compared to $85 million in Q3. Q4 cash finished at $184.9 million compared to $155.6 million in Q3. In a quarter, we generated $32.6 million of cash from operations. Full-year cash from operations was $49.9 million. Year end 2018 cash of $184.9 million was up $44 million compared to $140.9 million in 2017. We realized strong financial performance in 2018, driven by growth and system sales and CS&I. In 2019, we plan to execute initiatives that will drive customer satisfaction, margin expansion and business growth. Plan to closely monitor all incremental spending to maintain cost control or invest in initiatives that are critical to achieving our $550 million business model. Our updated model, which now reflects gross margin of 42% to 43%, operating profit of 17% to 18% and free cash flow greater than 15% can be found on a Company website. I will now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. Our customers have a choice in implant and as the number show, they are choosing Axcelis. They choose Axcelis for Purion platform technology for solutions tailored to their needs in the form of Purion product extensions and for the innovation benefit they gain from a more competitive ion implant market. In 2018, Axcelis approved through our financial performance that we are much more than a memory company. I am confident that with the continued focus on customer needs, the technology development to support those needs and the dedication of our employees, Axcelis will continue to grow and will achieve market share leadership in ion implantation. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Brian?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Craig Ellis: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on all the financial accomplishments from 2018. Mary, I wanted to start just with a follow-up on your point on 2019s objectives and maybe tie that into the potential for revenues in 2019 to be down in the 5% to 10% range. Can you just help us with some of the milestones associated with each of the three objectives and in the way that plays into the potential revenues that Axcelis could realize on a longer-term basis as we look at 2019?
Mary Puma: Okay. Well, first let me clarify. We said that we could be flat to down 5% to 10%. So right now really what's driving, I'll call it directional information on where our revenues could go, has to do with where we are in the cycle. And we said the long-term cycle remains intact, but the slowdown that we're experiencing, which is mainly driven by memory, is really what potentially will have an impact on our revenues this year. So like our peers and others in the industry, we expect memory spending to begin picking back up likely sometime in the second half of the year, maybe starting with DRAM and then spreading to 3D NAND. So in terms of the objectives that we have for the year, what's going on right now really doesn't change any of the initiatives that we have or the milestones that we have. So we talked to three – objectives we talked about our growth within – growing our Purion footprint within our existing customer base. So really what's going on right now in the market doesn't have any impact on that, potentially it's just a timing issue with the memory customers. We're going to continue to focus on penetrating Japan and the advanced foundry/logic market. And again, all of those initiatives will continue as planned. And then finally, we're going to continue developing product extensions for some of the specific market segment where we feel like there's a good opportunity to win new business and expand our business. So again, we've talked about in the past, power devices, CMOS image sensors and advanced logic and memory. So again, none of those things other than potentially timing based on, in some of those memory customers will have an impact on what we're doing in 2019.
Douglas Lawson: Hey, Craig. This is Doug. Let me just add a little bit more color on the products. One of the things that we're really focusing on this year is bringing product extensions to the high current market with Purion H. There’s a very different need in high current for the mature markets compared to the advanced markets. And so, as you know, we've worked very closely with image sensor companies and power device companies to tailor the Purion product family to those markets. And now we're looking at doing the same thing with the high current markets, especially as we looked at productivity for mature, which has been a strong point for us.
Craig Ellis: That's very helpful. My next question is on gross margin. Kevin, really strong gross margins in the quarter and the outlook, you've been clear for 18 months or so that there are cost down initiatives that the company is executing. So as we look at gross margins, not only in the near-term, but with the target model increasing, how much of what we're seeing is really the fruits of those cost down initiatives versus other things like mix and the product customization benefits that you'd be getting versus any change in the competitive landscape?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So as you highlight, I continue to say that we've been driving cost out of the projects, the value engineering, the supply chain optimization, we put a lot of work in that. The product extensions which brings some premium pricing along as well. So we still have a large number of opportunities to drive for the cost out of the products. Purion as it's matured over the last several years, we’ve been able to move more parts into our low cost suppliers or we're continuing to look at that at this point in time. And going forward, as Doug just kind of mentioned and Mary did as well, we're investing in these products right now for more product extensions, which is further going to help the gross margins. And if I look at the target model, we've up that, I think the last model we had out there had us at 40% to 42% at $550 million. We've up at the 42% to 43%. It's a combination of the cost out, the product extensions and the mix is more of a thing quarter-to-quarter that we've talked about depending on mix of service to system is or the mix within the Purion products. But in the updated investor presentation, the slide that shows our relative standard margins of the three Purion products. You'll see as we get all to that $550 million model. That's the good news is the H, more closely aligns with high energy on the standard margins, which is good because that's a large opportunity for us still. So we're growing in that area and the margins are also accelerating that area.
Craig Ellis: That's helpful. And last one for me before I get back in the queue. The share buyback announcement earlier this year, material development for the Company, material in size, can you just help us understand how you would approach utilizing that buyback. One, have you started to do anything? And two, is that something that could be used on a more readable basis or matrix basis? Just help us with a framework per use.
Kevin Brewer: Yes, so we're not using a 10b5-1 program. So our plan is to be opportunistic when we purchase these shares. I want to make sure that we're utilizing the company cash in a manner that's a good investment for both the Company and the shareholders.
Craig Ellis: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from line Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Well, thank you very much and congratulations also. Mary, maybe first off in terms of the mature technology node, opportunities and the strength you saw in the December quarter. You talked in your prepared remarks about CMOS image sensors – and power semiconductors. Where there any other types of devices where you saw straight and whether that mix changes in terms of the devices in Q1?
Mary Puma: Okay, So, I'll have Doug respond to that
Douglas Lawson: Hey, Patrick. So those two product lines continue to be strong. One thing that we've started to focus on is the silicon side of power device. Last year there was a lot of activity in silicon carbide. What we found as we've really done this market segment approach is we get very, very close with the customers and oftentimes with their customers. And so we're able to understand their roadmaps in more detail and then go back and create extensions that can focus in on that area. So one of the places that that we're very focused on right now is, in the mature foundries where product mix and productivity are a big deal, and high current typically is a bottleneck for them. Purion H has done well there. But we see some opportunities in that market to really focus there. And then in the advanced logic, we've had an evaluation going on, so we've gotten much closer to the process needs and requirements there. And so now we're really looking at how to tailor Purion H even more for some of those more advanced notes. So that's the activity there.
Patrick Ho: Great, that’s helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question, you talked about the extensions and how in the past productivity improvements are a key variable in driving sales for the extensions. Is that still the only variable that drives these extinctions? Are you seeing other factors, I guess drive your – I guess needs to create more of these extensions that you described on the call?
Douglas Lawson: It varies by market segment. So for example, in image sensors, metals contamination and infrared and deep red implants, they require a much higher energy. So that's an area that's – that affects yield effects, the device performance. In power device market, it's a thermal control. It's a silicon carbide substrates and now as we move into silicon. There's different device, our requirements there. So it's not just productivity. Oftentimes it very much gets back to device performance and yield issues.
Patrick Ho: Great, and final question from me for Kevin. Obviously, the timing of a memory recovery is still very uncertain and that's a big swing factor for the industry as a whole. From a supply chain management and the optimization you talked about on the call. How are you managing that in your inventory levels given that uncertainty and I guess helping to keep your gross margins in that 40% to 41% range?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So what we do when things start to slowdown typically that we have a lot of inventory that's very short lead time. So it's really the longer lead time inventory we have to manage through. So we'd have planning bill of materials that we continue to drive and based on what we're hearing from the sales team and where we think the second half is going to be the long lead stuff, we will continue to drive that. But again, the short lead, you can easily turn that off. And we've also got a lot of our suppliers setup on a pull right now, so it's easier to hold the material back when you don't need it and then have it though when we get ready to turn back on. But we're keeping a close eye on things because we got to make sure that we certainly don't want to miss a ramp up. So we're, like I said, we're closely monitoring that Patrick.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Brewer: Okay. Thanks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of David Duley with Steelhead Securities. Your line is now open.
David Duley: Yes. I had – just a couple of clarification questions. There was a big jump in deferred revenue in the quarter. I think from $14 million to $19 million. Could you explain what that was?
Kevin Brewer: A lot of it's on the timing of the shipments.
Mary Puma: Yes. There was a lot that went up in December, right at the end this year.
Kevin Brewer: Right.
David Duley: Okay. And then recently when you reported around $95 million, if you had higher earnings levels then I think you're forecasting the operating income forecasting for the current level. And I'm just wondering what the key reasons are for that. I think it's an operating expenses. Maybe you could just talk about the incremental investment and operating expenses that you're making?
Kevin Brewer: Well, yes, I mean it is the operating expenses and the call, I think we talked about we're going to continue to invest for this cycle, product extensions that we have lined up, we're going to invest in because those are all things we need to get us to the 550 model. So if we pull back right now on a spending, we're going to really jeopardize was 550 model and beyond. So the margins have been brought up, offset some of that. But there is higher spending probably then, I'm not sure what model are you looking at, but certainly it's probably higher than what you're saying.
David Duley: Well, I was just comparing it. I think to the third quarter of 2018 when you did $95 million and operating income was $10.7 million and now you're guiding it to a lower number.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. And then also and I mean if you want is a little bit heavier, but there is one-time expenses that we get in Q1 that we don't see in other quarters. So that doesn't help the Q1 numbers.
David Duley: Okay. The key Dave is really going back to that investment. This is – we're somewhere in the bottom of this cycle and as it turns around we want to make sure we've got the product sets. If you look on the updated revenue chart by year, you can see that we've invested pretty heavily in new product introductions. There are need to the down cycles and that's the key to driving success in the up cycle.
Mary Puma: And it's not just the R&D it's also in the infrastructure to support growth. So we've been talking about our relationship with SCREEN and how that's going to drive our growth in Japan. We've shipped Purion H there that's going to be coming online, becoming available for demo and training in Q1. So their expenses like that where we're just going to continue to make the investment because it's the right thing to do.
Kevin Brewer: …as well as additional evals.
Mary Puma: Yes. Additionally evals we've got an additional infrastructure in China and then also some to support the leading edge foundry/logic. So those are all the right things to do to prepare us for the 550 model and beyond.
David Duley: Okay. Help us understand what's embedded in your expectations for the year from the two new markets, either Japan or the high end foundry/logic market?
Mary Puma: At this point in time, we've talked about this a lot. Those are two markets that are very difficult to penetrate. We are working very hard to – well we have an evaluation unit and at an advanced a foundry customer and that's going well. And so that will just continue to expand over time. Again, it just takes time to get additional follow-on orders from that. And in Japan, I would hope that we would place some of our initial units, whether their evaluation or actual outright sales into Japan in 2019. But again, we're not going to see any significant volume coming from either of those segments this year. It's likely to start next year.
David Duley: Okay. And then, Kevin what do you expect the tax rate to be during 2019?
Kevin Brewer: We always model the 21%. We've obviously been doing a little bit better than that because there's R&D tax credits and this year it’ll allow us to fund whole tax and things, but I would just use 21%, Dave.
David Duley: Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Douglas Lawson: Thanks Dave.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Christian Schwab with Hallum Capital Group. Your line is now open.
Christian Schwab: Hey. Good morning, guys. I apologize in advance, but I jumped on a little bit late. So on 2018, you expect your revenue year-over-year to be flat to down 5% to 10%, correct?
Mary Puma: Yes.
Christian Schwab: Fabulous. Can you – what were the one, two to three reasons that you gave for your dramatic outperformance of what wafer front-end equipment spending in aggregate will do this year being down mid-to-high teens?
Mary Puma: What do you think is going to continue to drive our growth this year? Is that what you're asking?
Christian Schwab: Yes. Well, I guess my question is why are you outperforming CapEx spending in general, which is expected by most to be down mid-to-high teens year-over-year and you could do as well as flat? So I'm looking for the two or three reasons why?
Mary Puma: Okay. So first, it does have to do with market dynamics. And we talked about – we've been talking about how we're more than just a memory company. We have a very strong customer base and revenue base in the mature process technology area and that's likely going to have a much higher percentage – represent a much higher percentage of our revenues in 2019 and that segment remains strong. We've also had good Purion market penetration. So we've got a diverse customer base. And we just talked about how we're going to continue to focus on increasing our presence on Purion footprint. So we talked about Japan and advanced logic. There's some new memory applications that we're going after and there’s some specialty applications, and again, we've talked about power devices and image sensors. And so we're working all of those things and we're continuing to gain market share despite the fact that the market, the actual CapEx spending is likely to be down this year. And then the final thing, Doug talked about this a few minutes ago, the new product extensions, we're going to continue to invest in that. And some of those new products and upgrades and things that are going to enhance our ability to meet some of these new applications are going to start to come out in 2019 and we expect those to start to get traction at the end of the year. So this year, again, I said this earlier, but it's really – the flat to minus 5% to 10% of revenues is really being driven by the memory downturn. And we expect things like our peers do to potentially pick backup sometime in the second half of the year and that will drive where our revenues end up in 2019 verses 2018.
Christian Schwab: Okay. So not to put words in your mouth so let me restate what you went through there. So you would say that mature node spending remains robust in 2019 versus 2018. You would continue to expect to gain market share throughout 2019 versus 2018, and if memory comes back in the second half of the year it will be closer to flat. If it doesn’t, it will be closer to down 10. Is that fair?
Mary Puma: Again, I don't know. We're not giving guidance for the year in terms of exactly where we'll end up for the year. But what we are saying is the memory recovery and timing of the – the timing and strength of the memory recovery will impact our 2019 revenues.
Christian Schwab: Okay, great. Thanks. No other questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mark Miller with Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller: Thank you for the question. So pursuing that recent line further up with smartphone production expected to be down this year, what gives you confidence that memory will be bouncing back in the second half of the year?
Douglas Lawson: Well, I think the exact timing of when memory bounces back Mark, is still up for debate by everybody in the universe. But memory spending isn't just being driven by the smartphone, the data center and analytics and so forth are very big drivers. So we feel like most everyone that we're in a fairly typical memory cycle. In the middle of a stronger wave, which is more or less data-centric wave and as the supply and demand come back into line, the memory will kick back in. We feel that DRAM probably kicked in a little sooner than 3D NAND at least for implant and then 3D NAND will kick back in again as the supply and demand come back in line. So the exact timing, we're not trying to guess exact. We certainly would prefer it to happen sooner than later.
Mark Miller: Okay. Just from your guidance for the current quarter for the year in terms of the topline. What's going to be driving the big? It looks like a very significant increase [indiscernible] in your revenues. Is it going to be more of the mature process, the memory rebound or basically share gains? What's going to be the biggest driver of the Delta, and the second half of the year of revenues?
Kevin Brewer: So the driver, as we look at the year is going to be the mature markets and our continued spread, we got a large diverse customer base there. So increasing our footprint, which we are doing by focusing in on key application needs, and that's driving a lot of our R&D investment, relative to the product extension. So that's, that's probably a number one. And again, as we said before, when memory comes back, that that will impact, if it comes back sooner than – we’ll be higher. If it comes back later than you know, we'll be lower. We know that's a big piece of the market.
Mark Miller: You mentioned advanced logic I believe is one of the evals. Could you give us a little more – update us on where the evals are going currently?
Mary Puma: In terms of where they are?
Mark Miller: Right.
Mary Puma: Okay. So we have three evals right now. One is in advanced logic, one is in memory and one is in image sensors.
Mark Miller: Okay. And finally, is the market from the domestic Chinese, now manufacturers, that's similar to press right now, but you were expecting that's going to pick up or is that somewhat stronger than the overall memory market?
Mary Puma: Well, I mean if you look at China, China is obviously comprised of multiple customers in multiple types of segments and China overall, there clearly have been some delays in new China projects based on both fab construction delays, and also on market conditions and certainly the memory slowdown is impacting those customers who are serving the memory market. But China continues to be 20% to 30% of Axcelis’ revenues. Although I just want to remind people that a significant portion of our business in China comes from the global semiconductor companies versus the domestic customers and for the slowdowns and fab constructions that that tends to be with the domestic Chinese customers.
Kevin Brewer: And Mark, let me just add to that. I think the other thing that's notable is if you look at our geographic spread, this particular quarter, China was still above 20%, but the mix – the spread was pretty interesting. It was around 20% for a Korea, around 20% for China, around 20% for the U.S. and Europe. And then we had our first shipments to Japan, which accounted for a 10%. And so it's a much more diverse grouping then you would typically see when memory is very strong in which we see a much heavier weighting towards the Korean market.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, Mary and Kevin, congratulations on the strong gross margin in the December quarter. I want to just – you've talked a lot about the mix shifting for memory, did mature logic/foundry in 2019. I'm just kind of curious, do you expect the mature logic/foundry business to actually increase year-on-year or is it more likely to be flat, given just the overall decline in WFE?
Mary Puma: Go ahead, Doug.
Douglas Lawson: Yes. I think it's year-over-year as a mix. It's kind of interesting in the last three years is come out over the year pretty much a split. I mean even this year it's for the year, it's relatively close to split fairly evenly, whereas the first half was much more weighted towards memory in the second half, much more weighted towards mature. It's hard to say at this point, when memory is coming back, so will next year be heavily weighted towards mature. This year, 2019, it will be weighted towards mature? Really depends on when the memory market comes back. In terms of exact revenue year-over-year, we don't break that out specifically. We have a very strong and diverse customer base there that continues to grow when with us focusing in on many of their needs, like the image sensor, power device market. So productivity needs a mature foundry. We think that's fertile ground to grow share.
Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. And I guess kind of – it doesn't sound like it, but I'll ask the question. Obviously a lot of weakness in a premium handset markets that could impact the CMOS image sensor business. It doesn't sound like you've seen any sort of slow down, related to the smartphone end of the image sensor market.
Kevin Brewer: Well, the interesting thing there is a lot of our focus is on, the image sensor customers, future needs and so forth. And one of the strong growth areas from an implant perspective is in infrared and deep reds, which are less driven by the mobile phone market. And so those require higher energies. So our product extensions like the VXC have done extremely well in that market and those sell for much higher price than a standard high energy tool.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. And then lastly, Kevin, if I heard you correctly said gross margin for Q1 would be in the 41% range, but for the year, margins expect to be 40% to 41%. You've talked a lot about the cost improvement programs. It looks like volume, certainly would be working in your favor as you come sequentially through the years. So what's the offset to gross margin to have it sort of trend down to say 40.5% for the year from 41% in the first quarter.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So we're 40.6% last year, so then point is we're basically flat year-over-year. A lot of the impact this year to the flatness is this – the overall mix it we have in there. And I will say that we are experienced some headwinds from the tariffs right now. We expect that some point to recover a lot of that through a duty drawback program, but we still have not been accepted into that program but expect that to happen. So and we have in the other thing is to the number of evals is that we have going to be recognized this year with some drag on the margins. So I think got us out of the fact is.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Gus Richard with Northland. Your line is now open.
Gus Richard: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Typically going into a quarter, how much backlog coverage do you have? What's the range?
Kevin Brewer: Well, I'll be point as a backlog is right now into this quarter. So I don't think we're over a $100 last year, but I think more importantly is the backlog number. Although its sounds important, many times will – we'll get an order booked and shipped in the same quarter and depending on the customers, we have some customers that give us a purchase order within a few days of shipping. So whereas you'll have on the customers, but the purchase order out there several months ahead, which ends up in your backlog? So yes, I'm not going to say I don't like a healthy backlog number, but it's not really indicative of what the current quarter is going to be doing.
Gus Richard: Right. I was just curious what the range was. Is it typically two-thirds to 120 is it 52 – just what the ranges?
Kevin Brewer: I have to go back. I don't really have that. I mean I've told you last year, I don't think it's about 100. So 40 to 100. I can take back to last year give you that.
Gus Richard: Okay. And then in the mature markets, excluding power and imaging, you've got a lot of mature that’s foundries. What's the Geo location of that demand? Is it out of China? Is that U.S., Europe, where is it?
Kevin Brewer: It's planet wide. So it's driven by IBMs that there's a bunch of IBMs in Europe it's driven by foundries in Asia, it's driven – it's just everywhere. It's the big driver is – there's just such a large product mix that are flowing into these fabs, that the high current implant, steps become bottlenecks for the fabs. And so that's, that's probably the number one driver in terms of the productivity. And then in – more specialized markets like image sensor and powered device. There's very specific implant needs that can be optimized to improve their yields and device performances.
Gus Richard: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then my last one for me, you mentioned that the demand and CMOS image sensors was more in the infrared, deep-red. Is that are your customers building sensors for computer vision and autonomous vehicles? Is that the incremental demand?
Kevin Brewer: They don't specifically tell us exactly what they're selling – their products too, but in general, the infrared and reds are automotive, aerospace, defense in other industrial applications. So a lot of vision type applications. So it's beyond – well beyond the mobile phone, although by enhancing the reds on the mobile phone, you do end up with better quality image sensors. So I think it cuts across the board, Gus.
Gus Richard: Okay.
Kevin Brewer: I think your backlog number for six quarters? Going back to three, sorry. So it's anywhere from 58 as high as 89. So 58, 89 over the last six quarters.
Gus Richard: Thank you. That's very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion today. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Brian. So we are looking forward to an exciting year for Axcelis and as always, I want to thank you for your continued support and hope to see you in the coming months and one of the several investor trips we have planned. And this includes the SFG Eighth Annual Technology Conference on March 12 in New York City. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now have disconnect. Good day.";[-0.3034288733688989, -0.0860615879110006];-0.0860615879110006;-0.3034288733688989;0
24;ACLS;2019-05-09;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the Company's results for the First Quarter of 2019. My name is Joelle, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Joelle. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website, as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC safe harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Q1 was a solid quarter for Axcelis despite continued difficult market conditions. Revenue for the quarter was $91.5 million, with better than forecasted earnings of $0.18 per share, driven by strong systems gross margins and tightly controlled spending. Memory accounted for only 30% of our shipments in the quarter, with the bulk of shipments, 70%, going to mature foundrylogic customers. We expect the full year to reflect a similar imbalance in our segment mix. The geographic mix of our segment's system shipments for the first quarter was Korea, 28%; China, 16%; Taiwan, 26%; U.S. and Europe, 17%; and the rest of the world, 13%; highlighting the memory market slowdown as well as delayed investment activity in China. We anticipate weakness in the broad market throughout 2019 resulting from continuing softness in memory and in mature process technologies in some geographies. Lower fab utilization across the industry is expected, as customers manage their inventories, which, combined with more conservative expense control, will likely reduce our after-market revenue. These conditions are impacting our financial outlook for Q2 and could make the remainder of 2019 challenging as well. For the second quarter, we are forecasting revenues of approximately $80 million, gross margins of approximately 40%, operating profit of approximately $2 million and EPS in the range of $0.01 to $0.03. If current market conditions continue, we believe 2019 revenues could be down by 15% compared to 2018. We can't influence market conditions. So we will focus on what we can control. Our objectives are to maintain profitability and prepare for the next upturn. We will aggressively control our costs to manage through the downturn, while continuing to invest in R&D for new segment-focused products. These new products create competitive differentiation that supports our customers' technology and manufacturing needs and will fuel growth as the market recovers. These development efforts will focus on Purion product extensions for the image sensor market for advanced image sensor products, and on the powered device market in silicon carbide as well as silicon. Additionally, we will be investing in Purion H product extensions specifically targeting the productivity needs of the mature process technology market and the advanced technology requirements of leading-edge logic customers. The fundamentals of the datacenter connected world have not changed. The cycle continues to be driven by IoT in the mature foundry/logic market, data storage in the 3D NAND market, and data analytics and AI in the DRAM and advanced logic segments. 5G proliferation over the next few years will create another boost to this cycle across all segments. In the near term, we will be patient and manage our business for profitability and future growth, while our customers work down inventories and memory supply and demand come back into alignment. Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. I'm very pleased with the company's gross margin and earnings per share performance in Q1 given the market conditions. We're 100% focused on managing through this extended downturn for profitability without sacrificing our future growth. I'm managing our costs assuming revenues could be down 15% below 2018. Currently, we anticipate Q2 and Q3 to be at bottom of the cycle, the recovery beginning in Q4. As a result, we have cut planned 2019 operating expenses by approximately $12 million through reductions in headcount, variable compensation and some push-out of infrastructure-related projects. While we reduced our expected expenditures, we have not delayed key product development efforts critical to resuming a strong growth trajectory as we exit this downturn. We're also continuing to work on gross margin improvement initiatives required to achieve margin targets in a long-term business model. I'll turn to the first quarter financial results. Q1 revenue finished at $91.5 million compared to $105.7 million in Q4. Q1 system sales were $57.1 million compared to $64.6 million in Q4. Q1 CS&I revenue finished at $34.4 million compared to $41.1 million in Q4. We expect CS&I revenues to continue to be under pressure in 2019 as customers more tightly control expenses. This will likely result in a reduction in sales of upgrades, spare parts and consumables. At this point, I recommend modeling CS&I quarterly revenue at $35 million for the next couple of quarters, with a slight recovery towards the end of the year. Q1 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 83% of our total sales, flat to Q4, with three customers at 10% or above. Q1 system bookings were $46.8 million compared to $42.1 million in Q4, with a Q1 book-to-bill ratio of 0.83 versus 0.67 in Q4. Backlog in Q1 including deferred revenue finished at $53.1 million compared to $65.1 million in Q4. Q1 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $30.4 million or 33.2% of revenue, compared to $32 million or 30.3% in Q4. Q1 total operating expenses finished $2.6 million lower than guidance as a result of cost containment actions previously mentioned. SG&A in the quarter was $16.7 million, with R&D at $13.7 million. In Q2, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately flat with Q1 and stay at that level for the remainder of 2019. Q1 gross margin was 41% compared to 41.2% in Q4. Q1 gross margin was driven by continued progress on our margin improvement initiatives and mix, regarding Q2 margin of approximately 40%, which includes a recognition of an evaluation tool and a less favorable mix of planned tool shipments. For the full year 2019, we still expect gross margins to be in the 40% to 41% range. Operating profit in Q1 was $7.1 million compared to $11.5 million in Q4, regarding Q2 operating profit of approximately $2 million. Q1 net income was $6.1 million or $0.18 per share, compared to $8.5 million or $0.25 per share in Q4, regarding Q2 earnings per share in a range of $0.01 to $0.03. Q1 inventory ended at $134.1 million compared to $129 million in Q4, driven by higher number of evaluation tools. Q1 inventory turns excluding eval tools finished at 1.8 compared to 2.1 in Q4. Q1 accounts payable were $30 million compared to $36 million in Q4. Q1 receivables were $71 million compared to $78.7 million in Q4. Q1 cash finished at $170 million compared to $184.9 million in Q4. This reflects payment of previously accrued expenses. Did not buy back any shares in the quarter and still have a $35 million share repurchase plan in place. As this industry downturn continues, we will maintain tight cost control while we invest in initiatives that are critical to achieving our $550 million business model. Investment in our products is key to achieving our growth objectives. Our long-term model, which reflects gross margin of 42% to 43%, operating profit of 17% to 18% and free cash flow greater than 15% can be found on the company website. I'll now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin.The success of Purion products, along with the large and diverse nature of our customer base, have allowed Axcelis to remain profitable through this downturn without sacrificing development projects critical to our future growth. I am confident that with our continued focus on customer needs, the technology development to support those needs and the dedication of our employees, Axcelis will continue to grow and achieve market share leadership in ion implantation. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Duley, with Steelhead.
David Duley: I was wondering if you could highlight for us what you think the second half revenue will do versus the first half. I know you mentioned, I think, that revenue would be down or could be down 15% for the year. Could you just talk about the implications for the second half of the year?
Mary Puma: Well, we said that we think that Q2 and Q3 are probably bumping along the bottom at this point. And then, we expect an improvement in Q4.
David Duley: And what do you think would get better in Q4?
Mary Puma: So what we're looking at right now is we think that the memory recovery has actually pushed from late this year likely into early 2020. What we think will get better towards the end of the year is the mature process technology segment. That should start to pick up late in the year. And along with that, we expect improved fab utilization, which would also provide some improvement in our CS&I or aftermarket revenues.
David Duley: And then, you mentioned some geographic weakness. Could you talk about where you are seeing that?
Mary Puma: Yes. What we're seeing right now is actually, a lot of it is tied to China, and the fact that there have been some delays in new projects based on both fab construction issues and also market conditions. And this is the overlap that we're seeing mainly with the mature process technology segment. I mean, obviously, there is some slowdown on the memory side as well in some of what I'll call the global customers. But in the mature process technology area in China, that's certainly something where we've seen some weakness.
David Duley: Final question from me. Could you talk about, this calendar year, what sort of expectations you have for the high-end foundry/logic space and Japan?
Mary Puma: Well, we are proceeding with the plans that we have in both of those segments. We have an evaluation in the advanced foundry/logic segment that continues on and that we expect could provide some additional revenue in the future. And in Japan, we're making continued progress with SCREEN Semiconductor. We had their management team over here a couple of weeks ago. And there's a lot of progress that's been made in terms of getting the customer accounts' plans in place and activities rolling there, as well as with the demo and training center in Hikone. So again, that's proceeding as planned. But that, as we've talked about, both of those segments, in fact, are places that we've talked about, where it could take some additional time to see any meaningful revenue from those two segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Ho, with Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Mary, maybe as a follow-up to your comments on the mature process node, are you seeing specific applications that are driving, I guess, the slowdown in spending by the customers? I guess, what I'm getting at is like automotive, smartphone -- are you seeing those specific applications driving the slowdown in that segment?
Mary Puma: Yes, Doug is going to respond to that.
Doug Lawson: It appears that it's kind of spread. It's sort of geography-based, as Mary said, with the Chinese economy. And China in general will be driving a bunch of it. That's led to a lot of high inventories by many of the customers in this segment. So that allows them in general to ramp down some of their fab capacities a little bit. As that inventory bleeds off, then we would expect these utilizations will go back up, helping our service business and then leading to additional system sales. So I don't think it's one specific segment.
Patrick Ho: Great. Kevin, maybe as a follow-up -- gross margins are hanging in really well despite the projected decline in revenues for the June quarter. Are you still seeing, I guess, the cost out initiatives you talked about in the past having an effect? And as we progress through this year and into 2020, they become a bigger impact, allowing you to keep gross margin at 40% and above, especially at these lower revenue levels?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. I mean, we are making continued progress on the cost out, Patrick. We've had these multiyear gross margin improvement roadmaps in place. The business is executing well to those. There are still a number of cost improvement projects that are teed up through engineering as well as supply chain. And also, too, on the product extensions, these are areas where we've been able to deliver better pricing. So the product extensions are also helping move the margins. But we're still working the margins very hard. As I said in the call, we've pulled back on some of the operating expenses. But things critical to future growth or margin improvement, we're still spending in those areas that drive improvement.
Doug Lawson: And Patrick, just one other thing to add. Both Mary and Kevin commented on investing in the new products. All of those new products are being designed very much with improved gross margins in mind.
Patrick Ho: And final question from me, on the product extensions front. That's obviously a great way to, one, keep your existing customer base on the Axcelis platform; but also present potentially new opportunities. How do you balance, I guess, the requirements or, I guess, the productivity improvements that customers are looking for and providing the right extensions? I guess, what I'm trying to get at -- how do you invest appropriately, and not across the board just because a customer requests something?
Doug Lawson: So we have a strong marketing group that spends a lot of time with our customers. We actually spend a lot of time with, in the case of foundries, our customers, to really understand where the market's going and what the needs will be, so that we can balance that versus an individual customer request, versus what the market overall needs. And then we make our decisions based on that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Ellis, with B. Riley. Your line is now open.
Peter Peng: Hi. This is actually Peter Peng, filling in for Craig Ellis. And thanks for taking our question. On your memory shipment, the 30% -- can you provide a rough radar between DRAM and NAND mix?
Mary Puma: Yes. The DRAM was about 12% of the 30%, and Flash was the remaining 18%.
Peter Peng: And then, just on the gross margin, if I look at your Slide 20, there seems to be a visible improvement the last two quarters. It looked like a point improvement per quarter. Can you talk about the underlying drivers there?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So it's continuing to come from margin improvement initiatives that the company has ongoing, which include supply chain, value engineering, improvements in the warrantee and install costs as these tools become mature, and repeat orders go in fabs; we see those costs come down. And then, again, it's the product extensions that we were just discussing. We get better pricing with the extensions, so that's helping to drive the margins. As you know, we've made a lot of progress over the last years focusing really on the systems margins. We always say that the service side of the business of CS&I is very accretive. And in our investor presentation, you can see the improvement in standard margins that come across really in the Purion platform. So the good news is we haven't run out of ideas on how to improve things more. And we're working through a number of initiatives still. So that's what's really propping these gross margins up to the point where we feel comfortable keeping the full year at 40% to 41% and our longer-term model at the 42% to 43%.
Peter Peng: And then, one more for me. Can you talk about what the triggers are for activating your share buyback program?
Kevin Brewer: The only [indiscernible] I can tell you is that we're going to be opportunistic. We're in a blackout period right now, and it's something that Mary and I will review from time to time. And we've discussed some trigger points to the board as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gus Richard, with Northland.
Gus Richard: Just to follow up on mature products, is it reasonable to assume that the power semiconductor guys [indiscernible] CMOS semi sensors remains strong, and then you've got some weakness in emerging companies in China? Would that sort of be a good explanation of the weakness?
Doug Lawson: Yes, I think, Gus, the power devices and [indiscernible] sensors certainly continued to be strong. As you know, the mature segment makes up a very large number of products and devices; it's a very big customer base in terms of fabs, but also in terms of fabless customers. And so it's more on the rest of those products that are impacted. And when you look at the China market, the economy's not doing as well. And that's cut back on some of the electronic spending that's impacted some of the Chinese customers of ours. But it also impacts some non-Chinese customers of ours that ship to China. So it's probably more on the impact of the non-CMOS semi sensor or power device market.
Gus Richard: And then, your annual guidance is for roughly down 15%. You also state that Q2 and Q3 are going to expect to be the bottom, which would imply September probably below Q1. If you do the math, you kind of come up with in excess of 20% sequential growth in the fourth quarter. And again, A, am I doing the math right? And B, what gives you the confidence two quarters out?
Kevin Brewer: Yes, I mean, the math is right. We have the Q1 number. We've basically said flat Q2, Q3, kind of the bottom. So the remainder of the delta is sitting in Q4.
Mary Puma: Right. And I mentioned earlier that we expect the mature process technology segment to potentially pick up in Q4 and, along with that, the aftermarket or our CS&I business, as we believe fab utilization will begin to improve in that quarter as well. So you're looking at it the right way.
Doug Lawson: And Gus, I think from a confidence endpoint, if you look at even what our customers and customers' customers especially have discussed during this earnings season, there's been a lot of discussion about their inventory and their plans over the next couple of quarters to bring that down. And so that will drive the improvement in terms of the mature business from a fab standpoint.
Gus Richard: Okay. And then, just last one for me. And I'm sorry I didn't do the math on this. I think the cash declined about $15 million in the quarter. Could you just walk me through the uses of cash?
Kevin Brewer: Well, at a high level, it was expenses that were accrued last year. And there was some capital spending in there as well.
Gus Richard: Okay, got it. That makes sense. All right. Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Gus.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Miller, with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller: You indicated the mature founders in China were weak or weakening. And I was just wondering about the Chinese domestic NAND producers -- are they scaling back? I know other large companies are scaling back. But are they trying to ramp still? Or are they throttling back their capital spending?
Doug Lawson: They're still planning to ramp. They're still at a very low level in terms of wafer starts, and so probably not really having a meaningful impact on the overall NAND market at this point. But they will plan to continue to ramp through this year and could start to have some meaningful impact on the market as you go into 2020.
Mark Miller: Are you expecting any improvements in Europe? Or that's going to remain flat or down over the next couple quarters?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. I think Europe falls into the category of, for us, largely mature process technologies. So it's kind of grouped with that analysis that we would expect that that would ramp up a little bit as we get into the later part of the year.
Mark Miller: Excuse me.
Mary Puma: I was going to say, Mark, there's a lot of planning going on in Europe right now for some new projects that will be coming online in 2020.
Mark Miller: When do you think 5G will start showing up as being a positive impact? That's later in this year or next year, terms of 5G rollout?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So 5G will affect the entire market. It's not just the 5G devices. So as 5G ramps, it increases the ability to get data from one point to another much faster, which means you tend to increase storage and analytical capability and so forth, in addition to all of the communication devices that are involved. So, I think it's a gradual ramp over the next few years, actually. So it probably provides another kicker even through this cycle as we come out.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christian Schwab, with Craig-Hallum Capital.
Christian Schwab: I jumped on a little late. But Mary, can you talk about what happened during the quarter that you now expect memory weakness into 2020, versus previous expectations of potentially improving near the end of the year, if there's any specifics regarding delayed times and push-outs, or what you're hearing from the customer base?
Mary Puma: Well, I mean, there are a number of projects out there that we had originally anticipated potentially could start taking equipment in the fourth quarter. And from discussions with our customers and continuing to pulse the market, what we're hearing now is that those projects will not, in fact, start to take equipment until early 2020. So that's really essentially what changed is just planning on the part of our customers.
Christian Schwab: And is that on both DRAM and NAND or any other further specifics you could add there?
Mary Puma: Yes, it's across the board, basically. I mean, we all know that there are certain large memory customers who have a number of projects in both DRAM and Flash that will proceed at some point. But again, the timing now appears to be early next year versus late this year.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: So we have a busy investor conference schedule in Q2, and we hope to see you at one of these conferences. We will be at the 20th Annual B. Riley & Company Investor Conference on May 22nd in LA, the 16th Annual Craig-Hallum Institutional Investor Conference on May 29th in Minneapolis, the Stifel Cross-Sector Insights Conference on June 12th in Boston and the Ideas Conference on June 13th, also in Boston. Thank you for your support.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[-0.046105847515253484, -0.019001190773198062];-0.019001190773198062;-0.046105847515253484;0
25;ACLS;2019-08-07;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company's results for the Second Quarter of 2019. My name is Jimmy and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Jimmy. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release.Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results, are forward-looking statements, under the SEC Safe Harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.Revenue in the second quarter of $74.3 million was in line with our revised guidance. Earnings per share of $0.02 was higher than expected due to lower operating expenses resulting from cost reduction actions and continued tight spending controls. Gross margins of 42.7% above guidance also contributed to our profitability. During our last earnings call we talked about the second and third quarters forming the trough of this cycle for Axcelis. So, as expected, we continue to bounce along the bottom of this memory driven downturn.During the second quarter, memory accounted for just 20% of our shipments with the majority of shipments 80% going to mature foundry/logic customers, particularly those manufacturing power devices and image sensors. We believe that our full year systems mix will also be heavily weighted toward the mature foundry/logic segment.Geographic mix of our systems shipments in the second quarter was more balanced than usual. China 35%; Korea 31%; The U.S. and Europe 23%; and Taiwan 11%. This regional breakout, which includes Korea, is also reflective of a strong mature foundry/logic mix. For the third quarter, we are forecasting revenues between $65 million and $75 million and gross margins of approximately 41%. We expect the operating profit to range between a loss of $1.2 million to a profit of $2 million and EPS in the range of breakeven plus or minus $0.05.During the second quarter, we saw a significant increase in quote activity both for systems in the mature foundry/logic segment and for CS&I upgrades. Although, this should have a positive impact on our business beginning in the fourth quarter we do not anticipate a memory recovery until the first half of 2020. As a result, we now estimate 2019 revenues could be down between 20% to 25% compared to 2018, implying an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter.While we can't influence market conditions we will continue to focus on what we can control, maintaining profitability and preparing for the next upturn. Our goal throughout this extended downturn has been to continue our investment in new product development efforts, while aggressively managing our costs.As a result, we are working closely with our customers to develop new segment-focused products. Our development efforts are focused on Purion product extensions for advanced image sensor products and on the power device market in silicon carbide as well as silicon. Additionally, we will be investing in Purion H product extension specifically targeting the productivity needs of the mature process technology market and the advanced technology requirements of leading-edge logic customers.In new Purion products, our designed to create a sustainable competitive differentiation to support our customers' technology and manufacturing needs for critical implant steps. With four evaluation systems in the field and additional eval systems expected to ship during the second half of the year, we continue to plant seeds that will fuel growth when the market recovers.Now, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. I'm very pleased with our second quarter gross margin performance and continued profitability during this extended downturn. Purion product extensions, margin improvement initiatives and mix are all fueling solid gross margin performance. At this point, we now expect full year average gross margin to be 40% to 41.5%, up from our prior guidance of 40% to 41%.With regards to our operating expenses and continuing to tightly controlled spending. We have implemented additional actions to lower our costs, which include voluntary executive pay cuts, further reductions in headcount and variable compensation and continued across the board tightening.While we reduced our expected expenditures, we've not delayed key product development efforts critical to resuming strong growth as we exit this downturn. We're also continuing to fund gross margin improvement initiatives, required to achieve our long-term business model. We remain focused on managing through this extended downturn for profitability, while sacrificing our future growth. Currently, we see Q2 and Q3 at the bottom of the cycle for the recovery in shipments beginning in Q4.Our balance sheet is strong. And during the quarter, we repurchased $14 million of stock as part of our $35 million share repurchase program. We plan to continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases. We still have $21 million of spending authorized under the program.Now turning to the second quarter financial results. Q2 revenue finished at $74.3 million and in line with our revised guidance of approximately $75 million, compared to $91.5 million in Q1. Q2 system sales were $37.2 million compared to $57.1 million in Q1. Q2 CS&I revenue finished at $37.1 million, compared to $34.4 million in Q1. We expect our CS&I revenues to begin to recover in Q4.Q2 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 79% of our total sales, compared to 83% in Q1 with four customers at 10% or above compared to three customers in Q1. Q2 system bookings were $25.1 million, compared to $46.8 million in Q1, with a Q2 book-to-bill ratio of 0.7 versus 0.83 in Q1. Backlog in Q2 including deferred revenue finished at $36 million compared to $53.1 million in Q1.As Mary previously mentioned, we've seen a significant increase in quoting activity which should lead to a rebound starting in Q4. Q2 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $29.7 million or 40% of revenue compared to $30.4 million or 33.2% in Q1.Q2 total operating expenses finished $0.7 million lower than our guidance including an incremental expense of $0.6 million of headcount reductions.SG&A in the quarter was $16 million with R&D at $13.7 million. In Q3, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be flat with Q2 and stay at that level for the remainder of the year.Q2 gross margin was 42.7% compared to 41% in Q1. Q2 gross margin was driven by Purion product extensions and cost-out as well as mix. Since the introduction of the full Purion product line, we've improved system standard margin nearly 1,900 basis points on a rolling four-quarter average.We're guiding Q3 gross margin of approximately 41% which includes a recognition of two lower margin evaluation tools. For the full year 2019, we now expect gross margin to be approximately 41% to 41.5%.Operating profit in Q2 finished at $2 million compared to $7.1 million in Q1. Q2 net income was $0.6 million or $0.02 per share and above our revised guidance of an expected loss compared to $6.1 million or $0.18 per share in Q1.We're guiding Q3 earnings per share of breakeven plus or minus $0.05. Q2 inventory ended at $135.1 million compared to $134.1 million in Q1, driven by an increase in eval tool inventory. Q2 inventory turns excluding evaluation tools finished at 1.4 compared to 1.8 in Q1.Q2 accounts payable were $21.8 million compared to $29.6 million in Q1. Q2 receivables were $62.3 million compared to $70.9 million in Q1. Q2 cash finished at $143.2 million compared to $170 million in Q1.In the quarter, we invested in capital equipment to support Purion customer demos and procure additional evaluation tool inventory for new Purion products. We also purchased $14 million of stock under our share repurchase program.As this industry downturn continues we are maintaining tight cost control, while investment initiatives critical to achieving our $550 million business model. A $550 million model which reflects gross margin of 42% to 43%, operating profit of 17% to 18%, and free cash flow greater than 15% can be found in our investor presentation on the company website.I will now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. This has been a long deep downturn for the industry. To date, Axcelis has maintained profitability without sacrificing critical product development investment and our goal is to extend our track record into Q3. Our success is a result of the strength of the Purion products that are either process tool of record at, or currently being evaluated by, our large and diverse customer base. I am confident that with our continued focus on customer needs the technology development to support those needs and the dedication of our employees, Axcelis will continue to grow and achieve market share leadership in ion implantation.With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Christian Schwab: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the memory recovery that's expected in the first half of 2019 -- I mean, first half of 2020. Would you expect that to be a gradual recovery or a ladder step recovery at some point during the year? And would you expect that to be driven by increased spending on DRAM or NAND, or both? What is your current thoughts on that?
Mary Puma: So it's not exactly clear to us how -- what the trajectory of the recovery will be. I mean, as you know, in most recoveries it sort of upon us by the time we realize we're in a recovery. But we do expect it will be in the first half of the year. And we expect that NAND will recover before DRAM does.
Christian Schwab: Okay, great. And then, the assumption for $550 million, can you walk us through either what type of recovery in memory capital spending we would need from current levels, or does it have to get back to the type of intensity we saw in 2017 for that to happen, or is that a combination of steady -- healthy spending in memory and foundry/logic as well as some potential gains over time in Japan? Can you just walk us through the path that you guys have in your mind to get to $550 million?
Mary Puma: Sure. So our assumptions and expectations about $550 million haven't really changed despite the fact that perhaps the timing has been pushed out a little bit now, because of the downturn. We still expect that we can achieve the $550 million model over the next two to three years.And it's really based on the latter, the second scenario that you laid out. We expect healthy memory spending to contribute to our share that we would get -- our fair share that we would get in memory. The mature process technology will remain relatively stable and strong.And then, I think, the third point you made which is right on is the gaining market share in several of the areas where we're working right now to make some new penetrations in the area of advanced foundry/logic and also in Japan. So, yes, all of those things will contribute to the $550 million model, again, in the next couple of years, several years.
Christian Schwab: Great. Thank you. No other questions.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, Christian.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Peter Peng: Hey, guys. This is actually Peter Peng calling in for Craig Ellis. And thanks for taking our question. Just on the Q3 outlook, the $70 million. It seems like it's about a 1.2 step down. Just wondering, directionally, is this coming from memory or is this more mature foundry?
Mary Puma: I mean, we talked about how 80% of our shipments were to mature foundry/logic and only 20% to memory. And I can also tell you that, we talked about producing a pretty large uptick in bookings, in the second quarter particularly at the end of the quarter. And I can tell you that our bookings for the quarter were over 80% mature process technology and obviously under 20% for memory.So it really is the mature foundry/logic at this point in time that is continuing to carry us. We've talked about how the fact that we have a large diverse customer base. So that's really where we're seeing the improvement which again leads us to say that we don't believe that the memory recovery will happen until sometime in the first half of next year.
Peter Peng: Great. And then just on the implicit 4Q. It seems like the implicit based on this calendar 2019 view is somewhere around $107 million. And if it's mostly foundry and logic then that's a pretty big number potentially doubling from 3Q levels. I'm wondering how diverse is that customer base there on that ramp?
Mary Puma: Well, it's pretty diverse. I mean, we talked about how we actually had more of a balance this quarter and we talked about how that mature foundry/logic waiting would continue on through the remainder of the year and likely as average out that way for the year.Again if I take a look at our bookings, I would say that our bookings are pretty reflective of a similar type of geography split and I already mentioned the split on the mature process technology versus memory.So it's pretty well rated around the world. But I would also say that China at this point in time is coming on quite strong. Well we have and continue to see delays at some projects that are a function of them getting their funding and some construction delays in general. We see that activity in China picking up pretty strongly as part of that increased quoting activity that we've been seeing.
Kevin Brewer: And Peter I'd point out that if you look at our percent of revenue coming from the top 10 customers the number one on this quarter would suggest we have more people participating. So it's spreading out even beyond the top 10. And also within customers that had 10% or more we increased from 3 to 4, so, again, it's all -- it all demonstrates that the footprint is spreading out a little bit.
Peter Peng: And one more question if I may. Just on the gross margin. Great job on the gross margin, it seems like 75 basis points improvement from prior view. Can you I guess just talk about and provide some color on where that upside is coming from? Is it just one or two things, or I wanted to just to get more on the gross margin upside?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So I mean the product extensions are adding to margin improvement. And those are the silicon carbide tools and some of the other high energy products, we have out there. We have continued to do very well even in an environment of low-volume with cost out through value engineering.So although, we're not necessarily getting a lot of extra out of the supply chain at this point because of volumes are down, we're continuing through value engineering to make cost improvements that we're putting into the tools.And then the third component is the mix. As always the mix of systems versus CS&I is always a mix within the systems of the products which Purion product going up. But what I can say is that, cost out continues to be part of our margin improvement roadmap as we move forward from here and going to the 42% to 43%. And also those levels look a little bit more of a play out of volume when the revenues increase.
Peter Peng: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up. Just in light of this could the 42% to 43% in your $550 million model be more of a -- more I guess a base case now, or more even more conservative just given the improvement?
Kevin Brewer: Well, I mean we're certainly ahead of where we thought would be this year a little bit right now based on the revised guidance. Again because the mix is such a big piece of it depending, on which Purion's we're selling more of in that 550 model that can impact it. But for now we're saying 42% to 43% I'm not going to tell you that when we update the model the next revision that things could potentially change. I don't expect them to change going down. So if anything we could find maybe find a little bit more there. But for now Peter we're going to stand on the 42% to 43% until you do a risk growth.
Peter Peng: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Duley with Steelhead. Your line is now open.
David Duley: Thanks for taking my question. In the memory market, although we're not seeing expansion of capacity, I think both in NAND and DRAM they're marching down the shrink curve or going up in the layer curve depending upon, which markets you're in. How did those changes in layer counts or in process technology in DRAM impact the demand for implanters?
Doug Lawson: Okay, Dave. This is Doug. So on NAND when they add layers, we don't necessarily see additional implants. So that's -- NAND is a little bit more wafer count, wafer start based. DRAM when they do shrinks, they do tend to finest the implants, which creates some new implant opportunity. But in addition we're spending a lot of time with especially the Purion H and the high current family with memory manufacturers adding new recipes to the new technologies as they come on board. So unassociated with the layer count or the shrink, we are expecting to gain some share over this next -- next move to technology just based on additional recipes.
David Duley: Okay. And could you give us an update just about your progress that you might have made or where we're at with the high-end foundry/logic business?
Mary Puma: Yeah. So we successfully completed the evaluation and we demonstrated significant throughput advantages over our competitor going into the evaluation and then actually exceeded these performance levels throughout the evaluation. So as a result we were qualified for heated implant steps at several advanced nodes.Unfortunately the productivity improvements we provided significantly reduced the number of new tools that the customer required and it was down to quite a small number. I think it was two tools. So given that the customer only needed a very small number of tools, they decided to stay with the current supplier in the near-term given some of the risk benefit trade-offs associated with making a supplier change at this point. So we are PTOR for those nodes. But at this point in time we're not seeing any volume from it
David Duley: Okay. And then final question is I guess you mentioned what your revenue could be down for the year and that certainly implies a nice pop in the fourth quarter. Could you give us or just give us your views on what you think the overall implant market will do? Would be down as the 20% to 25% that you're projecting, or will it be down more or less or what roughly do you expect?
Kevin Brewer: Well, Dave, as you know, we sort of normalize the implant market at $1 billion plus or minus 10% overall looking over the last 10 years or so. And so our expectations this year is, it will be on the lower side of that. It's pretty difficult to exactly size it given the amount of reuse and so forth that goes on in this particular part of the market. So, we would say, we'll be on the lower side of our normalized estimate.
David Duley: Thanks. That’s it for me.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Mary, Andy, if you could give a little bit of color in this current churn. Typically should makers actually do a lot more valuation work versus buying capacity given the current market conditions? Are you seeing that type of activity increase particularly on the memory point where obviously it's been -- but there are moves to the next-generation technologies in both DRAM and NAND?
Mary Puma: So the answer to that is yes. And I think Kevin even referenced the fact that we're making a large investment in evaluation inventory. We currently have four evaluations out in the field and three of those are actually memory-related evaluations, one mature process technology. And moving forward, we will have, what I think for us is a significant number of new evals coming into play in the second half of 2019 and moving into 2020. And I think I'm going to assume you're going to come to our Investor Day in September and some of this new activity is related to some of the new product announcements that we're going to make and you'll hear more about at that event.
Kevin Brewer: Pat, just add-on, in terms of the inventory piece, we've had a significant uptick in eval inventory not just of tools that are in the field but also tools that are currently in process. So there is quite a bit of activity right now both in terms of what's field in anticipated additional tools going out
Patrick Ho: Great. That's really helpful. And Kevin maybe as my follow-up question. In terms of the incremental upside to gross margins on a going-forward basis that 42% to 43% you're making. Is that primarily that increase or that incremental increase coming from the cost-out programs, or are there other variables that will bump it up from your previous 40% to 41% to 42% to 43%.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So I should have mentioned when Peter asked the question too. The product extensions are, obviously, a piece of it as well as the cost out. So the incremental to get to the 42% to 43% is continued improvement on our margin improvement initiatives. We have detailed road maps in place. And then as product extensions we've been talking about in our Analyst Day that we're having in September we'll be sharing more detail with how product extensions as well as the cost-out will move our gross margins at the next level. And, obviously, our goal is not to stop at 42% to 43%. We're shooting for much higher but it's a journey to get there and we're making pretty good progress so far.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Brewer: Okay. Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gus Richard with Northland. Your line is now open.
Gus Richard: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk -- you mentioned that your quote activity has stepped up quite a bit. Can you just give a little more color on which part of the mature market, or is it also memory?
Mary Puma: Yes. So I think I've mentioned prior to this that the probably the two major points on the quote activity is that it is significantly heavily weighted towards mature process technology, which is not surprising given where we are in the cycle and also heavily weighted towards China, which I explained before. Obviously, there's a lot going on there. And it's China and it's China mature process technology, again just to clarify that.
Kevin Brewer: And Gus within that market there's a lot of activity on power devices and continued activity on image sensors. So those two segments continued to really provide the strength for us.
Gus Richard: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then looking into the first half you expect memory to start to recover. And I think you said NAND was going to be the first one. What evidence of them are you seeing that that recovery is going to occur, or is it just the downturn has been so long as so Steve that it just got to get better? Okay.
Mary Puma: No. I mean, obviously, we're triangulating on data points that are out there, but we're also staying pretty close to our customers. And our best take at this point in time based on discussions with them is that it will be sometime the first half of 2020. Again, I can't put a lot more clarity around that at this point.
Gus Richard: Okay. But it is the combination of conversations just for customers as well as it's been pretty rough in the memory market at this point and certainly unlikely to go lower.
Mary Puma: Yes.
Gus Richard: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, Gus.
Mary Puma: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now turn the call back over to Mary Puma who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Jimmy. We will be attending the D.A. Davidson Fast Connections 18th Annual Tech Conference on September 4th in New York City. And we also hope to see you at our Investor Day on September 24 also in New York City where we will be introducing the next wave of Purion products. Thank you for your support.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[0.11841421224462101, 0.06001208596076446];0.06001208596076446;0.11841421224462101;1
26;ACLS;2019-11-01;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies Call to discuss the company's results for the Third Quarter of 2019. My name is Gigi and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Gigi. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.Axcelis has achieved five years of consecutive quarterly profits. We believe Q3 to be the low point of the cycle and expect a gradual recovery. Based on this, we are also marking the first time we have maintained through-cycle profitability as a public company. Our accomplishments provide a strong indication of the many successful changes we have made to our business to drive revenue growth and improve profitability. I would like to open this call by thanking our employees for all their hard work, dedication and ingenuity that has made this possible.Revenue in the third quarter of $69.5 million was in line with guidance. Earnings per share of $0.02 was above the midpoint of guidance and well above consensus. Gross margins of 44% were above guidance driven by a significant mix of Purion product extensions. Strong gross margins combined with continued tight spending controls allowed us to maintain profitability for the quarter. During the third quarter, memory accounted for just 14% of our shipments, with the majority of shipments 86% going to mature foundry logic customers, particularly the manufacturing power devices and image sensors.The geographic mix of our system shipments in the third quarter was Korea 50%; China 31%; and Europe and the U.S. 19%. This breakout is reflective of a strong mature foundry logic mix in all of these regions including Korea. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting revenues to increase by 33% to 44%, ranging from $92 million to $100 million. We are also forecasting gross margins of approximately 38% driven by a systems mix that includes more base Purion H systems. We expect operating profit to range between $6 million and $9 million and EPS between $0.14 and $0.20.We expect revenues in Q4 to rebound due to increasing activity in China and continued investment by mature foundry logic customers, particularly those with an emphasis on image sensors and power devices. Although, we still expect the memory recovery to begin during the first half of 2020, we are seeing early signs of this pickup with approximately 40% of our Q4 revenue expected from the memory market, evenly split between NAND and DRAM. Quote activity during the third quarter remained strong and bookings increased significantly for systems especially in the mature foundry logic segment.At our Investor Day in September, we introduced several new product extensions to the Purion family as well as a new $650 million target business model which Kevin will discuss. All of the new Purion products focus on our customers' most challenging ion implant processes and were developed in close collaboration with customers. The new products were built on the common Purion platform, using our concurrent product development methodology. This approach enables new products to come to market with higher quality and lower initial costs. The new products all target high-value implant challenges for our customers and as a result have higher ASPs than our base Purion products.Two of the new products are high energy implanters. The high energy market has been increasing as a result of demand for multiple high energy implant steps in image sensor and powering device applications. This segment now accounts for 30% of the implant TAM. The first of these two new products is the Purion XE silicon carbide, which addresses emerging high energy implant requirements in the silicon carbide power device market. This tool marries our Purion XE beam line to the common Purion end station and utilizes the silicon carbide option originally developed for our Purion M silicon carbide product. The second high-energy product targets the most advanced image sensors.The Purion XEmax incorporates our new proprietary boost technology to deliver energy in excess of 12 MeV as well as the industry's lowest metal contamination. The next two products address critical areas in the high current market. High current represents approximately 50% to 55% of the overall ion implant market and is the product segment we are targeting for significant growth. The Purion H200 addresses productivity issues customers face for high-dose implants requiring higher energies. Silicon-powered devices as well as many mature foundry logic applications will see significant productivity and cost of ownership benefits from this new tool.The Purion H200 is a direct descendant of the original Purion H, now called the Purion H60. It uses a modified Purion spot beam architecture designed to achieve higher energy levels combined with the common Purion end station. The last product is the Purion Dragon. Also built on the common Purion platform, the Purion Dragon uses a new beam line designed to deliver high levels of process control with significant productivity gains. The Purion Dragon is targeted at advanced memory and advanced logic customers and was developed jointly with a leading memory customer.It is currently under evaluation in this customer's fab and is expected to successfully close in early 2020. These new Purion products are designed to create a sustainable competitive differentiation to support our customers' technology and manufacturing needs for critical implant steps. The Purion Dragon and the Purion XE silicon carbide are at customer sites and the first Purion H200 and Purion XEmax systems are expected to ship over the next six months.Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. Our third quarter financial performance marked our 20th consecutive quarter of profitability. Given our view that Q4 is the beginning of a gradual industry recovery, this represents the first time as a public company that we were profitable through an industry cycle. Our goal when the downturn began was to remain profitable, while making the necessary investments in the business, required to drive future growth. With disciplined spending and significant progress on gross margin improvement initiatives, we believe we have accomplished this. Q3 gross margin of 44% was well above our guidance, driven by a more favorable mix of systems and CS&I.The aerobotic extension shipped during the quarter played a significant role in boosting our margins, as did a higher mix of upgrade sales. We are still projecting full year gross margin of 41% to 41.5%. As we enter this upturn, I plan to continue to tightly control spending, while making any required investments expected to drive revenue growth. For our Investor Day on September 24, we updated our $550 million target business model by increasing gross margin to 42% to 43%. We also added a new $650 million model, the gross margin of 44% to 45%, operating profit of 20% to 21% and free cash flow greater than 17%.During the event, we highlighted the expected positive impact on gross margin from the newly released products and our plan to elect cash increase to approximately $200 million to support the $650 million model. Our balance sheet remains strong and in the quarter we generated $20 million of cash from operations. We have $21 million remaining under our share repurchase program and did not purchase any shares during the quarter.Now, I'll turn into third quarter financial results. Q3 revenue finished at $69.5 million at the midpoint of our guidance compared to $74.3 million in Q2. The three system sales were $36.8 million compared to $37.2 million in Q2.Q3 CS&I revenue finished at $32.6 million, compared to $37.1 million in Q2 driven by lower used tool shipments. Q3 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for 81.5% of our total sales compared to 78.6% in Q2, with two customers at 10% or above compared to four customers in Q2.Q3 system bookings were $80.2 million, compared to $25.2 million with a Q3 book-to-bill ratio of 2.22 versus 0.7 in Q2. As Mary previously noted, this is reflective of the early signs of a recovery.Backlog in Q3, including deferred revenue finished at $93.4 million compared to $36 million in Q2. Q3 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $28.7 million or 41% of revenue compared to $29.7 million or 40% in Q2. SG&A in the quarter was $15.8 million with R&D at $12.9 million.In Q4, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately $29.5 million. Q3 gross margin was 44% compared to 42.7% in Q2. Q3 gross margin was driven by a strong mix of Purion product extensions, CS&I upgrade sales and continued cost-out activity. We're guiding Q4 gross margin of approximately 38%, due to the less favorable mix. As we have mentioned before, gross margins are a function of several factors such as the mix of products and the portion of our accretive CS&I businesses of total revenue.DRAM products also carry different margin profiles as highlighted in our investor presentation. Evaluation tools closed within the quarter and also pressure margins. As a result of these factors, we expect to see variability from quarter-to-quarter. What remains key is, we continue to have solid execution on our gross margin improvement initiatives. Since the introduction of the full Purion product line, we have improved systems tenor margin nearly 2,100 basis points on a rolling four quarter average.For the full year 2019, we expect gross margin to be approximately 41% to 41.5% as previously noted. Operating profit in Q3 finished at $1.9 million at the top end of our guidance compared to $2 million in Q2. We're guiding Q4 operating profit of $6 million to $9 million. Q3 net income was $0.7 million or $0.02 per share and above the midpoint of guidance compared to $0.6 million also $0.02 per share in Q2.We're guiding Q4 earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.20. Q3 inventory ended at $138.4 million compared to $135.1 million in Q2. Inventory in the quarter increased to support recovering new system shipments and planned evaluation tools. Q3 inventory turns excluding evaluation tools finished at 1.2, compared to 1.4 in Q2.Q3 accounts payable were $21.3 million compared to $21.8 million in Q2. Q3 receivables were $49 million, compared to $62.3 million in Q2. Q3 cash finished at $162.2 million compared to $143.2 million in Q2. In the quarter, we generated $20 million of cash from operations.In Q3, we continued to make progress on our gross margin improvement road maps. The introduction of four new products, combined with continuing work on our cost-out initiatives are expected to fuel additional gross margin improvement. We're continuing to invest in areas of the business that can drive top and bottom line growth as reflected in our $550 million and $650 million target business models. These models along with additional materials and gross margin improvement initiatives and new products can be found in our investor presentation on the company website.Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. Axcelis is uniquely positioned with the capability, DNA and unwavering focus to solve customers' high-value, high-impact ion implantation challenges. Our new Purion products were developed to solve these difficult customer issues and we are excited to bring them to market at the perfect time, the beginning of a recovery. Partnerships with customers and collaborations with peers continue to strengthen ensuring that Axcelis can offer a continuous stream of Purion products that will allow us to grow, prosper and achieve market share leadership in ion implantation.With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Gigi?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Mary, maybe first off in terms of the market environment you talked about memory coming back gradually and it's going to be a higher percentage of your overall revenues in the December quarter. Do you believe this recovery is broader-based? Or is it concentrated primarily at one customer?
Mary Puma: No, I think it's definitely broader-based. We do see the beginnings of it as I mentioned given that 40%, we expect 40% of our revenues in Q4 to be from the memory sector and I think I mentioned that it's evenly split. That said we do believe that NAND will recover before DRAM will, but we do expect that it will continue through 2020. Again, it will be gradual versus very steep. We had a large memory customer here at Axcelis earlier this week, and that person shared with us that they also believe that NAND will recover first and said that – he said that his company is going to be reviewing plans at the end of this year to likely see spending begin at a more or pickup in Q2 of next year.And again, he also suggested that there would be a gradual recovery. So we have data points from multiple customers at this point in time that give us confidence to say that it is starting, but it's going to take some time to pick up some steam.
Patrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question for Kevin. You recently announced several new products and the extensions that you mentioned for specific application tools. How are you maintaining the cost structure for these new products given that typically new products tend to have higher costs, lower margins, stuff like the higher warranty costs things of that nature? Are these designs set up where they'll end up with higher margins at the beginning of these new product cycles versus previous product introductions? And how do you – how do these products rep potentially impact your recent trend of posting 40% plus gross margin?
Kevin Brewer: Okay. So, the first thing I would say Patrick is that, all of the new product extensions that we've introduced as well as the new Dragon product are based on the common platform of Purion. So the good news there is that, if we're using a commonality we can take advantage of the cost-out activity we have already received from the existing products.The second thing is the design phase, we're using a concurrent product development, and we're getting more input across the business upfront with the CPD initiatives. So a lot of the supply chain work the lean activity when manufacturing is being considered right upfront which also helps keep the cost structure down, so that we're not chasing this like we typically do. And I think that's what you're probably alluding to that, we've done a lot of value engineering over the years, but how do we get that in the products rep front. So we're definitely getting more cost out upfront.The third thing really is the pricing on the product extensions also is more favorable than our base products. And one of the things that Mary mentioned in her remarks was that in Q4 we're seeing a very high mix of our base Purion H products. Those are not the extensions that we talked about at the Investor Day, it's base product.So I think those are the things that are going to help us release these new products and not have the typical margin drag that we would have received with -- when we first introduced Purion, I guess, is the best way to say it.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Brewer: Okay. Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Craig Ellis: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the real significant improvement in trough cycle profitability major accomplishment there.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Craig Ellis: Mary very helpful to get some of your visibility on what you see coming with memory as we move more into a recovery. I'm wondering if you can focus on the mature boundary business and provide some similar color in terms of what you're seeing in the order book. Has this backlog improved significantly quarter-on-quarter?
Mary Puma: Well, we're obviously still seeing additional growth in that segment. And since it is a significant contributor to the increase in revenues in Q4 and even beyond that we have a little bit of visibility into what's going to happen early in 2020.A lot of that is actually being driven by three things. First is China. There's some significant spending growth in that region of the world. And although -- since our revenues typically are around 30%, and in the past we've said those revenues mainly come from the global semiconductor players, but we are seeing a significant increase in those revenues now coming from some of the domestic Chinese customers.The other areas that are driving growth in mature process technology are image sensors and also power devices. Those segments for us remain very strong, as customers come online with additional capacity.
Craig Ellis: That's very helpful. And then a follow-up for Kevin just on the prior question, but taking it a different direction. So, tremendous gross margin in the third quarter, Kevin so congratulations on the progress there. With regard to what we should expect with gross margin variability quarter-to-quarter as we move into the recovery, given that there may be some quarters where we have a real high quotient of Purion product extensions like 3Q, some quarters not, should we expect there to be more of the -- more meaningful swings in gross margin quarter-to-quarter like we're seeing from 3Q to 4Q? Or is the magnitude of change that we're seeing more unusual in our quarter-to-quarter gross margin moves more likely to be something smaller than what looks like 350 basis points quarter-to-quarter here in the back half of the year?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah. So, I guess, the best way to say is that, I would expect on a full year basis that we continue to make progress on our gross margins. And that's kind of been what we've been doing if you go back and look over the past few years.So going forward, there will be variability. There will be quarters where there's -- we could be lopsided with eval tools. We do have a number of eval tools currently out to customers, so we plan to ship more. But I think Craig the way to think about it is on a full year basis, the goal is to continue to march these gross margins higher.We do in the $550 million model have 42% to 43%, which I still think are realistic. I know we just demonstrated, we hit our $650 million model this quarter, but Q4 was a bit of a perfect storm in a good way. We had a lot of product extensions, and those really boosted the revenue level we had with some pretty good margins.But I think the important thing, again, as I mentioned is that we're continuing to really focus on gross margin improvement. We have a number of improvement initiatives in place. We also know where these new products end, because we've -- I think we've done a really good job designing costs out upfront. So, again, what I would expect is kind of gradual improvement from year-to-year as we march to the $550 million model.
Craig Ellis: That's helpful. Good luck team.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Christian Schwab from Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Christian Schwab: Hey, solid guidance. Could you give us Mary some expectations about what you expect for market share gains over the next couple of years? And if there's anything in particular we should be paying attention to in the memory sector either on DRAM or NAND?
Mary Puma: Well, I think the best way to put our expectations into perspective are to look at the two business models that we have out there. We have the $550 million model, which we said is about two years out. And then we've got the $650 million business model dollar business model, which is four years to five years out. And roughly speaking, the $550 million model is pegged to about a 40% market share and the $650 million is pegged to a 45% market share, again using a relatively flat TAM of $1 billion, which we've talked about many times before.In terms of growth in memory, there are some additional areas and various customers that we would like to penetrate and we're working very hard on doing that. So it's really a function of understanding where customers are going and then understanding how we're going to penetrate with our Purion products into those specific applications. We've talked about how we think it's a very realistic expectation to have 50% or more at any one of those given memory customers.
Kevin Brewer: And I think Christian, the other thing to remember is the Purion Dragon is one of the new products and has really been targeted at that advanced memory market. So, we would expect to see growth there both from higher ASPs on the tool, as well as strong adoption of that for the increasingly difficult implant challenge on those nodes.
Christian Schwab: Great. No other questions. Thanks.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Mary Puma: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Duley from Steelhead Securities. Your line is now open.
David Duley: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of things. Could you talk about the timing of revenue for this host of new products that you've introduced? I think you talked about when shipments were -- if you could just elaborate a little bit more and repeat whatever information you did give on that front.And also you mentioned one of these products was joint, I guess, the one for high-end memory was joint-developed with a customer. Does that come with some exclusivity with that particular customer? Or will you be able to sell that product to everybody else?
Mary Puma: Okay. So we talked about how we have two of the products out in the field. We've actually gotten revenue for the first Purion XE silicon carbide tool. The Purion Dragon is at that customer you're referencing, and I'll talk about that in a minute where we did the joint development program under evaluation and we expect the evaluation to successfully close in early 2020.And then for the other two tools, the Purion H200 and the Purion XEmax, we have customers lined up for first shipments within the next six months.So, those tools are going to start rolling out. We've got more than one customer interested in all of those tools, so we expect to get revenue. As Kevin said, there are some additional evaluations we're going to put out, which is very normal with the rollout and launch of new tools, but we also will get some revenue from some of those tools in 2020.In terms of the joint development program with that customer, it was extremely successful. It's a model that we definitely want to replicate, as we move forward and bring more product line extensions for the Purion family to market. There's no exclusivity with that customer. Obviously, they have the first system, and they will likely get the first repeat orders, but no we're free to sell that tool to other customers and are actively marketing it around the world.
David Duley: Okay. And then as far as 2019, if you hit the midpoint of your guidance in Q4, where do you think your market share in implant will be?
Kevin Brewer: Well, we're going to need to see how the year ends to really project that. But based on the $1 billion market and TAM and the fact that memory's been very low this year, we would expect lower share this year given that much of the spend has been in advanced logic. And then for us it's been very highly put in the mature logic market, so…
Mary Puma: Again, what we've been trying to do is refocus on the revenue growth, because it is very hard to estimate the TAM. So I'd like to kind of refocus you on the $550 million model and the $650 million model. And based on what's going on in the market in which customers are buying and you know all the factors that roll into that we may have some ups and downs. But we're still very much on track with $550 million in two years and $650 million in four to five years.
David Duley: Okay. Just final one for me. Could you just repeat what you expect operating expenses to be in the fourth quarter and up down as far the magnitude of dollars? Go ahead.
Kevin Brewer: $29.5 million.
David Duley: And that compares to what again?
Kevin Brewer: $28.7 million, I think it was.
David Duley: Okay. And then as far as the mix in China going forward, China was a big chunk of revenue in the current quarter I imagine, it's going to continue to be at robust levels. Are you seeing domestic Chinese memory spending in that total yet, or would that be something that happens next year?
Mary Puma: No we are seeing that currently and our expectation is that that will increase.
David Duley: Okay, thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, guys. Nice job on the results and outlook. I just want to follow up on that last question about the indigenous China. As you look into the December quarter with 40% of the business shifting back to memory, is that largely driven by the indigenous Chinese memory guys, or are you seeing that broader-based? And a follow-on question. As you talk to the memory customers especially on the NAND side and you see demand for a gradual recovery, is that kind of driven first by pilot line activity where you're seeing the orders now and then expectations that those pilot lines turn into full volume ramps at some point in 2020?
Mary Puma: Okay. So the memory that we're seeing in Q4 at this point in time is not being driven mainly by China, it's being driven by other memory customers. As I said before, we believe that the memory increase is going to be very much broad-based and that's what is currently reflected in our mix and what we can see out a quarter or so.
Kevin Brewer: And as far as the indigenous Chinese companies, there's actually a very large number of them and there's new ones popping up every day. And so that's primarily mature with the exception of one large memory company over there. And then we do see continued activity from the large Chinese foundry that we consider more of a global player.
Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. And then just that is the demand from the global memory folks today is that more pilot line activity, or do you think that this is the start of sort of capacity buys? And then my last question you've talked about the Dragon being co-developed in eval at that lead customer. Wondering if there's a sort of data points or feedback you might be able to share from that customer as you're going through that eval process. Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So as far as dragging goes that eval process is going extremely well and the tool is performing as we expect. And we think it's going to be a very good product so customer is very pleased with it to date. As far as the memory market goes, I think it's a mix Quinn. Typically implant is brought in early in a ramp. And so in this particular case, it's actually across several customers. And so as we see a lot of high energy goes in early and the initial high current needs to begin the ramp of the next node or the next generation of memory. And in this particular case, we've seen the business that we're expecting in Q4 split pretty evenly between DRAM and NAND. So it's probably a combination of ramping for some capacity, but also preparing to ramp for the next generation.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: Ma'am, you have no questions at this time. [Operator Instructions] This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Gigi. We will be in New York City several times during the next few months. First, it's the Benchmark Discovery One-on-One Conference on December 4; next at D.A.'s annual New York City Summit on December 17; and finally, at the Needham 22nd Annual Growth Conference in mid-January. We hope you can join us in New York for one of these events and also to take some time to enjoy the holiday season in the city. We will also be hosting the city research bus and semis bus tour at our headquarters in Beverly Massachusetts on December 12.Thank you for your support.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
27;ACLS;2020-02-06;"Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company's Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019. My name is Daniel and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Daniel. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy.If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release.Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits, and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor provision.These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K annual report and other SEC filings which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.2019 was a challenging year for the industry with memory spending remaining low throughout the year. But the year also showcased a very healthy Axcelis. A focused strategy on ion implant, combined with the hard work and dedication of our employees and the encouragement and support of our customers and suppliers enabled us to achieve several critical milestones in our drive to market leadership.In 2019, we continued to expand the Purion installed base, growing our large and diverse group of customers. We also sharpened our focus on key market segments in the mature process technology area such as image sensors, power devices, and mature foundry and logic.And finally, we grew our family of Purion product extensions with the launch of four new Purion implanters, specifically targeted at these segments. These new products are built on the common Purion platform and designed with our new concurrent product development methodology. This approach enables new products to come to market with higher quality and lower initial costs.Additionally, the new products all target high-value implant challenges for our customers and as a result deliver higher margins than our base Purion products. These four new Purion products are designed to create a sustainable competitive differentiation to support our customers' technology and manufacturing needs for critical implant steps.The Purion Dragon and the Purion XE silicon carbide are at customer sites while the first Purion H200 and Purion XEmax systems are currently running demos for multiple customers in our advanced technology center.We made this investment in R&D, while maintaining a vigilant eye on operating expenses. This allowed us to remain profitable through the cycle, while in 2019 delivering annual gross margins of 42%, sustaining a healthy balance sheet, and instituting a share repurchase program.Our Q4 financial performance resulted in a positive ending to this critical year. I'd like to highlight a few Q4 and full year financial results and provide Q1 guidance. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $107.7 million, a 55.1% increase over Q3. Earnings per share of $0.29 was well above guidance and consensus. Our strong Q4 financial performance was driven by a 94% increase in systems revenue, better-than-forecasted gross margins of 41.1%, and improving CS&I revenue.In 2019, revenue was $343 million with earnings per share of $0.50. During the fourth quarter, memory accounted for 39% of our shipments split evenly between DRAM and NAND. The majority of Q4 shipments, 61% went to mature foundry logic customers. For the year, memory accounted for just 29% of our shipments with 71% going to mature foundry logic customers.The geographic mix of our systems shipments in the fourth quarter was China 42%, Korea 31%, Taiwan 11%, and the rest of the world 16%. This breakout is reflective of a strong mature foundry logic mix in all of these regions, as well as improving memory shipments.Before turning to our guidance for the first quarter, I'd like to briefly touch on the coronavirus. We have put policies in place to safeguard our employees while continuing to serve our customers. It is a rapidly changing situation. And we will continue to monitor it closely.In the first quarter we are forecasting revenue of approximately $115 million. We expect gross margins of around 37%. Gross margins will be impacted by the expected closure of three Purion evaluation systems in the quarter, including the first Purion Dragon.We expect operating profit of approximately $9.5 million and EPS of about $0.21. We expect the memory segment to account for approximately 50% of our Q1 shipments, with DRAM representing about 60%, in non-volatile memory, which includes NAND and 3D cross point accounting for the remaining 40%.In 2020, we expect the mature process technology segment to remain strong, especially in image sensors and power devices. The memory segment will remain active with incremental capacity additions and technology advances, throughout the year.We currently expect memory to account for approximately 35% of revenues, in 2020. However, we are currently seeing some increased quote activity for DRAM that could materialize in the second half of the year.We still expect a more significant recovery for the overall memory segment to occur in 2021. The industry is beginning what will likely be an extended growth cycle driven by the new communication capabilities of 5G technology.The 5G infrastructure build has begun. And will accelerate in 2020. As the infrastructure expands, new 5G-capable phones and other devices will drive a strong memory cycle beginning in 2021.Following this and beginning in 2022, there will be another cycle of industrial IoT applications, even bigger than the last, which will drive strong growth in the mature process technology segment.As a result of our market segmentation approach and focused Purion product family offerings, Axcelis is extremely well positioned for strong growth, during the upcoming 5G driven cycle.Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin, to discuss our financials.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. Our Q4 financial results finished strong with revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share were well above company guidance and consensus estimates.Based on our full year 2019 results, this marked the first time Axcelis has remained profitable, through a full industry cycle. We have now achieved over five years of consecutive quarterly profits, while making investments that put the company in a stronger competitive position, as we enter what should be an extended growth period.Through the introduction of new Purion product extensions and continuous cost-out activity, we improved our gross margin year-over-year making this the second consecutive year, with gross margin greater than 40%.Additionally, we maintained a strong balance sheet, free of debt and instituted a share repurchase program. To align with our market segment strategies, we updated our $550 million revenue model, which we believe is achievable over the next two years, based on a strong memory cycle.We also added a new $650 million model, which should be achievable in four to five years. Both models reflect stronger gross margin performance, lower operating expense as a percent of revenue and significant increases in operating profit and free cash flow.I'll turn to the fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. Q4 revenue finished at $107.7 million, well above our guidance, compared to $69.5 million in Q3. Q4 system sales were $71.4 million, compared to $36.8 million in Q3. Q4 CS&I revenue finished at $36.3 million, compared to $32.6 million in Q3 driven by improving fab utilization and upgrade sales.Full year 2019 revenue was $343 million, compared to $442.6 million in 2018. Systems revenue was $202.6 million, compared to $280.4 million in 2018. CS&I revenue was $140.4 million, compared to $162.2 million in 2018. Q4 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for 85.5% of our total sales, compared to 81.5% in Q3. Four customers were at 10% or above, compared to two customers in Q3.Q4 system bookings were $77.2 million, compared to $80.2 million in Q3 with a Q4 book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 versus 2.22 in Q3. Backlog in Q4 including deferred revenue finished at $99.3 million, compared to $93.4 million in Q3. Q4 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $31.1 million or 28.9% of revenue, compared to $28.7 million or 41.3% in Q3.SG&A in the quarter was $17.5 million with R&D at $13.6 million. In Q1, we expect SG&A and R&D spending to be approximately $33 million to run slightly above this level through the remainder of 2020 driven by an increase in the evaluation tool spending and the investment in our products.We're also investing in IT infrastructure and will see a higher variable and incentive compensation costs in 2020. This level of investment in our business and products is required to achieve our $550 million and $650 million revenue models. Q4 gross margin was 41.1% and above guidance. Q4 gross margin was driven by product mix, increasing CS&I revenue and continued cost-out activity. Full year gross margin was 42%, compared to 40.6% in 2018.We're guiding Q1 gross margin of approximately 37% resulting from a less favorable mix and the expected closure of three Purion evaluation systems including our first Purion Dragon. Without the eval closures, gross margins will be about three points higher for the quarter. We expect gross margin to return to above 40% on a quarterly and full year basis. What remains key is that we continue to have solid execution on our gross margin improvement initiatives. Since the introduction of the full Purion product line, we've improved system standard margin 2,100 basis points on a rolling four quarter average.Operating profit in Q4 finished at $13.2 million well above Q3 operating profit of $1.9 million. Full year operating profit was $24.2 million, compared to $60 million in 2018. We're guiding Q1 operating profit of approximately $9.5 million. Q4 net income was $9.7 million or $0.29 per share and above guidance, compared to $0.7 million or $0.02 per share in Q3. Full year net income was $17 million or $0.50 per share, compared to $45.9 million or $1.35 per share in 2018.We are guiding Q1 earnings per share of approximately $0.21. Our Q1 guidance reflects our current assessment with the potential impact on our business from the coronavirus. As you know this continues to be a rapidly changing situation, which we're closely monitoring. If you turn to Q4 results inventory ended at $140.4 million, compared to $138.4 million in Q3. Q4 inventory turns excluding evaluation tools finished at 2, compared to 1.2 in Q3 driven by the upturn of business.Q4 accounts payable were $25.3 million, compared to $21.3 million in Q3. Q4 receivables were $83.8 million, compared to $49 million in Q3. Higher revenue and late-in-the-quarter shipments drove the significant increase in receivables.Q4 cash finished at $146.5 million compared to $162.2 million in Q3. Cash in the quarter was lower due to the spike in accounts receivable and $3.7 million spent on share repurchases. For 2020, we have put in place a 10b5-1 plan to implement our current $50 million share repurchase program.In Q4, we continued to make solid progress on gross margin improvement roadmaps. The four new Purion product line extensions combined with work on our cost-out initiatives are expected to fuel higher gross margin as we drive towards our $550 million and $650 million business models. These models can be found in our investor presentation on the company website. Thank you.I'll now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance and excited by the expectation of an extended upturn driven by innovations enabled by 5G technologies. Through continued partnership with customers and collaborations with our peers, Axcelis will offer a steady stream of Purion innovation that will support the 5G-enabled world. We believe this will drive us to a leadership position in Ion implant benefiting shareholders, customers and employees alike.To reiterate the statement I made to open our Investor Day in September, Axcelis is uniquely positioned with the capability, DNA and unwavering focus to solve customers' high-value high-impact Ion implant challenges.With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Daniel?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much, and congrats on a nice quarter and to the year. Mary, maybe first off in terms of the mature technology node opportunities still ahead in 2020. Do you see that as being more broad based this year, or is it going to be concentrated with a few customers given some of the fab projects out there?
Mary Puma: Okay. What we're seeing right now Patrick is that it's going to be broad based in terms of number of customers as well as geographies. As we said we expect for the segment to continue to remain strong through 2020 particularly with a focus on power devices and image sensors.
Patrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question in terms of the new products you discussed at your Analyst Day last year and the extensions you mentioned some are obviously a customer site evaluation and some are still within your headquarters right now. Is 2021 where we're going to see those extension products I guess hit high volume, or could they occur some time in the second half of this year?
Mary Puma: Well we're -- for some of those products we are going to see repeat orders come through this year. But I think you're right the majority of -- our expectation is that the majority of additional orders we'll get for those products will come next year 2021.
Kevin Brewer: Yes just to add to that Patrick we have a step-up in evaluation tool spending this year that's driving some of those placements.
Mary Puma: Right, and that will be again a future's look into 2021 where we'll see some repeat orders from those.
Kevin Brewer: Yes.
Patrick Ho: Great. And maybe my final question for you, Kevin specifically with these new products and the impact to gross margins. You did mention obviously the evaluation use typically have lower gross margins. So I understand that on the model. But you also said longer term they'll have higher gross margins. How quickly can you get them I guess get gross margins higher once they start volume ramping to customers? Is it going to take some time as it usually does, or is there a quicker step up to get to those higher gross margins?
Kevin Brewer: Well, there's definitely a quicker step-up with the product extensions and the typical new products release. And I think we're still very comfortable with our $550 million model with gross margins in that 42% to 43% range. So as we ramp towards that we'll continue to see the margins improve. We're getting off to a little bit of a slow start in Q1, but I think even with that for the full year we're going to be above 40% and I expect to see the follow-on quarters beyond Q1 above that 40% mark as well. So we're very optimistic about the product extensions driving margin improvement and we're continuing to work the cost out. That's become something we never let up on. So volume definitely is going to help us.
Patrick Ho: Thanks a lot guys.
Mary Puma: Got you
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Peter Peng: This is Peter Peng calling for Craig Ellis. Thanks for taking the question. First off is just on the DRAM color. Is the expectation NAND followed by DRAM, or do you kind of see DRAM pulling in versus NAND? Just wanted to get color on that?
Doug Lawson: Yes. So for us in the implant side of that market as Mary said, we're seeing it kind of split, with NAND it's incremental adds in capacity to some technology. And then DRAM, it's incremental adds and the shrinks. And so from an implant perspective, we're sort of seeing both.We expect NAND to continue through the year. And as was mentioned in the script, we're starting to see an increased level of activity -- quote activity for DRAM projects which could materialize at the end of the year. But we're really expecting 2021 to be the time when it all comes together for both.
Peter Peng: Got it. And just off of 1Q it seems like the memory and foundry logic is pretty split. Is that kind of the expectation throughout calendar 2020, or is memory going to ease off? And how should I kind of think about the profile and mix of calender 2020?
Doug Lawson: So we are still currently expecting memory to be lower in the 35% of our systems this year. As we said with the quote activity increasing in DRAM that could change in subsequent quarters, but for now we see it lower.We do see increased activity in the mature markets a lot of activity in image sensors, a lot of activity in the mature foundry logic space, just in general. So that will continue to drive that piece of the business up.
Peter Peng: Got it. And one final question. On the service line, nice to see a quarter-on-quarter rise. Is that line item more stable throughout the calendar 2020, or do you see kind of a increase year-over-year?
Kevin Brewer: Well we're starting to see the fab capacity start to come up. So utilization is improving. So that will obviously drive that as well as all the new tools that we plan to ship. So we've been on a run rate higher than that. I think if you go back probably a little over a year we've had some quarters that were closer to $40 million. So I would expect the same strength and the debt line should continue to improve.
Peter Peng: Great, thank you, guys. Congratulations on strong result.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Christian Schwab: Great, thanks. Fantastic quarter, guys. As we -- Kevin did I hear you say that you expect to be approaching or at your $550 million target model in 2021, or did I not hear that right?
Kevin Brewer: Yes within the next two years.
Christian Schwab: Within the next -- okay perfect. And then when we get to the '21...
Kevin Brewer: From a run rate -- Christian from a run rate point of view we could definitely be there in 2021. I just -- it's too early to say what the year is going to look like but...
Mary Puma: And we also predicated on a memory recovery.
Kevin Brewer: Yes it does...
Mary Puma: In -- later this year in 2021 which is more likely.
Kevin Brewer: Yes.
Christian Schwab: Right. And that was my next question. Thank you. Is -- how do you guys see that significant memory recovery taking place in 2021? Is that going to be very DRAM specific or a combination of Flash and DRAM?
Doug Lawson: Right now we see it as a combination, Christian. It's really -- we'll start to see the 5G phones towards the end of this year, having more impact and that's driving higher DRAM as well as some higher NAND. And then of course, the cloud and the general storage platform is driving for NAND. So we see 2021 as being sort of the next big cycle from a memory perspective, where there's significant fab expansion and new capacity.
Christian Schwab: Okay, great. Fabulous. No other questions. Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks.
Mary Puma: Next question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Tom Diffely: Yeah, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up question on memory. What is your relative exposure to the DRAM market versus the NAND market? Because we're seeing a lot of companies talk more about a NAND recovery this year than DRAM and yet you still have a little more exposure looks like on the DRAM side?
Doug Lawson: Yes. So in terms of -- if it's new wafer starts or new capacity that's added we're -- it's pretty equal. It's a different product mix for us. NAND will see more high energy. And in DRAM we'll see more high current. So a slightly different product mix, but similar opportunity when there's a full cycle of big capacity adds. When we're in the situation where we're in kind of in 2020 where there's layer additions we don't participate in the layer additions. That's where the dep and etch processes participate. But oftentimes, there are some additional implants that go into the next node and definitely into any new capacity that's added. And so that's how we participate there. And again, it's a little more high energy for us. NAND we participate both in the technology shrink, which usually requires some new and more difficult implants and as well as in the capacity side.
Tom Diffely: Okay. That's helpful. And then Mary I might have missed on your comments about the coronavirus. Did you quantify that at all, or how much that's impacting your outlook for the first quarter?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So Tom what we said is we've put into our guidance what we feel the impact is at this point in time and that we're continuing to monitor it because it is -- as you know it's a changing event kind of daily. But at this point, our guidance assumes any known impact from the virus.
Tom Diffely: Okay. And for you does that impact your systems business CSI, or is it more on the manufacturing side?
Kevin Brewer: It would be across-the-board impact. I mean a lot of it has to do with -- in terms of shipments getting shipments into certain areas and then trying to get parts out. But now at this point we haven't -- I would say we haven't seen a major impact from it. And again, we've assessed where we are at this point and have included that into our guidance.
Tom Diffely: Okay. Thanks. And then finally Kevin, when you look at the margin progression you're expecting over the next year or so are all four of the new tools nice accretive margin structures, or is there a difference between the four products from a margin point of view?
Kevin Brewer: So the products that we released back in September they're all very good margins. And I would say accretive for the most part to where we are today, especially on an average they definitely accretive to the average systems margins we have right now.
Tom Diffely: Okay. Thank you for your time.
Doug Lawson: In general, Tom when we look at the segmented markets and we look at designing products specifically pyramid sensors and for power devices and for certain challenging implants there's higher value to be had for the customer and that's reflected in pricing and margin.
Tom Diffely: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Duley with Steelhead. Your line is now open.
David Duley: Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on nice results. Just as far as the evaluation systems go, could you just kind of walk us through the accounting impact of those. I guess I understand the margin impact was there a revenue impact? And how exactly are you accounting for these?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So there's a margin impact because the costs are typically higher on these tools. As we have them in the field, we're making changes to them and that goes against the gross margins. Sometimes the pricing is in the lower end on an eval tool. So that's a margin impact. There is -- also on the operating expense side, there's a lot of support from engineering and selling that go into these tools. So that increases your OpEx as well. So those are really the two areas David. It kind of hits us on both sides.
Doug Lawson: And then -- and the only other place is they do stay on our balance sheet as inventory until they're converted.
Kevin Brewer: Yes, right. That is a good point. So our inventory they're considered our assets until we convert the PO at the end of the eval cycle.
David Duley: Okay. And are there more of the evaluation systems to come during the year?
Mary Puma: So we have one evaluation system outstanding today, it is at a memory customer. But, yes, I mean, as Kevin mentioned, our evaluation budget for the year is up. So we fully expect to place multiple evaluation units across multiple segments, across all of the segments during the year.
Kevin Brewer: Our year-over-year eval budget is up measurably.
David Duley: And when -- I realize it's difficult to judge, but when do you expect these evaluation systems to produce repeat orders?
Doug Lawson: Well. So the evaluations that are in the field and expected to close in this quarter, we would have opportunity at that point for follow-on orders as the customer ramps that particular process or that capacity. So in the case of the Dragon that's in DRAM and NAND as that gets some capacity adds for those processes, then we would have opportunity.That could be follow-on orders in 2020. We definitely would expect higher volumes as we go into 2021, as the memory market recovers more fully. As far as the products like the XEmax and H200 that are more segment focused, those go to -- tend to go to a broad base of customers. And so, we would expect follow-ons there as they ramp that particular process flow. Again, that could happen fairly quickly or a little bit later depending on their needs.
Mary Puma: Right. Even potentially before the evaluation closes.
Doug Lawson: Right.
David Duley: Okay. And final question for me is, you've always had one of the best implanters for the CMOS image sensors. And you look at the number of cameras per phone and it's up pretty nicely going versus historically. How big can the CMOS image sensor business be for you guys as far as a market opportunity, or any way you can characterize it and I would expect -- would you expect there to be significant growth this year versus last year in that segment?
Doug Lawson: So, it's a little bit difficult for us to measure the market exactly, because some of the implanters that we sell into that market are going to a general-purpose foundry where they might use it for other things. But as a whole, you're absolutely right Dave. The market is growing pretty significantly.Implant is a very key enabler for some of the more advanced technologies, whether it's higher pixel count or BPV, deep IR and reds. And so, products like the XEmax and the VXE really enable our customers to do things there. And for us, they're much higher-priced systems than a standard high energy tool. And so that grows the market in terms of revenue, additionally beyond units.And I think the last thing -- comment on that is, many of these image sensors are sent out to different foundries. And so most foundries want that business and for them to be able to have that business, they really need to put the best implanter in place. And so, the implanter are -- we might start with an evaluation at a key foundry or key IDM that's doing image sensors and it will quickly roll out like the VXE did to many of the other foundries so that they have that capability.
David Duley: Okay. I said it was last question, but I had one more. Just on the virus. There are a couple of memory fabs in the ground-zero of this thing, have you been able to ship units into those factories, or could you just talk about what some of the logistics are to get tools into those locations, if they are active at this point?
Mary Puma: So at this point, Dave, we can't comment on specific customer shipment. We could talk about China. We're not going to talk about specific provinces in China or specific customers. So, I think, we'll just keep it where we left it. Both Kevin and I said that, we're monitoring it very closely. We factored what we know today into our Q1 guidance and we'll just continue to watch it and take appropriate actions.
David Duley: Thank you.
Doug Lawson: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.
Mark Miller: You're guiding to 50% memory content in the first quarter yet 35% for the year. I was just wondering in terms of your thinking Intel and some others have come out and expressed some caution about data center spending being cyclically slowing second half of the year. Is this part of your thinking in terms of your projections for memory this year versus 2021?
Doug Lawson: Well, in general what we've seen from a memory perspective for this year, Mark is there's not one gigantic driver. There is a lot of little things right? There's Window 7 retirement. There is the initial 5G phones that we'll start to see more of towards the end of the year. So there's a bunch of smaller things.There's the initial 5G infrastructure, which is driving some memory and so there's not that one big thing. We expect that to really start to happen in 2021 when all of those factors are starting to come together and it will drive the volume of both DRAM and NAND, so for this year, we see a little bit of a pickup in this quarter. As we said, we're seeing a higher quote activity for DRAM could materialize in the second half. But for right now we're staying at 35% in terms of what we expect the mix to be for memory.
Mark Miller: And what are you seeing you're getting much business from the domestic Chinese. Has that starting to ramp? I mean Yangtze Memory has an aggressive ramp. Just was wondering if you're playing into that opportunity?
Mary Puma: It is. We have -- we talked about how typically -- or the majority of our business in China was from some of the global multinationals. But at this point in time we are seeing a mix with the domestic Chinese customers and we expect that to continue throughout the year.
Mark Miller: And finally service margins were negative it looks like, I mean what -- was there some added cost for services? It kind of spiked up this quarter in terms of service cost?
Kevin Brewer: Well, so CS&I as a whole -- it is very accretive. That's spare parts and upgrades and used tools. And the -- you must be looking at the SEC document. That breaks out just the labor piece Mark. And that runs very low margins anywhere from negative to single digits. But in general, our service business when you look at it in entirety it's very healthy. And overall margins are still very accretive to the business.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Doug Lawson: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gus Richard with Northland. Your line is now open.
Gus Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations, good quarter. Just on the Q4, can you give us a split on the mature, how much of that was image sensors or foundry logic et cetera?
Mary Puma: So we don't get down into the specific market segments, but we said 61% of our shipments were mature process technology, 46% of that was what we would categorize as foundry business and the other 15% was logic.
Gus Richard: Okay. And then in terms of Q1, just trying to quantify the risk going forward. Do you have a sense of what you expect your regional mix to be?
Mary Puma: At this point, we're not going to disclose that. I will say as it -- typically is it's very Asia focused. But it will be a mix from all the usual suspects in terms of the countries that we ship to.
Gus Richard: Got it. And then a housekeeping question. I didn't catch the booking number on the quarter. What was that?
Kevin Brewer: Bookings was $77.2 million.
Gus Richard: Got it. Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, Gus.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi guys. Congratulations on the nice results. I wanted to just ask seems like many of your WFE peers have talked about the foundry logic business in 2020 being front-end loaded, but I think those comments really pertain to be advanced foundry logic space. Given that most of your foundry logic is tied to the mature nodes, how do you see the profile first half versus second half in the mature specialty foundry logic segment? Is that flatter, or is it back-half loaded, or do you think it may also be front-half loaded?
Doug Lawson: It's pretty steady. It's driven by a very broad base of customers and a pretty broad mix of products and new devices. From an implant perspective, the mature markets are actually great because, implanters worry more about the individual devices running in these foundries versus just processing wafers. And so, the bigger the product mix and the broader the customer base, the better the implant opportunity is in the mature markets. So, we see it as good solid business throughout the year. And so...
Quinn Bolton: And then I wanted to follow-up on some of the evals that you closed this quarter or will close in the March quarter, specifically Dragon. We've all seen I think in past cycles when memory turns on, it can turn on in a hurry. And I guess my question is, to the extent that some of that DRAM activity that you're starting to see quotes for, if that pulls more into the second half of 2020. First, can you get the Dragon system up and produce to meet that accelerated time schedule? And if you can meet that time schedule, would it have an impact on margins, or do you think you could ramp margins on an accelerated shipment schedule if that scenario plays out? Thanks.
Mary Puma: All right. So I'll start with the -- sort of the business side of it and then Kevin can talk about the margins. Yes, we expect to get follow-on orders from the evals. There were three evals we closed, all memory evals, two are high current. One was high energy. One of those high currents with the Purion Dragon and we fully expect to get additional follow-on orders for that in 2020.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. I think from a higher volume point of view, Dragon will be more of a 2021. I think a lot of the business we gained this year in high current will be with the existing high current tools we have. But as Mary said, as these evals close, we expect to see follow-on with the Dragon tools in those areas.
Doug Lawson: And I guess the last part of your question Quinn. Do we have the ability to ramp the product quickly? And the answer to that is, yes. So, keep in mind that, we have a lot of commonality with the Purion platform and the end station and so forth. And so, we do have the ability to ramp the product quickly.
Quinn Bolton: But it sounds like from Mary's comments that the Dragon is probably -- even if you see some of these projects start to accelerate that Dragon is still probably more of a 2021 volume ramp. So, I just want to make sure I got the right sort of expectation.
Mary Puma: Yes.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. And then lastly around -- sorry go ahead.
Doug Lawson: I was just going to say and that's really in line with how we see the memory market playing out, where the real volume ramp is 2021. And that aligns well with Kevin's comments in terms of our road map up to the $550 million model. Memory is required and these new products really put us in a good position to get to that 42% to 43% in that model.
Quinn Bolton: Great. And then just wanted to -- a final question on Dragon, but you'll close the first eval tool. Can you give us any update on how you think or what the opportunity is to place eval tools on the advanced logic side for Dragon, or do you think most of those evals for Dragon going forward stay on the DRAM or NAND side?
Mary Puma: Well, I mean we continue -- we've talked about this many times. We continue to work with -- there are now four customers really or five who are working at advanced nodes for logic and we're working with all of them. So, at some point, we continue -- we expect to penetrate into that market segment, but we're not going to make any specific comments about which products and what the timing on that is. We'll just continue to work at it.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. Thank you.
Doug Lawson: Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, Quinn.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Daniel. We want to thank all of you for listening to our call and we hope you can join us for Susquehanna's 9th Annual Technology Conference on March 12 in New York City. We thank you for your continued support.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you, for participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[0.14940067122993272, 0.0828204977064686];0.0828204977064686;0.14940067122993272;1
28;ACLS;2020-05-06;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company's Results for the First Quarter of 2020. My name is Julie and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Julie. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy.We are all participating in this call remotely, so I would like to apologize in advance for any technical difficulties. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release.Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor provision.These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K, annual report, and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.I hope you and your families are healthy during this difficult period. At Axcelis, we are carefully managing through this unprecedented global situation. But I would like to emphasize that we remain laser-focused on the strategic objectives we outlined at our Investor Day in September.During the first quarter, we achieved two key milestones along the path to market leadership in Ion implantation and to our long-term business model. First, we received our first Purion order from Japan. Second, we closed the first Purion Dragon evaluation and received a follow on order.The dedication of our employees has made these significant accomplishments possible, and our top priority is ensuring their health and safety, while continuing to serve our customers.I would personally like to give a heartfelt thank you to our extraordinary employees in the factory, global field locations and those at home in the U.S. and around the world who are working diligently to meet our customer commitments. I also want to thank our suppliers and end customers for their support as we strive to meet the continuing high level of customer interest in our Purion products.Our first quarter financial performance was very strong. Revenue for the first quarter was $119 million. Earnings per share of $0.33 was well above guidance and consensus.During the first quarter, memory accounted for 52% of our shipments, 31% DRAM and 21% NAND. Mature foundry logic customers accounted for the remaining 48%. The geographic mix of our shipment our system shipments in the first quarter was China 38%, Korea 34%, Taiwan 20%, and the U.S. and Europe, 8%.While the COVID-19 pandemic has generated uncertainty and new challenges for 2020, it is important to understand that the semiconductor industry is critical in today's world and remains fundamentally strong.Near-term, we will be required to manage our business on a day-to-day basis relative to uncontrollable pandemic-driven hurdles associated with global government policies, the impact on world economies, and the reactions of our customers and suppliers. The industry is just exiting a down cycle, a period of lower capacity investment.As a result, we can still expect to see investment in both technology and capacity for critical market segments. Axcelis has done significant work to understand our customers' market segments and to develop products that provide a competitive advantage. We expect to see the individual market segments react differently to COVID-19 challenges.Currently, semiconductor products required for working from home and sheltering in place are in high demand. This includes products for PCs, video streaming, and communications. At the same time, demand for products related to automotive and aviation, for example, have slowed.Our knowledge and expertise allow us to work closely with our customers across these market segments even during this difficult time, to provide them with the best Ion implant solutions for their specific manufacturing challenges.We are well-positioned as a result of investment in new Purion products during the down cycle and by the broad and highly diverse Purion customer base we have developed over the last several years.In the first quarter, we closed three evaluations, all for new memory applications. One of these evaluations was for the first Purion Dragon at a NAND customer. This is our newest and most technologically advanced high current implanter. We also received the first Purion Dragon follow-on order and shipped that tool in the first quarter as well.The interest level is also very high for two of our other new Purion systems, the Purion XEmax, a high energy tool designed for the most advanced image sensor applications and for the Purion H200, which is focused on the power device market. We also announced our first Purion order in Japan, a Purion XE for a power device customer.It is easy during this difficult time to forget that the industry is beginning what will likely be an extended growth cycle, driven by the new communications capability of 5G technology. We still believe the 5G infrastructure build has begun and will accelerate in 2020 and into 2021. As the infrastructure expands, new 5G-capable phones and other devices will drive a strong memory cycle beginning in 2021.Following this and beginning in 2022, there will be another cycle of industrial IoT applications even bigger than the last, which will drive strong growth in the mature process technology segment. One thing that emerges very clearly from this pandemic is that communication requirements and the technology to support them are more critical than ever and that Axcelis is extremely well positioned for strong growth during the upcoming 5G driven cycle.Now I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials and some operational details.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Before I provide an update on our very strong first quarter performance, I'd like to take a minute to discuss some of the actions we are taking to respond to the current pandemic situation.I'll start by saying that all areas of our business remain operational due to the extraordinary effort of our employees, suppliers and continuing customer demand for our products. During this time, the health and well-being of our employees remains a top priority, and we are doing our best to create a safe work environment for all Axcelis employees. For those who must work in our factory, we have implemented safeguards like physical distancing and have required a use of masks. Everyone who can work from home is working from home.Field-based teams are continuing to support our customers, while following both government and customer required safety protocols. Mary did not provide guidance for the quarter, as she normally would. The pandemic and potential economic impact has limited our visibility. It could potentially put uncontrollable challenges in our path. As a result, we will not be providing formal guidance.However, I will highlight that Q1 bookings and backlog finished at record levels, indicating the current strength and demand for Axcelis products and services. Flotation activity continues to be strong and customer discussions remain very active. Based on our current orders, Q2 revenue could be similar to Q1. But the many unknowns, including potential supply chain disruption creates greater than normal uncertainty around our Q2 results.Now turning to the first quarter results. Q1 revenue finished at $119 million, well above our guidance compared to $107.7 million in Q4. Q1 system sales were $82.3 million compared to $71.4 million in Q4. Q1 CS&I revenue finished at $36.7 million compared to $36.3 million in Q4. Q1 sales of our top 10 customers accounted for 85.9% of our total sales compared to 85.5% in Q4. Four customers were at 10% or above the same as in Q4.Q1 system bookings were $115.1 million compared to $77.2 million in Q4 with a Q1 book-to-bill ratio of 1.37 versus 1.06 in Q4. Backlog in Q1, including deferred revenue, finished at $127 million compared to $99.3 million in Q4. Q1 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $31.8 million and below our guidance of approximately $33 million due to timing of expenses. For the quarter, operating expenses were 28 -- 26.8% of revenue compared to $31.1 million or 28.9% in Q4.SG&A in the quarter was $17.2 million with R&D at $14.6 million. Q1 gross margin was 38.38% and above guidance compared to 41.1% in Q4. Q1 gross margin is lower than normal due to the closure of three evaluation tools, including the first Purion Dragon. Although, we are not providing formal Q2 guidance, we still expect full year gross margin to be greater than 40%, and we remain on track to achieve our gross margin targets in our $550 million and $650 million target models. Operating profit in Q1 finished at $13.7 million compared to Q4 operating profit of 13.2%. Q1 net income was $11.2 million or $0.33 per share and above guidance compared to $9.7 million or $0.29 per share in Q4.Inventory ended at $136.1 million compared to $140.4 million in Q4. Q1 inventory turns, excluding evaluation tools, finished at 2.2 compared to 2.0 in Q4. Q1 accounts payable were $26.1 million compared to $25.3 million in Q4. Q1 receivables were $64.2 million compared to $83.8 million in Q4. Q1 cash finished at $181.4 million compared to $146.5 million in Q4. Cash from operations in the quarter was $39.7 million.In the quarter, we repurchased $7.5 million of our common stock, but have suspended a repurchase program. We will maintain a conservative cash investment strategy while continuing to invest in the business during these uncertain times.Axcelis entered 2020 with great momentum. While the pandemic has shown us some near-term challenges, we have not lost focus on achieving our $550 million and $650 million target models. Our customers continue to have high expectations for our Purion products, which we intend to achieve.I hope that all of you and your families are well during this challenging times. I will now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. We are pleased with our excellent first quarter performance and remain focused on executing well for the rest of the year. Axcelis has a competitive Purion product line, a broad and diverse customer base, a strong balance sheet and a dedicated team of employees. We are counting on these strengths to pull us through this difficult period and result in market leadership in Ion implantation.And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Julie?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Congrats on a nice quarter and glad to hear everyone is well. Maybe Kevin, to start off, can you discuss any impact from COVID-19 on the gross margin profile? Whether there were any cost, whether it was on the supply chain, logistics or even manufacturing utilization? And how much of an impact it had in Q1? And did you see anything for Q2?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. So let me start off by just putting a little framework around operating expenses. So we are seeing some impact from the coronavirus is hitting us in a couple of places. It's in freight, it's in supplies, because we are supplying that to people so addition of cleaning in the factories. There's other – there are some inefficiencies within the factory. We want the social distancing.We've had to move workspaces out. So we're working around that. And if you ask me for a number right now, it's probably in the order of $1 million to as high as $1.5 million for Q2, Q3, at this point in time, and that's spread, Patrick, across the OpEx line and the gross margin.If I look at my Q2 expenses, and based on the revenue we're currently achieved, which is similar to Q1, operating expenses are going to creep up to about a $35 million when you put everything in there that we need to go do, both in terms of investing in the new products because we're not slowing down in our investments. We're not slowing down on tool that we plan to put in the field.So there is some impact at this point in time. I'm thinking that it's – if this – as I look at it right now, it's a Q2, Q3 type of event. I'm assuming in Q4 that we're – it's more of a back to normal type situation. But just talking at freight a little bit. I know you're well aware of it and everybody probably is.I mean, it's very difficult right now to get freight forwarders and carriers to bring material in and out consolidated shipments pretty much have ended. So I think that is one area where along with probably a lot of our peers are seeing some impact from freight cost. And that predominantly flushes into gross margin, but there is a piece of that, that does go into the OpEx. So that's probably across all the buckets.
Patrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And maybe, Kevin, as a follow-up to that question, sticking on the balance sheet and your working capital management. Obviously, inventory turns improved, and you mentioned the evaluation system going to the customers. From your internal standpoint, how do you feel about your inventory levels, given that the entire features appears to be building a little bit of buffer inventory going from your customers to their end users. And even within the supply chain, how do you feel about building up some of the inventory for yourself given any potential further disruption?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So that's a good question, Patrick. So, everybody wants to get in line to make sure they're getting it parked. So, we're probably doing the same thing that, again, our peer group are doing. We've looked at our MRP lead time offsets right now. We've adjusted a little bit the material earlier. We're also looking at the long lead items, and we're driving some extra material for the long lead items. So, we're trying to stay ahead of this because the supply chain has been a day-by-day event. We've watched it move around the world from starting in Asia, in Europe, in California.And so the only thing we can do right now is to try to stay ahead of it. And again, we're driving material a little bit ahead. And you can see almost a similar thing, too, even in our -- we had a strong service CS&I revenue in Q1. And you can see some regions even spare parts with customers are trying to pull ahead a little bit. So, it's a game that I think everybody is right now. So yes, we're trying to stay ahead of it.
Patrick Ho: Great. And final question for me and maybe for Mary, in terms of the market environment, March saw pretty healthy level of revenues from China. Can you give a little bit of color on that business? Was it primarily domestic? And maybe a little color between the mix between foundry and mix?
Mary Puma: Okay. So, China is obviously a very important region for Axcelis. It runs approximately 30% of our revenues in any given quarter. Right now, China continues to be very active. And we're seeing that primarily in the mature process technology segment with the domestic Chinese manufacturers. Even though a significant portion of our business in China typically comes from the global semiconductor companies right now, there is quite a bit of activity from the domestic customers. And I would say that activity is a mix really across all segments. We're seeing not only the mature process technology, but we are seeing demand coming from some of the memory customers.And I would say the image sensors, also continues to be a very active segment for us. So, we continue to watch for that. We are prepared. We have teams in place to accept the shipments and do the installations and those are all things that we're watching. So, right now, we're very happy that, that's an active region, and we're prepared to serve it.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you, very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good execution in the first quarter. Kevin, I wanted to start with -- I wanted to start with some clarifications. One, there was an unusually large number of evaluation tools in the quarter. But if we set that aside and we just looked at Purion system margin performance and cost reduction, would the business have stayed on that nice Purion upward trend that we see in the investor deck, where there are different things going on with COVID adjustments that would have precluded ongoing margin expansion?.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So, the biggest impact on Q1 was that -- if I look at what that contributed, Craig, it was about 300 basis points of negative gross margin. So, if you add that back, and you can see exactly where we would have been. There are some things flowing through the gross margin line, but they haven't really hit yet because a lot of basically how we do the buildup on the expenses and capitalized variances and bring it back through future point in time. Most of that starts to hit in the Q2, Q3 area. So, Q1 was really all about the eval tools and like it was about 300 basis points of negative impact.In terms of the cost out activity, we're still right on point of our road maps. I think you're well aware of it, and we've been talking about for a while that we've got many things we're doing with both the supply chain and continue to do in a factory with lean events and the coronavirus has not impacted that. Even though a lot of folks are working from home, we're keeping up with everything. Engineers are keeping up with things, purchasing keeping up and all the support groups.At this point in time, the people in the factory are the direct labor people manufacturing, some supervision and some support. But the good news is everybody else working from home is keeping up. So, everything we wanted to do with our road maps, we're still on track. And I'm still very comfortable with the margin targets we have in both the $550 million and $650 million our target models.
Craig Ellis: Very good and certainly a significant accomplishment in this environment. Just further clarifying that point. Is it reasonable to think that there's one-ish evaluation tools per quarter, or would they be above or below that? Not looking for specific guidance, but just some color on what you see in the funnel.
Kevin Brewer: So I'll tell you, there's many more evals going out this year than what we disclosed in Q1. So there's plenty of evals in there, and that's part of the investment, because a big chunk of that hits the OpEx line. But when I talk about still seeing full year gross margins average greater than 40%, I've got that accounted for it, Craig. So even though we've got a fair number of evals coming out of, this was an unusually the cards are stacked against us in this quarter. We had three evals closed. We also had a very fine mix of high current. And you can see from our investor presentation. Unfortunately, is still at a lower margin, but it's continuing to get better.So we -- like I said, we had a few things stacked against us this quarter. But going forward, I still expect even with this start at 38.3, that our full year average is still going to be above 40 based on what I'm looking for the Q2, Q3, Q4.
Craig Ellis: That’s great.
Doug Lawson: Craig, just wanted to add one thing relative to expectations for future evals. The new products, the Purion XEmax, the Purion H200, Dragon and so forth, those are key targets for evals over the course of this year. So that's really part of the growth towards the 550, and especially towards the 650 model is getting those products seeded.
Craig Ellis: Absolutely. Thanks, Doug. Mary, I wanted to see if we could get some color just on what you're seeing with the bookings and backlog strength for the first quarter, what that might mean for the mix of business in the second quarter? I know there's not specific guidance given the uncertainty, but any color on how some of the key segments might trend mature foundry? And then within memory, any DRAM and added color?
Mary Puma: Okay. So I can tell you what the bookings look like for the first quarter. We have said that bookings typically come in one quarter, and those tools are typically shipped in the same quarter. But I can give you some color around it. So the bookings for Q1, it was actually 50/50 split between mature process technology and memory. And also, that split was pretty even in memory between DRAM and NAND. So that will give you a sense.And we mentioned on our last call that we believe that memory spending has picked up. It started for us in Q4. And in Q1, we talked about how approximately 50% of our shipments were for memory. And we are seeing strength in memory going into Q2 as well. Given the fact that we have all the COVID-19 activity going on, it's hard to assess the potential impact that that will have on any specific segment going forward, particularly memory. But we still expect the memory spending to increase in 2021 and 2022.We mentioned that automotive has been impacted, which obviously has an impact for us or a negative impact on power devices. So we've seen a little bit of slowdown in some of the mature process technology areas where customers are specifically focused on automotive.But other than that, demand really continues to be strong. And we attribute that not only to having a strong Purion product line, but having that large diverse customer base is positive. And so we think that while there may be some fluctuations, some downward fluctuations in some market segments, we think that there will be a positive impact in other market segments, and we're hoping that that will provide somewhat of a buffer for us moving forward. But demand, in general, continues to be strong.
Craig Ellis: That's really helpful. And Mary, I know you spend a lot of time just out meeting with customers. I'm wondering, if you could help us with any color just beyond the second quarter as it relates to the year's linearity. Any sense from those customer conversations if the environment is setting up for flattish linearity, potentially down given how strong things are in the first half? Thanks for any insights there.
Mary Puma: Yeah. It's really hard to tell what's going to happen moving forward. I just mentioned some of the observations that we've had based on some of the market segments. But any further color, their customers are obviously taking a hard look at what's going on right now in terms of demand from their customers. And that's the part we just don't know is what is the economic impact going to be on their business and then how that will run down or impact our business. So we continue to watch that.But as I said, right now things continue to be quite strong. And our sales teams are monitoring that on a daily basis and feeding that into us. So I think we have a pretty good handle right now on the demand for Q2, as Kevin said, but there obviously is a lot of uncertainty around some of the other factors that are going into that as he explained. So Craig, it's really hard to look much further out than that at this point and make any predictions.
Craig Ellis: Understandable. Congratulations on the performance Mary. Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum Capital.
Christian Schwab: Hi. Good morning guys. Great quarter.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks.
Christian Schwab: Just a little bit clarity -- more clarity on the cautiousness to give exact guidance on the top line for Q2. When you're looking at the supply chain issues, is the concern more movement restrictions, or is it actually fears over getting certain components, or in addition, is there any cautiousness that you could -- as the quarter goes on, see customer push-outs of the extremely strong backlog that you currently have in place. If there's any color you could provide there, that would be great.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So Christian, right now it's all around the supply chain. From a demand point of view, I'm not worried about the customer. And frankly, as a matter of fact, there's probably more customers who like to pull things in than push out at this point.It really is keeping track of the supply chain is very global. I mean, we've had been from factories that might have had a discrete outbreak with the virus where we had to have temporary shutdowns. We've got things coming out of Mexico, where factories still can't have more than 50 people per shift things like cables, for example. We've dealt with shutdowns that were in California. So the caution really is around the daily changing environment with supply chain.And again, it's -- we can certainly look at our suppliers right now and know where there's state regulations and may be slowing people down and shutting them down, but it gets back to operates, for example. And all of a sudden, you've got a critical supplier who's not delivering. So that's probably the most color I can get right now. So that's why we're being a little bit cautious, because we are on a daily basis, we're dealing with things. We have a fairly large supply chain. There's a lot of components to go on these implanters, and it only takes a couple that can stop you.
Christian Schwab: Great. That's a fabulous color. And then, Mary or Doug, as you guys -- or Mary talked about your expectations for an improved memory spending environment in 2020 and for that to continue into growth in 2021. Can you give us some color, and your guys have thoughts, the impact of growing capital intensity in each step, no change in NAND and DRAM. Is that the predominant reason for that, or do you finally believe we'll begin to see due to ongoing memory demand, the beginnings of capacity through capacity additions versus technology node transitions impacting spending? Any clarity on your guys' long-term visions on that would be fabulous?
Doug Lawson: Okay. So I think as we said in the call, the last year, memory underinvested, there's -- so there's a fair amount of activity, especially on the technology side right now and a little bit on capacity. So we would expect 2020, it continues in that manner. 2021 is really still the point where we'll start to see capacity, big capacity increases, which hasn't really changed on the grand scheme of things throughout the COVID-19 crisis.So we're seeing a lot of interest, and there's a lot of activity relative to the more difficult implant steps. Hence, there's a lot of interest in the Dragon product in those steps. There's more high energy activity in some of those -- some of the NAND steps and so forth. So I think it's probably a little more driven by technology at this point, Christian, with some capacity adds.Keep in mind, as people add layer counts, it doesn't directly impact implant in the sense that there's more implants required for the next layer count, but it does affect the capacity balance within the factory, which usually does mean they do need to rebalance and add some implant steps -- some implanters. So it's a combination for 2020 and 2021 is, I think, where we're going to really see the step-up in capacity adds.
Christian Schwab: Great. And then my last question. Congratulations on the much of the eval tool out there. Should we be watching eval tools, in particular potentially the Dragon, as kind of the leading indicator throughout this year for market share gains in 2021?
Mary Puma: Yes. I mean, we – Doug, go ahead.
Doug Lawson: Well, I guess, what I was going to say, Christian, was that the new tools are very important indicators for the model growth. The – I think one of the things we talked about at the Investor Day was how the current products, some of the products like the VXE and some of the power devices are very critical towards the 550 model, and that the newer ones dragging XEmax, Purion H200, will have some influence over the 550 model, but are very important for the 650 model. So I think it should be looking at the evals for the new products, as having much more impact on the longer-term model than nearer term, the current product set is – are the main drivers for the 550 model.
Christian Schwab: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.
Tom Diffely: Yes. Good morning. So first, I guess, a clarification for, Kevin. It sounds like if revenues are flat quarter-over-quarter, you think margin – gross margins will be up a little bit even though there are some extra costs coming from the corona – the extra cost from the coronavirus?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. Yes. Based on the cost out activity that, we're currently have in play in the Q2 mix, which does not have the three evals Q1 that we'll continue to see margin expand, throughout the year, we're going to have to continue to get better quarter-by-quarter to hit that greater than 40% for full year, which I fully expect at this point, we're going to do. And at this point, I have the impact, as I know it, baked into those gross margin assumptions. And there's – in Q2, Q3 is where, at this point, I see the majority of the impact on the business based on what I know today.
Tom Diffely: Yes. Okay. That's very helpful. And then when we look at the new products, specifically here, the Dragon, so obviously very nice to see a follow-on order and a shipment on that. But how do you see that rolling out? Does it stay with the NAND market for a while, and then ultimately you get to look from the DRAM or the logic market, or are companies looking at for all three end markets? A little color there would be great.
Doug Lawson: Okay. So, the initial customer has looked at it for both and started just based on their demand and their technology needs started on the NAND side. There's still strong interest on the DRAM side. And we'll see that roll out. And there's strong interest in the logic – advanced logic side in the product as well. So I think, Tom, we can't go into the specifics for each of the customers. But the sales team and marketing team and the customers, they have a strategy for sort of the combination of Purion agents and Dragon for each of the applications and what fits for the different recipe needs for each of the technologies. So I think you should expect to see Dragon, it's starting with NAND, wouldn't surprise me to see DRAM activity over the course of this year and certainly into next year as well.
Tom Diffely: Okay. So it's not a situation where the technology advantages on the Dragon are more evident or more suited towards NAND versus DRAM based on the structure?
Doug Lawson: Yeah. No, it's absolutely not specific demand. So all of those – all three of the advanced technologies, whether it's logic, DRAM or NAND, have similar structural things and uniformity requirements that Dragon is better at than the existing products on the market.
Tom Diffely: Great. Okay. And then finally, when you look at the penetration into the Japanese market, how big a market is that for right now?
Mary Puma: We think that Japan actually – we actually think that Japan represents about 15% of the overall $1 billion ion Implanter. So, about $150 million, we have not sold there for a number of years. Just recently broke back in and sold some legacy systems, but we're very excited because we did just receive our first for a Purion product. It was a Purion for a power device application from a Japanese customer.So, we believe now that, we have many opportunities to expand into other customers in other market segments. We are working very closely with the large Japanese customers. We're continuing to collaborate with Screen, and we have equipment in their lab. But one of the things that, we've learned over the last two years from working with Screen is that customers actually want to buy directly from Axcelis because of the highly technical sales process associated with an ion Implanter. So we have, over the last few years, been building a Japanese organization, and we're continuing to staff our own Axcelis direct team. And in fact, we recently hired a new Japanese country manager. So it's a large opportunity and we're planning to aggressively go after it.
Tom Diffely: Okay. Great. Thank you. Appreciate your color.
Doug Lawson: Tom, let me -- if I can add just one more thing. This is another one where the Japanese market is something that we think is important on this 650 model, have lesser impact on the march to the 550 model. And so it's something that we expect we'll be patient with and will take some time.
Tom Diffely: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Duley, Steelhead Securities.
David Duley: Yeah. Most of my questions have been answered, but I still have a few. I guess first question is the strength in the orders and the book-to-bill, orders were up substantially, and your book-to-bill, I guess, was 1.3. But you kind of implied that your revenues, if everything shakes out as you expect, would be flat. Could you just talk about why you would expect flat we've got surge in orders?
Kevin Brewer: Well, we're looking at this point, what we believe we can deliver on in terms of commitments. And again, what kind of gets in our way is, we don't know from day-to-day, what could happen with supply chain disruptions. So we feel at this point, it could be similar. But again, there's the day-to-day things that could be interrupted. We have a pretty strong backlog coming out order too, or I mean, the backlog, I think it's $127 million. So we can see things up going up a little bit, but that's just where we are going to be at this point in time to...
David Duley: So this quarter, you're going to ship a lot more out of the backlog rather than booking ship during the quarter, I guess, is one assumption.
Kevin Brewer: We still -- I mean, it's still a lot of quoting activity. So we -- it doesn't mean that Q2 can't be another strong bookings quarter. Quotation activity remains strong at this point. So I think the real key is that the good news so far is that we haven't seen, at least Axcelis hasn't seen a fall-off in customer demand for products. And based on the Q1 numbers, bookings and backlog, and based on the quotation activity we're still seeing, we're expecting that to continue at this point.
David Duley: Okay. So it's fair to say that any constraints you have on revenue or supply side driven rather than demand from the customers at this point?
Kevin Brewer: Absolutely for Q2, yes. Yes.
David Duley: Okay. And…
Doug Lawson: And Dave, if I could just add on that. When you get into the segmented markets and some of the specialty markets and so forth and the mature process technologies, those guys do plan out a little bit longer in terms of POs and so forth. So some bookings are not necessarily in the same quarter alone when -- in some of these markets versus the memory, which is -- tends to be much more book and ship very close together.
David Duley: Okay. And then as far as Chinese revenue goes, they kind of went into the pandemic first, and then, I guess, they were one of the first geographic agents to come out. And I realize you have a lot of exposure to China. But are you seeing the domestic Chinese guys activity improve substantially as their economy improves? And do you think that, that can be a good guide for what we might expect when the U.S. and European gets to the same point in the curve?
Mary Puma: So Dave, I don't actually think we saw a significant change in demand from China, even during the first quarter, while they were going through the height of the pandemic. They did a pretty good job of keeping things going, I would say, for the most part. The fabs continue to run. We continue to service the equipment in those fabs. We installed new equipment in those fabs. I'm not going to say that goes without challenges, and I want to thank our employees for actually making that happen. But we didn't really see any significant slowdown in China. So moving into Q2, it's pretty much business as usual. There hasn't been any significant change in for the most part, in the way that they have been laying out their products, and if anything, I would say, maybe things have accelerated a little bit they're asking for pull-ins, but I'm not sure if that's any acceleration in projects as much as it is what Kevin mentioned earlier, some customers are a little bit nervous about supply chain issues. And so they continue to work with us and contact us to make sure that we are able to ship their products on time and they're happy to take, in some cases, take them earlier if we can get the shipments out earlier.
David Duley: Okay. Final question for me is, as far as the evaluation systems that were placed during the March quarter, I mentioned, I guess, three. You got follow-on orders for one of those evals. Would we expect follow-on orders from the other two evaluation systems in the current quarter, or when would we expect follow-ons for those other evals?
Mary Puma: So, all of those evals were memory evals. They are applications. We've been working with the customer on for a long time. But I think given some of the things that are going on and the timing of the investment plans of those customers, I don't think it's something that we're necessarily going to see in the short-term, meaning the next quarter, maybe even two quarters.It's just simply a function of planning and when those customers are going to make an investment. And I'm not sure any of those things have changed significantly as a result of what's going on right now with the pandemic. I think it's something that we knew in advance or have known for a while.
David Duley: Great. Thanks for answering my questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company.
Mark Miller: Thank you for the question. I'm glad everyone is staying healthy at Axcelis.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks Mark.
Mark Miller: You're welcome. In terms of eval tools, do you have any eval tools in Japan currently?
Mary Puma: No, we don't have any eval tools in Japan currently. The tool that we're seeing is not going to be an eval. We have one outstanding evaluation right now that is being used by an image sensor customer that we are forecasting will close within this year.But as Kevin mentioned, and Doug mentioned, we have a lot of new products right now that we're working with customers on to see the market and we will have additional evals going out throughout the year.In fact, a significant number of evals going out, which, again, as Kevin mentioned, is one of the things driving our operating expenses for the year. But it's a great investment. It's for us to make for the future for the 550 and 650 model.
Mark Miller: I believe you said you mentioned you weren't really seeing any major impact in terms of component supply for your equipment because of the virus. Was that correct?
Kevin Brewer: No. So -- well, I guess, yes and no. So, we're working around issues on a daily basis, Mark. But at this point, we've been able to resolve most of the issues we've had, some of them have been taken longer than others. It's definitely impacted the in the factory in terms of the starts and stuff. But there's been nothing to date has put us down hard. We've been able to so far work around things.And as I mentioned, probably the biggest impact is the unknown at this point. I know what I know, but I don't know what I don't know. And there are -- we have had to deal with some are actually some of the smaller suppliers where there discrete outbreaks and their factories and they had to shut down for a period of time. So, that's kind of what we're navigating around.I think in terms of what the governments are going to do around the world of various we have a good handle on the capacity of our suppliers. We know where there are to restrictions. You know what the limitations are working with.So, again, this is more about what could change on a daily basis and discrete components that's -- we buy a lot of parts, but there's millions of parts that go into the parts we buy.So, it's hard to even know it could happen any discrete component or capacitor transist or whatever. So anyway, we're working around what we know at this point, Mark.
Mark Miller: You benefited from a lower corporate tax rate in the March quarter. Is that going to go back to the more normal corporate tax rate in the rest of quarters of this year?
Kevin Brewer: Yes, I mean, I'm not sure we're going to -- if we're going to -- I think we've always quoted is 21%, 22%. There still could be different pickups in there. We have R&D tax credit, for example, that we're still working through, but it will probably come up from where it was in Q1.
Mark Miller: What was the reason? Was so low, was it the R&D tax credit phasing in?
Kevin Brewer: Yes, there was credits that we had a through that we phased in.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Two, please. First on, Mary, from the depiction that we're hearing around China, it seems that China has potential to stay more in the mid- to high 30s then drift back towards what's historically been about 30% of sales. Is that a fair view of what the team is seeing over the next quarter or so?
Mary Puma: Craig, I'm not going to give you any guidance on China. I will say that we do expect it to continue to contribute a large portion of our revenues moving out through the rest of the year.
Craig Ellis: Okay. And then the follow-up question is more strategic, and it goes back to Analyst Day. At Analyst Day, I thought one of the more interesting slides relative to the 550 and 650 models, where the market segmentation work the team had done across mature process technology, membrane, advanced, logic in the 30 to 40 implant recipes that the company sees across those as incremental opportunities for new product and custom product. As we move through this year and exit 2020, Mary, where will we be in terms of progress, placing product into those 30 to 40 incremental recipes? And what should we expect the team could do in 2021 there?
Mary Puma: Doug, do you want to take that?
Doug Lawson: Sure. So, Craig, the XEmax is a key product in the image sensor space that we're going after several recipes. So we would expect and hope that we'll see valuation systems for that over that time frame that you're discussing. Purion Dragon certainly has a lot of interest, has first eval closed and the first follow-on for a NAND order, as I mentioned before. And one of the other questions, we would expect additional activity in NAND and in the DRAM and hopefully into logic over that cycle.And then the Purion H is -- Purion H200, excuse me, is targeted first and foremost at the power device market. And so there's a lot of interest there because it's a much more productive tool for those applications, which is key to the customers in reducing the overall cost of their devices. So I think that we should over this next couple of years that you described, see many applications and many new evals of -- especially, of those three systems.
Craig Ellis: That's great. Thanks, team.
Doug Lawson: Thanks, Craig.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: And it does conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma who will make some closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Julie. I'd like to thank everyone for listening to our call, and we hope you can join us virtually for several conferences this spring. We will be participating in the Craig-Hallum 17th Annual Institutional Investor Conference on May 27. The Cowen 2020 Technology Media and Telecom Conference on May 29, and the Stifel 2020 Cross Sector Insight Conference on June 8. We will also be participating in virtual non-deal roadshows with D.A. Davidson and B. Riley during the quarter. We thank you for your continued support, and please stay healthy.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect.";[-0.19680492523835214, 0.11411476167194423];0.11411476167194423;-0.19680492523835214;0
29;ACLS;2020-08-05;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies call to discuss the company's Results for the Second Quarter 2020. My name is Kevin and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. We are all participating in this call remotely, so I would like to apologize in advance for any technical difficulties. If you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. Please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits, and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor provision. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K, annual report, and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We have successfully completed our second quarter, while continuing to operate in the COVID-19 environment. We hope you and your families are healthy, especially as the virus has aggressively spread in many different regions of the world. At Axcelis, we are carefully managing the situation. Although we are dealing daily with this constantly changing environment, we remain laser focused on the strategic objectives outlined at our Investor Day last September. During the second quarter, we realized two key milestones along the path to capturing market leadership in ion implantation and achieving our long-term business models. This involves shipping two new Purion product evaluations; our second Purion Dragon eval to a large memory customer for a DRAM application, and the first Purion XEmax eval to a large image sensor customer. In the second half of 2020 Axcelis expects to ship additional evaluation systems of both Purion extensions and Purion based products to customers for new applications. These evaluation systems will increase our footprint and enable our long-term business objectives. While during a time like this, it can be difficult to deliver short-term commitments and stay focused on the future. The dedication and determination of our employees has made this possible. Maintaining their health and safety continues to be our top priority. So once again, I would like to personally give a heartfelt thank you to our extraordinary employees in the factory, in global field locations, and those that [come in] the U.S. and around the world who are working diligently to meet our customer commitments. I also want to thank our suppliers and customers for their support as we strive to meet the continuing high level of customer interest in our Purion products. Our second quarter financial performance was very strong. Revenue for the second quarter was $123 million, with earnings per share of $0.39, gross margins of 42.2% and a cash balance of $197 million at quarter-end. Our aftermarket business or what we refer to as CS&I contributed significantly to our revenue and gross margin in the quarter, exceeding our expectations. During the second quarter, memory accounted for 35% of our shipments, 16% DRAM and 19% NAND. The remaining 65% of shipments went to mature foundry logic customers. The geographic mix of our system shipments in the second quarter was China 59%, Korea 36%, and Taiwan 5%. This mix highlights the strength of the mature foundry logic market in both China and Korea. China shipments will likely remain strong in the third quarter. While 2021 is expected to be a very strong year for the semiconductor equipment industry as the memory market recovers, uncertainty relative to the second half of 2020 still exists. The impact of COVID-19 continues to create supply chain installation and other logistics challenges. The current geopolitical climate has impacted the plans of some customers, with the stability of the global economy also contributing uncertainty to the mix. Despite all of this, the market demand for semiconductors overall continues to be very strong. Last quarter we did not provide guidance due to this uncertainty. This quarter, we will, but we caution that visibility remains limited. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $110 million, with gross margins of approximately 42.5%, operating income in the range of $10.5 million to $11.5 million and earnings per share of approximately $0.24. Axcelis had a very strong first half due to robust customer demand, and our ability to successfully mitigate pandemic related issues in the supply chain and factory. This allowed us to ship systems on time and to accommodate customer requests for earlier deliveries. While our Q3 guidance is down slightly as a result of our first strong half performance, through the first three quarters of 2020, we expect year-over-year revenue to be up 50%. While the COVID-19 pandemic has generated uncertainty and presented new challenges in 2020, it is important to understand that the semiconductor industry is critical in today's world, and remains fundamentally strong. Investment in both technology and capacity will accelerate as we enter 2021. We expect to see individual customers and market segments continue to respond differently to COVID-19 challenges. Semiconductor products required for working from home are currently in high-demand. This includes products for PCs, video streaming, and communications. At the same time, demand for products related to automotive and aviation for example, have slowed. Our knowledge and expertise in ion implantation allows us to work closely with our customers across all of these market segments, regardless of their particular market dynamics to provide them with the best ion implant solutions for their emerging manufacturing challenges. As a result of these relationships, we have developed new Purion products that provide both Axcelis and our customers a significant competitive advantage. This has been critical to developing our large and diverse customer base. Last September, we introduced four new Purion products touring the high current segment, which represents greater than 50% of the ion implant TAM, and touring the high energy segment, representing approximately 30% of the TAM. The two new products in the high current segment are the Purion Dragon for advanced logic and memory applications, and the Purion H200 for advanced power device applications. These new products combined with the latest versions of the [Purion H] base product are the key to our growth in high current, the large segment of the ion implant market. The two new high energy products are the Purion XE silicon carbide for advanced silicon carbide power devices, and the [Purion XEmax for its sensors]. These new products abide with the popular [Purion DXE] will extend Axcelis’ market and technology leadership in the growing high energy market. Today, three of the four new products have already shipped to customers and we expect shipment of the fourth, the Purion H200 during the third quarter. We also plan to place more evaluations of the new Purion product extensions and the base Purion products in the second half of this year as we set the table to achieve our $650 million target business model. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin to discuss our financials and some operational details. Kevin?
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary. Good morning. Before I discuss our very strong second quarter performance, I'll provide an update and Axcelis’ management of the pandemic. At this point, all areas of our business and supply chain are operating well as a result of the extraordinary effort of our employees and suppliers, and continuing customer demand for our products. The health and well-being of our employees remains a top priority. We are doing our best to create a safe work environment for everyone at Axcelis. For those who must work in our factory, we continue to enforce safeguards like physical distancing, and a required use of face mask. Everyone who can work from home is working from home and will continue to do so for now. Field based teams are supporting our customers while following both government and customer required safety protocols. We have added further flexibility for installation teams using skilled third party support and creative virtual solutions. We remain focused on our $550 million and $650 million target models and continue to make sizable investments, evaluation tools, and new products. [Cost-out initiatives] and growing percentage of revenue from these new products are driving gross margin improvement. Although the current environment has created challenges, the actions we have taken have allowed us to successfully navigate through this pandemic so far. Now turning to the second quarter results. Q2 revenue finished at $123 million well above consensus, compared to $119 million in Q1. Q2 system sales were $76.8 million, compared to $82.3 million in Q1. Q2 CS&I revenue finished at $46.2 million compared to $36.7 million in Q1. CS&I was exceptionally strong this quarter with spares and consumables running higher than expected driven by fab utilization and customers likely maintaining a higher levels there to minimize supply chain disruption. We also shipped several used tools in the quarter, which comprise approximately $7 million of our total CS&I revenues. We do not expect used tools shipments to report at that level, as a result, Q3 CS&I revenues should be in the $36 million range. Q2 sales for our Top 10 customers accounted for 83.6% of total sales, compared to 85.9% in Q1. Three customers were at 10% or above. Q2 system bookings were $56.2 million, compared to 115.1 billion in Q1 with a Q2 book-to-bill ratio of 0.73 versus 1.37 in Q1. Backlog in Q2 including deferred revenue finished at $102.6 million, compared to $127 million in Q1. As noted in some of our prior calls, bookings and backlog can fluctuate quite a bit quarter-to-quarter due to the customer specific ordering practices. For example, some of our largest customers [often booked until] within the same quarter. Q2 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $35.5 million or 28.9% of revenue, driven by higher evaluation tools in COVID-related expenses, compared to 31.8 million for 26.8% in Q1. SG&A in the quarter was $19.5 million with R&D at 16 million. We expect operating expenses around at approximately $36 million per quarter for the rest of the year to support numerous evaluation systems and additional costs associated with the pandemic. Q2 gross margin was 42.2%, compared to 38.3% in Q1. Q2 gross margin was driven by strong CS&I contribution, product mix, and ongoing cost-out efforts. Q3 gross margin is expected to be approximately 42.5% with full year gross margin now about 41%. We are forecasting and pandemic related expense of approximately $1.8 million in Q3 spread across the P&L. Operating profit in Q2 finished at $16.4 million, compared to 13.7 million in Q1. Q2 net income was $13.3 million or $0.39 per share and above consensus compared to 11.2 million or $0.33 per share on Q1. Inventory ended at $149.2 million, compared to $136.1 million in Q1 with the timing or shipments and additional inventory to support evaluation tools. Q2 inventory turns excluding evaluation tools finished at 2.1 compared to 2.2 in Q1. Q2 accounts payable were $30.3 million, compared to 26.1 million in Q1. Q2 receivables of $64.9 million, compared to 64.2 million in Q1. Q2 cash finished at $197 million, compared to 181.4 million in Q1. Cash from operations in the quarter were 16.9 million. Our stock repurchase program remains on hold as we continue to maintain a conservative cash strategy following invest in areas of the business that will drive customer satisfaction and growth and revenue in gross margin. In late May, we filed a Form F3 registration, covering a future offering or common stock or other securities. In addition, last week, we established a new $40 million line of credit. These two financing vehicles offer additional flexibility for our cash strategy. Axcelis entered 2020 with solid momentum. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we will continue to make the necessary investments in our products and the infrastructure required for our $550 million and $650 million target models. As Mary and I have both said, we remain laser focused on achieving these models. Customers continue to have high expectations for our Purion products, which we intend to achieve. As pandemic continues, I’d hope that all of you and your families stay well. Thank you and I’ll now turn the call back to Mary for closing comments.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. During this difficult time, we are fortunate to work in the semiconductor industry. Our technology is critical to support people's ability to work safely, stay informed, and be entertained. We are also at the beginning of an extended growth cycle driven by the new communications capability of 5G technology. The 5G infrastructure build is underway and will accelerate into 2021. New 5G capable phones that will be introduced this fall will lead to a strong memory cycle in 2021. Following this and beginning in 2022, there will be another cycle of industrial IoT applications even bigger than the last, which will drive strong growth in the mature process technology segment. One thing that emerges very clearly from this pandemic is that communication requirement, and the technology to support them are more critical than ever, and that Axcelis is extremely well-positioned for strong growth tied to the upcoming 5G driven cycle. We are pleased with our strong second quarter financial performance and excited by recent and upcoming evaluation shipments of both new Purion product extensions, and enhanced Purion based products that will keep Axcelis on track to achieve our target business models. Axcelis has a competitive Purion product line, a broad and diverse customer base, a strong balance sheet, and a dedicated team of employees. These are the strengths that will carry us through these uncertain times and ultimately drive growth and market leadership in ion implantation. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Kevin?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis: Well thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the very strong execution in the second quarter. I wanted to start with a clarification. Kevin, I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you call out the number of evaluation tools if any in the second quarter? And what is incorporated in your view for third quarter evaluation tool sync gross margin?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, so we didn't call of the specific numbers, but in terms of moving forward, Craig, there’s a significant wrap-up in the evaluation tools coming at us that we plan to place throughout Q3 and Q4 and there are outstanding tools right now at the end of Q2, but we did not close anything within the quarter that we normally announce.
Craig Ellis: Got it.
Mary Puma: Craig. This is Mary. Craig, we have three outstanding evaluations right now. Two are for mature process technology applications for image sensors specifically. And one is at a memory customer for getting qualified for DRAM application?
Craig Ellis: Got it. And then I probably have few Mary. First in the near-term, can you just help us with what you see as you look at the market for the second half of the year, not looking for specific guidance for the fourth quarter, but just your color on puts and takes as you're looking at things you should enter the back half of the year?
Mary Puma: Well, so, you know, as we discussed our revenues over the first three quarters of 2020 were pretty strong, and if you look at them and average them out, you know, they average about $117 million per quarter, which is a very good run rate for Axcelis, You know, as I mentioned there’s about a 50% increase three quarters this year versus last year. At this point, we really don't have enough visibility to determine if this is going to continue for the rest of the year, but what we can say and we've already just talked about it is that customer interest in our Purion products remains high. I mentioned that there’s strong demo activity. Kevin just talked about how we're very excited that we're going to have a significant number of eval’s going out in the second half of the year. We've got a very, you know, broad customer base. So, we're hoping that there will be some puts and takes in some of the segments that perhaps are weak. Some of that may be offset by what's going on in some of the segments where there's a little bit of a stronger demand. So, again, our visibility at this point is not really good, but we feel very good about achieving our long-term business model. We think our market positioning is good. We know that our execution has really been excellent, and you know, we're pretty excited about how the whole Purion rollout is taking place.
Craig Ellis: Excellent execution indeed. The follow-up to those comments and some of the prepared remarks is with regards to next year, from the secular commentary, you had Mary, I think with memory capacity next year and industrial IoT within calendar 2022, does that mean the company is really looking at mixed shift towards memory and then backwards mature foundry in 2021 and 2022? Or is it just much too early to call out or to have a view on how the segment mixed dynamics might play out on the system side over the next few years?
Mary Puma: Well, it's a little bit more difficult, but let me go back to what we consider to be, I'll call it a more normal mix for Axcelis when both mature process technology is strong, and memory is strong, we typically have a 50/50 systems mix. At the beginning of this year, we talked about memory probably for the full-year, encompassing or being about 35% of our systems mix. So, you know, we knew that we were starting to see some recovery from memory, but really remain focused on the fact that in 2021 that memory business will in fact come back and be stronger, and I think it's our expectation again, that we'll see a more balanced mix. So, I mean, I'm not giving that as a forecast, I’m just trying to give you, you know, some parameters that you can think about as both of the segments really are hitting on all cylinders.
Craig Ellis: Got it. Very helpful. Good luck team.
Mary Puma: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: Next question comes from Patrick Ho, Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much, and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe to Mary or Kevin, in terms of the aftermarket business you actually had a very strong quarter, and I know there are different pieces within that business. So, what I wanted to look at was the services portion, and see how you've adjusted to the current pandemic environment, and your ability to continue to support the customers. Obviously, the revenue base tells me that, you know, you're doing a good job on that. What are some of the actions you've taken to ensure that your customers continue to get not only the spare parts and upgrades, but also the services that are needed?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah. So, Patrick it’s Kevin. So, we've definitely seen an uptick in the spares and consumable business, and you know, I'm sure a chunk of that right now is customers, you know, making sure they have parts on the shelf and mitigating any possible supply chain disruption that the virus may cause but in particular what we’ve done in the business and really it's been across the board for all of our, you know, systems and CS&I businesses supply chain. Very early on we, you know, like a lot of our peers, I mean it was definitely a struggle, a supply chain, but very early on, we got ahead of it with where we had dual source capability. We quickly added, you know, additional capabilities. We got advanced buys out with critical components, and probably most importantly, we’ve got into our MRP system and adjusted our lead time offsets, so we could pull material in more quickly. So, I guess what I'm saying is, we got in-line early, because everybody is kind of running to the door trying to get material delivered. We coordinated with all of our suppliers on logistics, because logistics is going to hang up for a lot of people, and you know, I'm not going to say it wasn't a struggle for us, but we got ultimate [carries in a hurry]. We got away from, you know, we used to do bulk shipments, but we quickly got away from that because we knew that wasn't going to happen quickly. So, I would say the biggest thing is on the supply chain and you know our manufacturing processes remain strong throughout this virus. We've done a great job in the facility keeping people healthy to date, and we focus on that daily. We have daily COVID meetings. So, I think it's just been a lot of planning, Patrick, and you know, increasing capacity or capability and you know, where we saw maybe some choke points coming up.
Patrick Ho: Great, that's helpful. Maybe as my follow up question for Mary in terms of the customer mix, [trailing edge foundry] continues to be a high portion of it, with China being a key region, have you seen any puts and takes, you know, given the geopolitical situation? Have you seen customers potentially taking tools, somewhat earlier than you expected, or is there timing still pretty much where you expected them to take tools?
Mary Puma: I think to the most part, timing is where we expected them to take tools. That said, we just talked about the fact that given, you know, some of the pandemic related issues, not trade-related issues, we have had instances where, because of logistics concerns, we have certainly, you know, we've had the capability and we have pulled some tools in to the first and second quarter to just ensure that we would get the tools to the customers when they wanted them. So, we don't really see any kind of geopolitical implications in China because of this. You know, the area that China remains very, very strong, it's a large percentage of Axcelis revenues on average, you know, we typically say it's 30%. Based on what we know today, it will likely be a higher percentage of our revenues for the full-year, and you know, the mature process technology segment does continue to be, you know, very strong and even though usually, our systems activity in China typically comes from the global semiconductor companies, but it's really the domestic customers right now, in combination with some of the multi-nationals that are actually doing quite a bit of investment.
Patrick Ho: Great, thank you very much.
Kevin Brewer: Thanks, Patrick. Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks Pat.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Tyler] on for Christian. Thanks for letting us ask a couple of questions. First question…
Kevin Brewer: Sure.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. First question on gross margins, I was wondering if you could give a little more color? Your guidance of Q3 for 42.5% is already the mid-point of your 550 million target, you expect revenue to be down sequentially, expect fares to be down sequentially, you commented on number of eval tools coming in Q3 in the second half, so I was wondering if you could just comment on the puts and takes on the strong gross margin guys?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, so to your point, I mean, our target model for 550 has 42% to 43%, and I think where you're hitting that is that we're, you know, we're guiding that range right now. The things that really drives the margin from quarter-to-quarter is the mix of CS&I, the mix within the product, you know, as we all know from our entire IR presentation, high energy mix drives stronger margins, although you know, we continue to work at the high current product line in meeting [indiscernible] you can kind of see the trends that we've been improving the gross margins on both of those product lines. Cost out continues, I mean we're taking advantage of cost out efforts that they’ve working for a number of years now. We still have numerous projects underway. I think we've mentioned this before, the product extensions tend to carry higher margins with them. It is more of a premium pricing, because I guess there's a little bit more of a specialty tool, but we're seeing a larger mix of these products, the product extensions right now with this help in the margins. So, those are all things that are moving us to that. You know, what I will point out, the growth in the 550 model is going to come from the system side of the business predominantly, you know, we still expect CS&I to grow. Every time we put a new tool out, there's, you know, there's revenue that comes back with spare parts and service and things, but, you know, the systems is going to drive the growth of 550 and 650. And, you know, we know that systems aren't as creative as CS&I. So, we're going to be growing a business with, you know, the not so accretive side of the two pieces of the equation. So, that's what you know, tempers the 42 to 43 of 550 because we know a big chunk of that revenue is going to be systems, we know, a big chunk of that revenue is going to come from high currents, in terms of systems and right now, those are, you know, lower gross margins or standard margin or we continue to work on that. So, you know, 42 to 43 is where we think we'll be at 550. And we'll have some quarters that, you know, were there ahead of time, but I think, you know, a full-year basis of that revenue model that's where we can expect it to see, and then, you know on the 650 model we've jumped up, you know another one or two points on the gross margins.
Unidentified Analyst: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you. Second question then, just, you know, large competitive maintenance [indiscernible]. So, I guess I was wondering if, you know your guidance may be a little bit conservative, just given the current environment and some uncertainty there, or is it a, is it just a difference of end-market, your exposure to mature foundry versus more leading edge, or you know, the high spares in the quarter, any commentary on that would be great?
Mary Puma: I think at this point, our guidance is our guidance, you know, Tyler. We took a hard look at it. We gave our best estimate based on a number of things in terms of what's going on in the market. Challenges from COVID, you know talking to our customers. So, at this point-in-time, I mean, that's basically what we're, you know where we are at this at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: Fair enough. Understood. That's all from me guys. Thanks.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.
Tom Diffely: Yeah. Good morning. First question…
Kevin Brewer: Hi, Tom.
Tom Diffely: Hello. Kevin. I was wondering, when you look at the bookings, soft bookings in the quarter, do you chalk that up to just kind of normal lumpiness in your business or has there been kind of a COVID driven impact with less face-to-face meetings that have made it more difficult to close a booking?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, so I don't think there's been any [impasse] on the sales execution side of business. I think, you know, even though face-to-face hasn't, you know, been the preferred method of meeting, we still have country managers in each of the regions. So, and they have been able to meet new customers. So, you know, it's probably more at the executive team level where the meetings of the contact, but certainly the country managers have been in meeting. And we're using where we can video meetings, even to the extent possible. I think, you know, you hit it, I mean, there's always lumpiness for the quarter. There's no doubt that the numbers suggest things slowed down a little bit, but as I pointed out, we do have customers with different ordering practices and frankly, we have one very large customer who always issues a PO and take shipments in the same quarter and sometimes those are within weeks or days of occurrence. So that can move it around. So, it's, you know, it's hard. It's always hard on our book-to-bill, you know, numbers are really to see what's going on. I mean, I think more importantly, the backlog number is still up over $100 million, which is pretty strong for us, even though we’ve gone a little bit from last quarter, it's still over 100 million in this quarter.
Tom Diffely: Okay, so when you look at the business activity that your customers kind of talked to you about before they placed the hard orders, the activity you see for the years is what you expected? No [indiscernible] delays.
Kevin Brewer: While it is actually the, you know, we, I think our quoting activity is a lot stronger in the first half than we expected. So, I think as Mary said, you know, we've tried to accommodate customers and pole in where we could, because, you know, the biggest fear everybody's having is not going to get the tools and certainly, you know, a lot of, a lot of companies struggled in this, you know this environment. So, we’re fortunate that we were able to accommodate customers who wanted to see you know, an earlier delivery and our supply chain, you know, is still holding up and as I said, our factories, you know, both supply chain and the factory have done a phenomenal job executing. So, yeah, so I – you know, I think, if anything I'd say was probably a little stronger where we saw was, I mean, at first that was probably defies logic, when I say that, but that's just the fact of matter that’s how it was.
Tom Diffely: Okay.
Mary Puma: Yeah, I mean, if you're looking for any areas where perhaps there was a little bit of softness, I think you're trying to get it, you know, what's potentially moved around. We have had some softness and seen some customers delay their investment, particularly in the mature process technology area related to automotive, and you know, certain industrial kinds of products and I don't think that that's a surprise to anybody. I'm sure our peers and competitors are seeing the same thing.
Tom Diffely: Great. And then Mary, maybe the follow up, are there any update to Japan, I know you have system order last quarter, just wondering how that's going and how you look at the Japanese market as a new leg of growth for you?
Mary Puma: Yeah, things are, you know, things continue to go well, we did ship that first Purion system to Japan in the third quarter and it's a Purion XE for a power device application. So, you know, that was very exciting. And that was a result of our, you know, a couple of year, a great distribution agreement with Screen, which has now ended, but it was a great experience. They really introduced us to the Japanese market. We got to know the key Japanese customers, learned, you know, details on the Japanese implant market, and one of the big takeaways is that because of the complexity of the tool in the sales process, the Japanese customers actually want to buy directly from Axcelis. So, you know, we had a small team in place. We have added resources to that team, including hiring a country manager. So, we're building our own infrastructure in Japan to support the customers there and the market opportunity is actually very exciting. We've talked about how the Japanese market on average is about 15% of the total available market for implants. So, about $150 million. So, it's a very lucrative opportunity for us. And we feel really good about the seeds that we’re planting to be able to take advantage of that opportunity.
Tom Diffely: Great. Thanks for your time this morning.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Charles Shi] of Needham.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you for taking my question. First off, congratulations on the very good results for June quarter. So, I have a question regarding the end market mix, it looks to me that for the first quarter, you had a very strong quarter for memory; second quarter, looks like the system revenue maybe down a little bit and with a mix shifting to mature foundry logic nodes a little bit strong; and in the third quarter you're expecting China continues to be strong, which I assume a majority of that will be mature nodes. And my question is, it looks to me there is a memory, your memory system sales seems to be sequentially going down through the year, but I think I heard you think that the memory sales for the full-year is probably holding up at least 35%. If I heard it wrong, please correct me, but if that's the case, it looks to me you're expecting some sort of the memory rebound in the fourth quarter. And just want to make sure whether I'm thinking about this, correct?
Mary Puma: So, I think the first part of what you said is true, in terms of the mixed and the memory mix shifting a little bit over the last few quarters. So, I'm looking here at, memory was about – for shipments, memory in the fourth quarter was about 39%. First, which was up from 14%; first quarter 52, third quarter 35, and then we don't forecast. We don't – we really don't provide a forecast by segment moving into the third and fourth quarter. So, you know, we have not implied anything really about the memory market other than to say, we really don't have a lot of visibility at this point in time. We do expect memory to pick back up, particularly in the 2021 timeframe. So, I think you'll have to connect the dots on your own, but again, we have not given any explicit guidance about that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, okay, understood. So must follow-up question. The second question on that is around gross margins. So, it looks to me that for the third quarter, the CS&I revenue on absolute dollar basis, looks – will be go down a little bit. That means the systems as a part of the total revenue will go up, yet you're guiding a very strong gross margin, implying, sort of implying to me that system gross margins will have meaningful improvement for the third quarter. I wonder what's driving that and how much of that is from maybe you are expecting some of the eval turns in the third quarter, which essentially carry higher margin for example, the Purion XEmax, those relatively newer products or higher percentage of the product extension?
Kevin Brewer: Yes. So, let's say, as the product mix, driving the margins in the third quarter and the cost out efforts that we continue to work through the system. We’ve got, on any given week, any given month, there’s new cost out initiatives that are kicking in, and parts coming in at lower cost of the factory through different [Kaizen] lowering labor costs. So, your point is well taken. We have, you know, we're basically saying, we're not going to have this real accretive CS&I as the majority of the revenue in Q3. So, systems must be coming up and they are, and like I said, it's the mix; it’s the cost out that's driving it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, okay. Thank you very much. That's all my questions and congratulations again.
Kevin Brewer: Yes. Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company.
Mark Miller: Congrats on your results. I have a question. Taiwanese sales were very late this quarter from the previous quarters, what's going on there?
Mary Puma: You know, I mean, again, it's just a function of what the customers buy from us in any geography and the timing of their investment. So, it's – we have not lost any business there. It's just an investment timing issue.
Mark Miller: Okay. How would you characterize recent quoted activity? Is it picking up, you were counting on 5G and we are hearing from other people 5G is starting to pick up in their business? Are you seeing anything correlate with 5G and what was the overall quoting level during the quarter?
Mary Puma: We don't typically talk about quoting level other than to say that, you know, in the first quarter, it was very high. We don't, I mean, we can't base any forward-looking kinds of revenues on that quoting activity. I think basically at this point in time, we – it's fair to say that we're quoting on, you know, most of the major projects that are up there that you know about that our customers are pursuing.
Mark Miller: And the inventory rise in the June quarter from the prior quarter is that because of the expected higher system sales?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, that mean, there's a little bit of buildup in the whip and finished goods because of the timing of some of the shipments for Q3. So, the inventory was still there at the end of the quarter. And then, Mark we have, we are building up on eval systems. As I mentioned, there's going to be a pretty sizable ramp up in the number of evals that we're putting out over the next few quarters. And those don't, until those evals are recognized, they stay in inventory. So, we have three out there that I may have mentioned right now, but there’s numerous more going.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Yeah. Thank you.
Mary Puma: Thanks Mark.
Operator: You do not have any further questions at this time. [Operator Instructions] This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. We hope to talk with you virtually at several upcoming investor events. We will be participating in the Needham Virtual SemiCap and EDA Conference next week. And we expect to conduct several virtual NVRs during the quarter as well. We thank you for your continued support and please stay healthy.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[0.22247394269622878, 0.12794160855934256];0.12794160855934256;0.22247394269622878;1
31;ACLS;2021-02-11;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Axcelis Technologies Call to discuss the company's results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020. My name is Jerome and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mary Puma, President and CEO of Axcelis Technologies. Please proceed, ma'am.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Jerome. With me today is Kevin Brewer, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Doug Lawson, Executive Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Strategy. We are all participating in this call remotely. So, I would like to apologize in advance for any technical difficulties. If you've not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. Playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. Please note the comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the SEC's Safe Harbor Provision. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. These risks are described in detail in our Form 10-K, Annual Report and other SEC filings, which we urge you to review. Our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As a result of the strength of the overall electronics market and the growth of the Purion product family in 2020, Axcelis delivered its highest annual revenue in the last 15 years. To achieve this, our employees managed through many difficult logistical challenges brought on by the geopolitical environment and the continuing pandemic. I'd like to thank our employees for delivering these results while continuing to serve our customers and adhering to safety protocols. This challenging environment has continued into 2021, but despite this, we are planning for another year of growth at Axcelis. The semiconductor industry is forecast against strength across all markets and the Purion product family is poised for significant growth. Our fourth quarter financial performance was in line with our updated increased guidance. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $122.2 million with earnings per share of $0.43, gross margins of 43.4% and  inherent cash balance of $204.2 million. EPS was favorably impacted by previously unrecognized tax benefit of $0.11 per diluted share. For the full year 2020, revenue was $47.6 million with an EPS of $1.46. Our aftermarket business or what we refer to as CS&I, once again contributed significantly to our revenue and gross margin. CS&I revenue was $68 million in Q4 and $181 million for the full year 2020. This strong performance was a result of high fab utilization, the growing Purion install base and additional buying activity from one customer as a result of the current geopolitical situation.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you, Mary and good morning. Axcelis delivered exceptional fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial performance. Thanks to the continued outstanding work of our employees and supply chain partners. Strong execution across the board and significant leverage in our business model delivers 140% increase operating profit and revenue growth of 38%. During this ongoing pandemic, the health and wellbeing of our employees remains a top priority. We are doing our best to create a safe work environment for everyone at Axcelis. Pandemic related protocols that were implemented during 2020 remain in place with 2021. Our pandemic response team will continue to closely monitor these actions and update as required. We remain focused on our target business model and expect 2021 to be another growth year for Axcelis. We will continue to invest in product, the evaluation tools and infrastructure needed to support our $650 million target model. Turning to fourth quarter and full year financial results. Q4 revenue finished at $122.2 million and above our updated guidance compared to a $110.4 million in Q3. Q4 system sales was $64.3 million compared to $70.3 million in Q3. Q4 CS&I revenue finished at $58 million compared to $40.2 million in Q3. The unusually high CS&I revenue in Q4 was driven by fab utilization, a growing Purion install base and significant buying in the quarter by one of our customers. We expect Q1 CS&I revenue of approximately $42 million and we recommend modeling at this quarterly level for 2021. Full year 2020 revenue was $474.6 million, compared to $343 million in 2019, an increase of 38%. Systems revenue was $293.6 million, compared to $202.6 million in 2019, an increase of 45%. CS&I revenue was $181 million, compared to $140.4 million in 2019, an increase of 29%. Q4 sales from our top 10 customers accounted for at 81.5% of our total sales compared to 76% in Q3. These customers were 10% above in Q4 but same as the Q3. For the full year, 74% of revenue came from our top 10 customers with two at 10% and above. Q4 system bookings were $131.5 million compared to $26.4 million in Q3. Our Q4 book-to-bill ratio of 1.98 versus 0.37 in the Q3. Backlog in Q4 including deferred revenue finished at $93.2 million compared to $45.1 million in Q3. Q4 combined SG&A and R&D spending was $38.9 million or 31.8% of revenue compared to $34.3 million or 31% in Q3. Q4 combined SG&A and R&D spending was higher than the forecast primarily driven by variable compensation expense.
Mary Puma: Thank you, Kevin. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance as well as our exceptional overall performance in 2020 and are looking forward to another year of growth in 2021. Axcelis has a competitive Purion product line, a broad and diverse customer base, a strong balance sheet and a dedicated team of employees. These are the strengths that will continue to drive our growth toward our $650 million model and ultimately to a market leadership position in ion implantation. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Jerome?
Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. You may now ask your question.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much, and congrats on a really nice finish to the year and the outlook for '21. Mary, maybe first off in terms of the market environment. You're talking about the memory recovery in '21. Compared to three months ago, do you see the magnitude of that memory recovery being close to greater than it was three months ago? And I guess, how does that essentially impact from their standpoint the wafers that are build out, as well as how many tools you maybe shipping to the memory market in '21?
Mary Puma: Okay so Patrick, we've been saying now for quite a while that we expect a recovery in memory in 2021. I think if you take a look back, if you remember in Q3, we actually shipped no systems to the memory - to any memory customers. In Q4, that had increased to 25% and we're actually saying that we expect memory to account for 30% to 40% of our system's revenue in 2021. And that's in comparison and up from 29% which is where we ended for full year 2020. So, we are starting to see some signs of the memory recovery and we expect it to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Doug, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that?
Doug Lawson: Sure, thanks Mary. Patrick, the recovery that we're seeing in this past quarter is 15% and 10% for DRAM and NAND and we expect we're seeing activity on both fronts, both NAND and DRAM. And so, as we've been saying about this particular memory recovery, we see it as more of a longer-term couple of year kind of recovery versus what we saw back in '17 and '18 where it was steep. There'll ultimately be more area under the curve in terms of growth as a result and we're poised to do well there with our position. The percentages of memory versus maturity in our projections are primarily due to the fact that the mature markets are just so active right now and that's become a much bigger piece of our business compared to what it was back in '17, '18 timeframe.
Patrick Ho: Great that's helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question for Kevin, in terms of your working capital management. AR obviously is a little bit up which may highlight some of the linearity but you're also building some inventory. Have you run into any supply constraints on your end as you're preparing for a higher level of shipments this year? Any supply constraints or issues on that front in procuring parts?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, so thanks Patrick, it's a good question. So, I would say the supply chain constraints are what they've been for most of 2020 with the pandemic. Things were tight. We've continued to drive inventory probably a little ahead of what we needed to be. So, that we're not waiting for long lead material. And as things kind of tightened up in different parts in 2020, we were able to move things around a little bit. We do have income pace with multiple suppliers. So, it's about the same now. I think the pandemic related issues are improving, but as you point out the industry is ramping. So, there's an additional pressure coming for a different reason now, but all-in-all, I would say it's above what we had deal with last year, so I don't expect any issues. We're keeping up with what we need to do this year ramping.
Patrick Ho: Great, thank you very much.
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, thanks Patrick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. You may now ask your question.
Craig Ellis: Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a real strong 2020 and finished the year clean. So, I just wanted to start with a near term question. It's clear that the company believes that CS&I will move backwards to that $42 million level. But within the memory and mature foundry business can you just characterize some of the gives and takes for the first quarter? And help us understand how DRAM versus NAND might be performing to start the year?
Mary Puma: Okay so…Go ahead Doug, you can take it if you like.
Doug Lawson: Okay, sorry about that. So, Craig, we're seeing activity on both fronts and as we're more dependent on wafer start additions and so we're seeing activity from both sides, relatively evenly in the fourth quarter from - as we look at the first quarter, we're seeing activity in both fronts. So, it looks good. From a mature standpoint, the mature markets are very active, have been throughout the 2020 and continue and we don't see that slowing down in 2021. So,
Craig Ellis: That's helpful. And then maybe…
Mary Puma: Yeah, and Craig if you want…
Craig Ellis: Go ahead Mary.
Mary Puma: No, I was just going to give a little bit more color on the mature markets. So, last year image sensor and the general mature foundry business was very strong and it continues to be into 2021. Automotive showed weakness, but we do see it recovering. And that's going to be positive for the power device market which is going to be positive for Axcelis. And then as Doug said, we're seeing activity on both sides of memory. So, it's we're getting to the point where we see most of our markets and market segments beginning to hit on full cylinders.
Craig Ellis: That's great. And then longer-term, the company commented on memory being 30% to 40% of systems. Can you just characterize the demand visibility that you have through calendar '21 in different parts that mature foundry and with DRAM and NAND specifically so we can get a sense of how far out order visibility extends now?
Mary Puma: Yeah, I mean, I think we've very good visibility into the first half of the year and things are starting to become clearer moving into the second half of the year. But we are seeing changes in terms of customer timing both pull-ins and some delays in some cases not really because of the market I think, what I would say I would characterize it mostly as some slight delays in fab readiness. So, we expect, that's normal for us. So, I don't think we're seeing anything is necessarily out of the ordinary at this point in time. So, as I said, first half visibility good, second half starting to improve and I think customers do realize that given the ongoing challenges with the pandemic and in some cases the geopolitical situation, they may need to walk in on their forecast and notify suppliers maybe a little bit sooner than they normally would just because they want to make sure they get in the queue for their systems given some of the lean times that are out there right now. Kevin just commented that things seem to be manageable at this point in time. But you add a ramp on top of the pandemic and you can get some issues at some point moving forward. So, customers are aware of that.
Craig Ellis: Absolutely, and then one final one before I hop back in the queue. It's a multi-parter and more in the political round. But first part of it would be, can you apply just any color on the optics that you have into the license granting process and then on the other side of that? I think it was within the last two days that a number of the very large U.S. chip companies were speaking to the new administration and really expressing the need for a lot more federal government help, building out the U.S. chip supply industry. If something were to happen in that regard, what would it mean for Axcelis?
Mary Puma: Well, we're monitoring all the geopolitical situation and the issues obviously on an ongoing basis and so, we've got our legal counsel watching it carefully. We're working with outside trade attorneys; we're very involved with semi our industry trade group to make sure that our voice is heard as well as to better understand the situation. Obviously, investment in semiconductor fabs would be a positive thing and in the U.S., we would love that. We think that that would be a real upside for the U.S. government, the country and for Axcelis. In terms of some of the other geopolitical issues, there's really not a lot to say about what's going on with the licenses. I think, that's maybe what you're poking at a little bit Craig. We've applied for the licenses. We're prepared to ship systems and parts against customer requirements as soon as we receive the licenses. And we just haven't heard anything back yet. As far as we understand, we don't believe that anything significant has changed based on the change in administration. But again, we're basically just waiting.
Craig Ellis: That's helpful. Thanks so much, Mary.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum. You may now ask your question.
Tyler Burmeister: Hey, guys, this is Tyler on behalf of Christian, thanks for letting us ask couple questions. First question, I think you alluded to it, but maybe a little more color. What's your expectation as far as the timing of the memory recovery through the year? Are you expecting kind of a step up here in Q1 or just a gradual permit this year, any color on timing would be great?
Mary Puma: I don't think we necessarily have, enough visibility I mean, I just alluded to the fact that there's visibility in Q1 that leads us to believe that there is a memory and we have visibility into the first half - I'm sorry, and which leads us to believe that a memory recovery will occur in 2021. But we don't - I don't really - we just don't have a view at this point in time. And we're not really going to forecast that in terms of putting numbers around it. So, as I mentioned before, we're seeing an improvement in the percentage of systems that we're shipping out to memory customers. And we do expect that as a percent over the course of the year to increase versus last year, so 30% to 40% versus 29%. But in terms of the timing, we're just going to continue to watch - talk to our customers and watch the trends in the market.
Tyler Burmeister: Understood, that's very helpful. Second question, then. I believe previously your comments were that at some point in 2021, you expect to reach a run rate of your $550 million annual model. So, I guess, given worth Q1 has guided expectations for improving memory market and improving automotive market, I'm wondering if it's reasonable to think that the full year '21 kind of the close to your approach to that $550 million annual target?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah Tyler, it's Kevin. So, obviously, it's in our line of sight right now with the guide we just gave to move on. You're right, we had kind of been saying at some point with the run rate in 2021 and then 2022 event and we're not providing full year guidance at this point. But as you point out and as I just said, it's in our line of sight at this point. And the 650 model continues to say is a couple years after the  But obviously, we're setting up well coming out of the gate if you will.
Tyler Burmeister: Sounds great. Very helpful. That's all for me, guys. Thanks.
Kevin Brewer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. You may now ask your question.
Tom Diffely: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Mary, you said that you expect to close one of your eval tools during the quarter. And I'm wondering what is your thought as far as the process of starting to ramp up production tools based off of the eval over the next few quarters?
Mary Puma: I think the prospects are actually very good. I will actually say that for this evaluation, we have already shipped some repeat orders to that customer prior to the evaluation closing. So, we definitely have been selected as PTO for this specific application. We've shipped some repeat tools, and we expect to ship some additional tools moving forward.
Tom Diffely: Great. And then Kevin, when you look at the margin profile, how big an impact does both the closing of the eval tool have on the margin in the quarter? And then we look at the top and the bottom of your guidance range, what is the impact on the margins there?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, so I mean, eval volumes have a negative effect. Some of the evals have higher costs and others don't so that certainly moves in a number of the eval. And I think what's going on in Q1 is that the evals going now, we've also got a higher mix of high current tools gone out which overall is good for the company, because that's a large market and that's one of the areas we want to continue to grow in this high current. But maybe that could help you a little bit more. If I look at the full year right now Tom, I'm seeing full year gross margin in 2021 similar to what they were in 2020. And that includes a number of evals for analysis, as Mary says, we've got, so one closed not only going out with six, and I think as you recall, typically, we would have two or three. So, we've been saying for the last couple of quarters is a high number of evals and more going. So, those are sitting in on the margins. And the other thing, we're going to see a lot of growth this year coming from systems versus CS&I, right. So, as the systems grow next year in CS&I, that can pressure things a little bit. But the good news is, what all are there in the growth in systems, all these evals, I put this point, we expect gross margins for year to finish similar to last year. And our target model is 42 to 43, on 550. So, we're just off of that a tiny bit. And if you look at, try to do the math and figure when I get there, and I think about cost initiatives, maybe we get there a little bit sooner than we thought, some of these initiatives still have to kick in. So, from a gross margin point of view, I feel really good where we are right now. And expect this year to continue to drive cost out and get the value in kind of a more Purion product extensions, and those are all things we need to get to our model. And then the 650 model, the margins are up to 44 to 45. And that's a couple years later. So, we're - again, we're in good shape Tom.
Tom Diffely: Great and that's very helpful. Thanks for the questions.
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with The Benchmark. You may now ask your question.
Mark Miller: Thank you for the question. Congrats on your progress. Were there any shares repurchase last quarter?
Kevin Brewer: There were not, Mark. So, the program that was in place last year was suspended in Q1, they did not put that back in place. And then the Board approved the new program for this year $100 million. And as a reminder, the prior program was $50 million and we had spent about $25 million in purchasing shares prior to putting that on hold.
Mark Miller: You've indicated recovery in the auto sector. I'm just wondering if that's starting to accelerate, because there's been a lot of talk about chip shortages facing the auto manufacturers. And just wondering if that's really starting to accelerate significantly?
Doug Lawson: Mark, can you repeat the question? I heard the chip shortages, but I wasn't sure what the front end was?
Mark Miller: Well, there's some reports, the auto manufacturers are facing chip shortages. I'm just wondering, you said there was recovery going on the auto is that starting to really accelerate as a quarter went on?
Doug Lawson: We've started to seeing a pickup last quarter, it's we see it in a few different areas. We see it in the power device area which started to strengthen last quarter. And we see that continuing to grow throughout the year. The image sensor market is a big piece of the automotive world these days. And that's been strong and it's hard for us to tell exactly what's going to automotive versus phones and other image sensor applications. And then the general foundry which - general mature foundry which is what's really all in the press these days, where everybody's talking about $0.20 parts keeping lines down, that's that whole foundry, mature foundry market has been strong. Utilizations in that segment have been very high. And so, that's been a big piece of our business over the course of 2020 as people bought all the consumer electronics and PCs and so forth. And that will continue now that you start layering automotive on top of it.
Mark Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. You may now ask your question.
Quinn Bolton: Congratulations on the nice results. Just wanted to ask maybe I missed it. But did you say which of the six eval tools have been accepted for revenue recognition or will be accepted for rev rec in the March quarter?
Mary Puma: No, we didn't say which one would be accepted in Q1. And we didn't talk yet about the new one that will be going out in the quarter, either. So, we'll give more color on that as we progress through the quarter and into next quarter.
Quinn Bolton: I think it was Tom's question that you've already received repeat orders for that eval tool that was closed?
Mary Puma: We have. I guess the only additional color I'll give around it is for an image sensor application and we'll just leave it at that.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you, Mary. The second question I had is, from the CS&I strength in the fourth quarter, it looks like perhaps here, you're not subject to export controls for that part of the business. Just wondering if that's the right read? And given the very strong level of $58 million, is there a risk that, that customer doesn't purchase for some time and CS&I revenue could actually come in below $42 million at some point as that customer digests inventory of spares?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah. I'm not worried about that. I think that the customer who did a lot of buying is also running at a very high utilization rate. And we have shipped a number of tools there. And I think, they obviously, they're probably putting more parts in the shelf, but I think they're going to continue to buy anyway. And as the business grows around this, we had strength across the board. I psyched out that one customer, but there's continued strength across the board. So, I think, the $42 million number that we put out there the model to is the right number to be using. I don't see any downside risk to that.
Quinn Bolton: And just lastly, Kevin, for the $100 million share repurchase program, can you give us any sense, is that going to be under 75.1? Will you be sort of in the markets on a consistent basis, so you're going to try to be opportunistic, any sort of thoughts on how that $100 million buyback is executed this year?
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, Quinn so we'll use the 75.1 which is similar to what we did on the program last year that we were executing under. And beyond that, whether we're opportunistic or not, I mean, it's a - it'll be a Board approved read that we buy to and, I think, the board and management realize that, we should be returning cash to shareholders through some type of program which we agreed as a fairly focus. So, I'm not going to say how much we're going to spend, because right, I mean, we put it out there; we could spend it all or a good portion of it. I guess what I'll leave you is we realized that we need to really use it utilizing this program, so again, that Quinn is…
Quinn Bolton: No, I know you're imitating. Yeah, I know you can't give it too much on timing or amounts. But thanks for the color that you provide. And that's it for me. I'll go back in the queue. Thank you.
Kevin Brewer: Yeah, thanks.
Operator: All right. We have no question at this time again.  This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Puma, who will make a few closing remarks.
Mary Puma: I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and we hope to talk with you virtually at the upcoming investor events. We will be participating in Susquehanna Financial Group's 10th Annual Technology Conference in March. We expect to conduct several virtual MDRs during the quarter as well. We thank you for your continued support and please stay healthy.
Operator: This concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day everyone.";[-0.00216711185247509, -0.010583988140551503];-0.010583988140551503;-0.00216711185247509;1
32;AGYS;2016-08-03;"Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Agilysys Fiscal 2017 First Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Some statements made on today's call will be predictive and are intended to be made as forward-looking within the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Also the company believes that its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that would cause results to differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth in the Company's report on Form 10-K and 10-Q and news releases filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Dennedy, President and CEO.
Jim Dennedy: Thank you, Candice and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today to review our fiscal 2017 first quarter results. Joining me on the call today is our Chief Financial Officer, Janine Seebeck. Before we get started, just a quick reminder that we will be discussing some non-GAAP metrics on the call today, primarily adjusted cash from operations and adjusted EBITDA which eliminates the effect of restructuring and other items that are either non-cash or non-recurring. Reconciliations to GAAP metrics are provided in the financial section of the press release issued earlier today. With that, let me provide a quick overview of the results for the quarter. Total net revenue for the first quarter increased 13% to $31 million including over 31% growth in subscription revenues. However, due to the amortization of developed technology resulting from the general availability of rGuest Stay as expected gross margin in the quarter declined to 52.3% from 59.7% in the prior year period. This led to our reporting operating loss of $2.1 million compared to an operating loss of $277,000 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $441,000 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million in the same period last year. As a result we reported a net loss for the fiscal first quarter of $2.3 million or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $200,000 or a loss of $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year period. Janine will provide a more extensive review of our financial results including the income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations and outlook for fiscal 2017. The business remains healthy and growing. We continue to increase revenue, expand our customer base, increase recurring revenue including rGuest based sales and strategically investing in our business while maintaining a healthy financial outlook. Our hospitality focused business strategy allows us to leverage our iconic food and beverage and lodging solutions, while bringing new innovations to market that will enable us to expand the business we do with our existing customers and develop new strategic customer relationships. In the first quarter, we secured 37 contracts with new customers compared to 45 new customer wins in the prior year period. The total bookings value for our new customer secured in the first quarter fiscal of 2017 more than doubled in value compared to the value of new deals in the first quarter of last year and this value accounts for over 35% of the total value of new deals for all of fiscal 2016. With respect to our installed base, we ended the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with more than 36,000 point-of-sale endpoints installed up 28% from the same period last year. And more than 240,000 rooms managed by our lodging solutions up 4% from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Our goal is to continue to grow both the total number of terminal endpoints and hotel rooms under management. Turning to the end markets we serve. We continue to grow our dominant position in the casino and travel gaming markets and see significant opportunities to continue this growth through share gains as well as market expansion as the emphasis on non-gaming revenues increases. Our bookings in this vertical grew 175% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 versus the prior year period and on a trailing 12-month basis grew by 59%. Of the 37 new customers previously cited we secured four new customers in the gaming market in the quarter with a revenue bookings value in excess of $3.5 million. With over 1,500 casinos in the United States and the ongoing mix shift of gaming industry revenue to non-gaming consumption, the pressure on operators to reduce expense while securing non-gaming revenues intensifies. Agilysys provides the critical systems and important innovations to address this challenge. Our property management, point of sale and business intelligence solutions offer casino operators the tools they need to better understand how their customers interact with the gaming floor and non-gaming amenities. So they can more effectively market and serve customers and keep them coming back. For example, we talked about resort and casino in Polson Montana removed a competing solution and selected Visual One Property Management System and InfoGenesis point of sale in June to streamline operation and enhance guest service at the 111 room property. The Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada chose LMS hosted and rGuest Pay to manage log-in at their casino resorts. We have also seen growing success with new customer opportunities and deployments that displays incumbent providers. An example with our recent engagement with Tropicana Entertainment, where there MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa and Lumiere Place Casino & Hotel properties adopted InfoGenesis in a subscription model and rGuest Pay. Not only do this engagement displace a competitor, but it also serves as an example of a customer adopting both an iconic as well as an rGuest platform based solution. We secured more than five important LMS subscription wins including several customer conversions from a traditional license and maintenance relationship. The LMS subscription wins and conversions are important to our business. We are keeping LMS relevant in a core market and securing an installed base for rGuest Stay when it is ready for the casino markets. The LMS and InfoGenesis win validate the strategy through customer action that the investment and release of rGuest platform related solution provides confidence in a longer-term strategic investment in Agilysys solutions for their hotel and food and beverage needs. The Hotel and Cruise industry, which represents approximately 22% of our total revenues also remains healthy. With 53,000 hotel properties and over 5 million guestrooms in the U.S. alone. We see a significant growth opportunity. The nearest term opportunity will be in the food and beverage operations. This will give operators a positive experience in working with a hospitality focused partner that will lead to greater opportunities in the hotel operations for rGuest Stay, Pay, Analyze and other rGuest platform based solutions. We feel this vertical represents the single greatest growth opportunity for us. While we have been successful in penetrating integrated resorts and luxury properties, we now have the tools necessary to effectively compete for business with chain hotels. With rGuest Stay, we now have a lodging solution for the limited service hotel market and we will have a solution for full service later this fiscal year. In the hotel market, we added 23 new customer wins during the first quarter of 2017 compared to 14 new customer wins during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. On those 23 new agreements we recorded total revenue bookings value of approximately $3.8 million more than doubling the bookings value year-over-year. Recent wins to highlight include the Boca Raton Resort and Club, A Waldorf Astoria Resort in Florida, which selected InfoGenesis point of sale and our rGuest Seat solutions to manage their world class oceanfront property and the Portlander Inn in Portland, Oregon, which selected rGuest Stay. Furthermore, our teams are also successfully transitioning customers from our iconic brand to the rGuest platform and establish a framework for future transitions as in the case of Wild Dunes Resort. Wild Dunes Resort in Isle of Palms selected InfoGenesis Point Of Sale, InfoGenesis Flex and rGuest Pay to streamline food and beverage operations. Wild Dunes Resort is managed by destination hotels, which uses our solution at several of its other properties. And just last month, Grand America Hotels & Resorts in Salt Lake City selected a comprehensive Agilysys solutions suite including InfoGenesis Point Of Sale, rGuest Pay, rGuest Seat to streamline food and beverage delivery at 20 restaurants in six locations. Looking at the rush in food service verticals, which combined represent approximately 26% of our total revenues, we see healthy fundamentals and the potential for significant growth. For example in our RUSH vertical the University of West Georgia recently selected Eatec inventory and procurement system to streamline food service operations in 14 locations including residential dining halls, campus restaurants and convenience stores. It will also use Eatec to support campus catering in concessions. Operators of all sizes are looking for point of sale solutions that will handle loyalty programs and outline order platforms by delivering timely and useful analytics. Moving onto the status of our solutions, we continue to make progress in updating our iconic solutions and bringing to market our rGuest platform based solutions. We recently announced the general availability of our rGuest Stay our cloud based property management system. Today this solutions is available to limited and select service hotels and chains, a large and growing hospitality segment. Future releases of rGuest Stay will support the needs of full service hotels, resorts and gaming properties. rGuest Stay operates as an open system standards-based platform that provides publicly addressable interfaces to more easily connect iconic Agilysys solutions and most third-party solutions to the rGuest hospitality platform. The rGuest platform based solutions make data about guest consumption patterns more available to the operator, it is ultimate to deliver a more customized guest experience. More recently we announced that rGuest Analyze our business intelligence solution is now packaged with InfoGenesis Point Of Sale, enabling hospitality operators to use existing point of sale data to increase revenue more, more effectively manage costs and enhance guest satisfaction. Another key component of the rGuest platform, rGuest Pay continues to grow with 97 agreements in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 35 agreements in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. rGuest Buy is also gaining traction just last week, we announced the general availability of the self-service kiosk solution that extends point of sale reach, improves guest service and reduces staffing needs. Research shows that over 60% of consumers would use a kiosk to place orders and pay for food in restaurants and food service venues. We are confident our kiosk solutions will help us more successfully address high volume food service operations a large and growing hospitality segment. And as we mentioned previously Compass Group North America began live trials with two large multinational organizations, one in the financial services sector and one in the life sciences sector, these trials are progressing well. We will continue to invest for growth in our solutions including key enhancements to our iconic offering that keep them market leading and further facilitate the eventual migration to the rGuest platform. Current and potential customers are comfortable buying solutions like LMS, Visual One and InfoGenesis because they see the potential value available to them, as they will later shift to rGuest platform based solutions. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Janine Seebeck who will review our financial results before we open the lines to questions. Janine?
Janine Seebeck: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter fiscal 2017 total revenue was $31 million representing a 13% increase from total net revenues of $27.5 million in the comparable prior year period. Products revenue, which is comprised of hardware and on premise software license sales increased 8% to $9.5 million and represented 31% of total revenue during the quarter. This reflects an increase in hardware sales associated with our proprietary software so does the subscription based service, as well as increases in hardware replacement sales for iconic products. It is important to note that while subscription based license sales yield initial revenue of lower margin hardware. They provide us with higher margin subscription revenues in future periods. Support, maintenance and subscription revenue or recurring revenue remained flat at $14.9 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while our subscription based revenue grew by 31% and accounted for approximately 20% of support, maintenance and subscription revenue compared to 16% in the fiscal 2016 first quarter. In the quarter we experienced a decline in our remarketed support revenue resulting in the overall year-over-year flat recurring revenue. We expect that the support, maintenance and subscription revenue for the year will show annual growth trends in the 4% to 6% range. Professional service revenue grew 72% to $6.5 million compared to $3.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 reflecting a better utilization of our services resources. rGuest platform revenues comprised 5% of total fiscal 2017 first quarter revenue. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold increased approximately 33% or $14.8 million. The increase is largely due to the start of amortizing software development cost as rGuest Stay reached general availability. And total gross profit fell 1.3% to $16.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, while gross profit margin fell by 740 basis points to 72.3%, driven by the impact of the software amortization costs and the growth in lower margin professional service and hardware revenue. Looking at operating expenses, which included product development, selling and marketing, general, administrative and depreciation expense, the first quarter saw a 9.4% year-over-year increase to $18 million. Operating expenses represented 58% of total net revenues versus 60% in the prior year period. As expected product development expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 9.4% year-over-year to $6.9 million and represented 22% as a percentage of total revenue in the first quarter of both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. Product development expense continues to be driven by our ongoing investments in resource related to both rGuest and iconic product enhancements to expand the customer experience across our installed base, as well as our future offerings with existing and new customers. Sales and marketing costs increased 26% year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of increasing commission expense in line with booking achievements, specifically subscription based booking. This total contract value increased 250% year-over-year and to a lesser extent due to the timing of trade shows and marketing initiatives. General and administrative expenses decreased 6% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily due to our continued efforts to improve efficiencies and streamline back office functions. We reported an operating loss of $2.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to an operating loss of $277,000 in the prior year period. Net loss for the first quarter was $2.3 million or $0.10 loss per diluted share compared to a net loss of $200,000 or $0.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased approximately $700,000 in the first quarter to $441,000 versus $1.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016 was $55.3 million compared to $60.3 million at March 31, 2016. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $3.7 million of spending related to ongoing product development investments. Net cash used in operations was $1.0 million, a decrease of approximately $846,000 versus the prior year period. Adjusted for non-recurring items net adjusted cash used by operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $530,000 compared to net adjusted cash used by operations of $1.6 million in the prior year period. In terms of NOLs, we have approximately $185 million on our books for which we can attribute a full valuation allowance and which will help us remain liable for only taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Looking ahead to the balance of fiscal 2017, we continue to expect full year revenue growth in excess of the market rate of growth. And I expect our bookings will continue to favor subscription type contract allowing us to take the hardware and professional services revenue up front and spread the software license revenue over the term. As such we currently expect fiscal 2017 full year revenue will be approximately $132 million to $136 million reflecting an estimated 10% to 13% growth over fiscal 2016. As it relates to margins is important to remember that we have been recording development costs for our solutions such as rGuest Stay a software development cost on the balance sheet. However as these solutions begin to reach general availability as was the case in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We begin to amortize these development costs in a linear fashion on our income statement. That will be the case with rGuest Buy as well which we announced last week that also entered general availability. As such we expect gross margins in the low 30% [ph] range due to the non-cash developed technology expense coming off the balance sheet. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we're expecting to end fiscal 2017 with more than double the $4.3 million of adjusted EBITDA realized in fiscal 2016. Given our desire and that of our customers to advance the development of the rGuest platform, we will look to continue making investments in product development as we bring to market additional features and functions that will enable us to address the growing number of markets sooner. As such we anticipate total product development capital investment in fiscal 2017 will be in the $10 million to $15 million range compared to fiscal 2016 total capital investment of approximately $21 million. Our continued product investments may also – may lead to modestly negative free cash flow in fiscal 2017 with a projected end of year cash balance of greater than $55 million. As we mentioned on our prior call, we are also pursuing several larger than average size engagements that may require us to further accelerate the product roadmap or invest in additional operating expenses ahead of recognized revenue in fiscal 2017. In summary, we continue to make progress on returning Agilysys to balance top and bottom-line growth and profitability. And will look to bring that into greater focus over the balance of fiscal 2017 as we continue to prioritize our efforts behind the most significant drivers of engagement growth and demand. With that, let me turn the call back to Jim for some quick comments before we open the call for your questions. Jim?
Jim Dennedy: Thank you, Janine. Before we turn to your questions I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the very talented and dedicated team at Agilysys. Their work truly drives our success. And I want to thank our many customers and partners who entrust us with their business. Secondly, Agilysys will continue to invest for growth operate efficiently and engage your customers widely. I remain confident about your investment in innovation. Agilysys will be a formidable competitor a better partner for our customers, remain an interesting company for our employees and a profitable investment for our shareholders. With that, let's turn the call over to Candice for questions. Candice.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee of Sidoti. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: Yes. Hi, good job on the quarter. In terms of – I guess to start with in terms of the faster growth in professional services. I know products is more related to I guess some of the new product offerings that you have, but maybe can you comment on professional services what’s going on there.
Janine Seebeck: Sure, this is Janine. So I think in the quarter what we saw was definitely some clearing of some of the backlog as we started to grow our bookings overtime. You've seen the number in professional services going up quarter-over-quarter sequentially. I think we definitely saw that this quarter was a little bit higher than kind of what we expect the run rate to be. But definitely we’re expecting professional services to be at a higher run rate than what you would have seen in Q1 of last year as we continue to close more of the subscription deals and be able to take the hardware and the professional services upfront.
Allen Klee: Okay. Then I – go ahead, sorry.
Jim Dennedy: Just to explain the business a bit as we sell demand for our solutions whether its a premise or a subscription based. You're building a backlog of professional services demand that we need to address and what we saw in the first quarter was some changes that are under leadership of Ravi Angadi and Rob Jackson our services organization, we were able to get greater resource utilization out of the team. We think that their greater utilization in terms of billable hours per month is going to be sustained throughout the year and that we should see based on our previous recorded demand in our bookings data continued higher levels of professional services revenue for the rest of the balance of fiscal year. We did have an outsized bump in Q1 as the changes that they made in their organization helped retire more backlogs, but now we're getting down to a more normalized level of just a higher level of service revenues in every quarter we see going forward.
Allen Klee: Okay, thank you. And then for subscription revenue you mentioned that it was the SaaS grew but something else declined to result in the whole thing flat, but I missed what you said about the other thing that declined and then did you say the whole segment you expect to be up 4% to 6%.
Janine Seebeck: That's correct. So Allen basically we have within our support. It's obviously made up of our annual recurring proprietary maintenance as well as remarketed support, which we book as a net upfront revenue. So those are things like third-party hardware contracts we sell to some of our third-party hardware contract maintenance contracts. That line item actually declined year-over-year as we’re moving away from more of – less of that I series LMS on premise. So that line item, the decline in that basically offset the growth we saw from a subscription based revenue in the quarter, but I am expecting even with that line having some impact that will still hit 4% to 6% for the year for the whole line item.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then as we think about margins and I know in the near-term product and professional as you're getting these subscription products you get more of an impact upfront, but how do you think about the timing of how those margins kind of change over – how that kind of influx overtime.
Janine Seebeck: So Allen I think what you're asking is obviously we've got items coming off the balance sheet, it’s about $31 million that came off in Q1 related to Stay and then Buy will have another $10 million or so that’s coming off in Q2 that will start to amortize. That obviously has an impact on margins it’s a five-year amortization. So you have to assume that it’s going to come in. We do assume that it will take a little bit of time for revenue to ramp to offset that and that probably won’t happen up until the second half of our fiscal 2018. These start to see that normalize. So I think there's definitely a timing impact as we start to show the costs technically ahead of kind of the key parts of the revenue as we’ve now gone generally available. Does that answer your questions.
Allen Klee: Yes, thanks. Then you talked about the dollar amount – the total dollar amount of total contracted value of subscription business that was up 250% year-over-year. Do we know what the actual – what the dollar amount of the contract value is?
Jim Dennedy: Yes. We do, we haven't disclosed. We haven't disclosed those numbers. We haven't made those numbers on a quarterly basis available generally.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then of the new rGuest products, could you give us a sense. You did a good job of kind of what's been coming out and stuff just going forward over the next year or so kind of what we could look forward to?
Jim Dennedy: In terms of product revenue growth or product revenue contribution from the rGuest products.
Allen Klee: Or kind of – new things that you're thinking about.
Jim Dennedy: I see, in terms of new developments.
Allen Klee: Yes.
Jim Dennedy: The new dev – yes, I think when you look at the portfolio today it’s – we’re essentially focused and we spent a lot of time getting the Buy, Seat and Pay products outs. The Stay product is the central investment that we then recently released for limited and select service. It's now evolving primarily Stay and Buy going forward. So if you think about the evolution of Stay, it’s addressing a market that's now bigger than Limited and Select Service, while Limited and Select Service is a big market even if you discount the US alone, as we make a continued enhancements to rGuest Stay, that include full service hotel that opens up a larger market. Full service hotels and chains that gets you into the Tier 1 chain hotel market. And then we start encroaching in the territory that we already serve in the resorts and the casinos. So the near-term opportunities over the next let's say 12 months we’ll be introducing new lets say feature sets within Stay to address greater and greater market opportunity for us in the core hotel market. The same is generally true for rGuest Buy, rGuest Buy utilizes the backend engine of InfoGenesis. So our customers don't need to do anything if they've already been on InfoGenesis to use the rGuest Buy technology. What rGuest Buy technology does is it presents a new terminal phase to the users first focusing on let's say the guest services associate so a new terminal itself or the guest service. And at the same time creating this kiosk product that will allow for a guest facing interaction with the ordering system or the menu system. So within the Buy product, there's really going to be sort of two introductions. Introduction one will be opening up new opportunities where we can install guest facing ordering components that will do two things. One we think it helps order demand increase and secondly it takes meaningful expense off the floor by not having a guest service attendant or cashier at every terminal. That's going to dramatically help our customers particularly in the high volume managed food service segment. The second thing we're doing is by allowing this interface to the backend engine of InfoGenesis is again around the kiosk concept create more opportunity for our casino customers, our hotel customers to place points of interaction for guests self ordering more abundantly throughout the property. That will expand generally the addressable market because if he can put for $2,500 a terminal out there on the floor someplace, you remove probably more than 10 times that expense and a guest service associate attending an intended terminal. You also increase the frequency of traffic that's going to be order placing. Now the last part of this is then replacing basically the InfoGenesis terminal at the restaurant itself and we look at that evolution of both the kiosk guest self ordering and then a terminal replacement over time, our product introductions around the rGuest Buy that will happen over the next 12 months as well. So that’s sort of the progression in terms of like net new products around that it's largely going to be those introductions on the central Stay and Buy. But then adding more knowledge or insight around the analytics products, so that operators can see what is happening not only in their day to day operations, but also how to use the guest consumption data that they're collecting to drive greater recruitment, more wallet share and deliver an overall greater guest experience at their properties. So those are the essential areas where we see new product investment or evolution over the next 12 months.
Allen Klee: That's helpful. Thank you. And then last quarter you talked about that there could potentially be some transformational type of opportunities out there. How do you think about that today?
Jim Dennedy: So these are the large deals that we track in our pipeline, but we hold them out. Jim Walker and I sort of hold them out separately and we talk about those in our weekly cadence calls as a separate kind of large deal step up and change opportunities within the business. We have about a half a dozen of those on which we're working. And through the summer I mean it's only been two months since our last call. So over the last two months, some of those projects have advanced materially. Others based on summer vacationing and customers just generally not being available through the summer. The projects are still there. We expect activity around those projects to pick up later this month and into the fall, but again those large opportunities remain available to us. It's continuing to address their needs any special configuration requirements or – these larger enterprises they have complex networks and its understanding what we need in order to have line of sight from the end point out through their proprietary networks to our data center to make the whole solution operate effectively for them. So those large deals are still there. We still anticipate that landing several of these will cause needle moving changes in our business. Now that said I also want to describe how some of these enterprises work. Some of these enterprises work in a way where you land a deal and you get the entire enterprise deal. And they'll make a wholesale shift and what they use for their point of sale operations right away. Others tend to give you let's say a hunting license if you will and they give you the stamp of approval and then you need to go out and target each one of the franchisees in their universe and secure business with the franchisees separately in order to secure all those properties. The ones who are likely to move first or at least the deals that are furthest along right now are the ones that are more decentralized decision making franchisee based. And those are the ones who just happen to have spent more activity throughout the summer. And ones that we think we'll get approval on sooner rather than later but that also means it's not going to be a large enterprise deal announcement. It’s just going to give us the opportunity to then go sell these franchise or groups of owners on doing business with it with Agilysys. That's the way that big deals and the large businesses is shaping up.
Allen Klee: Okay. Thank you. And then in your beginning text you talked about some competitive wins and could you maybe just go over a little bit of kind of why you were able to displace the incumbent what do you think that you had versus them.
Jim Dennedy: Sure. I think it really boils down to first half service and support. Our ability to deliver a higher level of support in terms of business support. We need new terminals. We have a surge in business. We have an event upcoming. We need you to be responsive to our business needs. And we’re able to address that more quickly than our competitors. The second area around support is when there are outages like there often are in this type of technology is that our ability to respond to outages more quickly and get them back into operating service faster is also something where we excel relative to our competitors. That said the underlying technology itself whether its InfoGenesis compared to any of the other providers point of sale services in the space or LMS or Visual One. The product capabilities themselves are by default superior to our competitors, but I think what we're hearing is being a more responsive partner has actually been more important to them in their decision making to switch than the feature set availability that might be superior in InfoGenesis or LMS or Pay or what have you. Once they begin using the product, they then understand why the response and services can be so high because the product is just easier to use and more suitable to hospitality operations. So that’s the feedback that we're hearing from why we are winning these competitive displacements.
Allen Klee: Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter.
Jim Dennedy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Phil Bernard of Eilers. Your line is now open.
Phil Bernard: Hi guys, thanks for taking my call. Well done on a good quarter.
Jim Dennedy: Thank you.
Phil Bernard: I will try and make this quick, I’ll start with the support and subscription revenue. You guys provide some more information on terminals installed and rooms managed for POS and your Property Management Systems. I was wondering if you'd be able to speak to the mix between licensed and subscription, terminals and rooms and how you see that – how that has evolved over the last year and a half and how you see that changing going forward and maybe provide some color on yield as well.
Janine Seebeck: So Phil, it’s a great question. I would tell you from a terminal and revenue perspective it’s still because of the bulk obviously it’s still pretty much legacy on premise, where it's probably still much heavier weighted 80% to 90% depending of that would be on premise. Obviously more of the new deals that are coming in and moving to be installed are definitely a heavier shift towards subscription. We haven't given that full data yet, but I think that something that as we continue to transform into subscription business. And we see more and more of the terminals and the rooms come in that fashion. I think we'll be able to start sharing that data with you. I think today it is pretty heavy – heavily weighted although I would tell you the new opportunities and new logos right are definitely much more heavily shifted at least 60, 40, maybe even a little bit more than that towards that base.
Phil Bernard: Got it, got it. Okay, okay. Good news going forward. And then my last question, an update on your progress with the Drury install and maybe some commentary on how that's going and what the response has been from them.
Jim Dennedy: The Drury installs are going extremely well. I think we have two properties live and are working on a third, the rollout schedule that we had planned for them. We're still on track for that. They – we always felt like it was going to go somewhat slow in the beginning and then the pace would pick up. The feedback that we're hearing particularly from the lead or the head of IT for Drury has said this has been the smoothest PMS replacement that they've ever seen. Not only from doing the record counts and reducing the number of records down to a more sensible level of unique records in their database, so they went from several million down to a couple of million and through that transformation we identified many records that were duplicates of the same individual, but then once we've transferred those records over into our new rGuest PMS, rGuest Stay that transfer of records, the transfer of information, the migration of full reservations in to Stay has gone far smoother than they ever anticipated. And we think that’s all good news. It's a reflection not only of the technology, but I think it's a reflection of our people. Our people really understand not just the technology, but how an operator needs to function. And so when they think about data migration is it just moving a thing from cell A1 to cell A1 in the new concept to the new system it’s understanding what a reservation record looks like. So you can move the whole thing over and make it make sense in the context of the new system. And I think that is a testament to the quality of the people we have in the organization.
Phil Bernard: Got it, got it. I appreciate it. So service continues to be a source of competitive advantage for you guys it seems.
Jim Dennedy: It always is. When I look at an enterprise product, there is two components to the enterprise product and it’s the developed technology plus the services. But within the services, there’s three central pieces of services that you’re delivering. It's the support services for the use of the product, it’s the professional services for the implementation, the understanding the how to run your business on the product and then its the corporate services all around provisioning and getting the right products at the right time to you that the invoicing is correct that it's easy to do business with. So you think about an enterprise product out of the four components I highlighted three of them are service related. And of all you focus on is the technology you're missing three of the four things that an enterprise customer relies on a provider for support for the entire solution and it's all around services. So you're absolutely right that by focusing on our service and how we distinguish ourselves with a product that is superior in the marketplace because of our engineering services being so high quality. It makes for an easier sale and greater growth rates in the business.
Phil Bernard: Got it. So quarter backing off of that point and moving over to a specific vertical gaming, there seems to be – there continues to be some growth within that sector. However, it would probably come from competitive replacements do you see yourselves in a position to be able to grow the business within that vertical.
Jim Dennedy: We do. It's not only from competitive displacement, but it's also through innovative thinking on how we can help operators address more of the non-gaming spend that's going on at their property. When we talk about the rGuest Buy technology or we talk about InfoGenesis Flex the mobile tablet. It's giving our operators more product or more solution endpoints from us. So we're basically expanding the footprint of what you would traditionally think would be available on the number of point of sale endpoints per venue and sort of almost doubling that. And so if you then double that, but you give it to let’s say a guest service associate poolside or in an area where walking around and serving – servicing the guest is the situation versus the guest being seated at a specific table and you do a lot of back and forth. What we've noticed and I talked to our friends that at the – property themselves, so when I go to the MGM properties or when I stay at Vdara I actually ask the server is this more effective for you, how does it work for you. And what they're telling us and what they see in their venue revenues that it makes them 25% to 30% more efficient in terms of order delivery, order taking and the guests are happier because instead of like everybody coming to the well and putting drinks all at the same time that guest services associate can take three or four orders and be sending those as they're ordered to the well. So there's not a huge queue up by the time the guest service associate gets back the orders in many cases are already available for the take back to the floor. So it increases order flow, he gets the drinks to the guest more quickly and the overall experience is higher. So through that we are expanding some of the footprint that otherwise would be more limited by offering them innovation and service that then uses our technology to provide that delivery. Now that said, that's expanding the addressable market within the market we already own. But because of our ability to do that we then can explain this is why you should use Agilysys technology versus a competing technology and we’re winning the competitive displacement at the same time. So that what's happening within the business in the competitive dynamics and why we think growth in gaming remains available to us.
Phil Bernard: Got it, got it, great. Well, that is it for me. Thanks, guys.
Jim Dennedy: Thank you.
Janine Seebeck: Thanks, Phil.
Operator: Thank you and that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dennedy for closing remarks.
Jim Dennedy: Thank you, Candice and thank you all for your interest in our Company.

Reconciliations to GAAP metrics are provided in the financial section of the press release issued earlier today. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kaufman, Chairman of the Board of the Agilysys.
Michael Kaufman: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you to everyone for joining us to review our fiscal 2017 second quarter results. Joining me on the call today are Jim Dennedy; Janine Seebeck; and Larry Steinberg our Chief Technology Officer. Before I turn the call over to Jim, Larry and Janine for the commentary I want to spend few minutes reviewing some of the Board's thoughts. Revenues we issued two weeks ago. As we noted, the Board has commenced a search for a new CEO and is confident they will be able to do so in a reasonable amount of time. Until the successor is named, Jim Dennedy will continue to serve a CEO. The Board is conducting a thorough search casting a broad net to recruit executive leaders of high growth, top performing companies you would all recognize. We have received tremendous interest from highly talented executives who are keenly aware and excited by the opportunity at Agilysys. Our products and vision that we've developed are respected and admired by people outside and across the industry. As a result, we are in an excellent position to recruit a world-class executive to bring our vision to fruition. In the meantime, we continue to move forward aggressively executing on our strategy. While we are still working through some of the fine details with management, the Board is committed to accelerating planned future investments in our products, sales and marketing efforts; and our overall infrastructure into the current fiscal year to bring our capabilities in line with the opportunities we have to aggressively expand our business with large-scale hotel operators and in international markets. We want the products finish today, we want to win these major new customers today, and we want to be the fastest growing company in hospitality today. We also announced separately Janine Seebeck has informed us of her decision to resign as CFO effective November 18th, as she has accepted a CFO position with the private company that is not a competitor to Agilysys. Tony Pritchett who joined Agilysys in 2012 as Controller of the Retail Solutions Group, and he was subsequently served as the Company's Controller as well as in his current role a Senior Director of Operations will assume the role of Interim CFO following Janine's departure at the end of next week. Tony and the rest of the finance and accounting team are highly capable and experienced and the Board is confident that they will service well during this management transition. I want to personally thank Jim Dennedy for the services at Agilysys because of the work on the Company strategic initiatives we are currently positioned with the most significant opportunities for growth in our company’s recent history. The Board of Directors is committed to supporting the Company and all of our team members at the highest level. As part of this commitment, the Board believes that now is the optimal time to bring in a new CEO, one that brings to Agilysys the knowledge based, experienced and track record of success in managing a high growth global business. The Board believes that we have a real opportunity to double our business over the next several years. By building on the word accomplished by Jim and Janine and all the team members of Agilysys, the Company is now positioned to dramatically accelerate our growth around our three priorities point-of-sale, property management systems and payments or the PPPs as we call them. As a very significant shareholder in Agilysys, I very much appreciate the commitment from the full Board of Directors. Speaking on behalf of the Board, I know we are all extremely excited by the opportunities available to the Company today, and we are fully supportive of investing and accelerating and teams efforts to achieve these goals. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim for some comments. Jim?
Jim Dennedy: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon everyone. While Larry will review the status of our product initiatives and Janine will provide a detail review of the second fiscal quarter of 2017, I’ll provide important business highlights and an overview of our go-to-market strategy. One of our most initiatives is to drive success and winning a new opportunities and increasing our rate of competitive takeout. No matter the competitor Agilysys has deep solutions knowhow and overall capabilities to compete and win. Evidence of our success is our consistent level of competitive takeout. We have seven this quarter and expect the trend of four to six competitive takeouts per quarter that we have experienced for the past six quarters to continue for the balance of fiscal 2017. Going forward, this is an area that I am confident will continue to be a key growth opportunity for Agilysys. We also continue to make headwind with new customer wins. In the second quarter, we secured 32 contracts with new customers compared to 30 new consumer wins in the prior year period. The total contract value for subscription-based booking for these new customers increased 25% compared to the new deals in the second quarter of last year and represented over 50% of new customers for the quarter. And on a six months basis, the total contract value for subscription-based bookings for both the new rGuest platform and our iconic solution increased by 135%, compared to the first six months of fiscal 2016. Subscription revenue in the fiscal 2017 second quarter comprised 12% of total revenue, which is the highest percentage on a quarterly basis we have ever achieved and compares favorably to the 9% of subscription revenue and the overall revenue mix in last year second quarter. This ongoing increase in the percentage of subscription revenues and our overall revenue mix and our ability to create deeper and broader connections to our customers is enabling us the base of recurring revenue that will recognize in the coming quarters. With respect to our install based, we ended the second quarter with more than 37,000 point-of-sale end points in total, up 23% from same period last year and, more than 245,000 hotel rooms are now being managed by our lodging solutions, up 5% from the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and representing 5% of the approximately 5 million hotel rooms across the United States. As it relates our solutions, we have made great progress in bringing the rGuest platform and select applications to market. The rGuest adoption rate among new customer wins is growing and I believe this will continue. As Michael noted, the Board is committed to ramping up to the Company's efforts around our product offering including our rGuest Stay our rGuest Buy and our rGuest Pay. In late to July, we announced the general availability of our rGuest Buy, our ground breaking Self-Service Kiosk Solution that extends point-of-sale reach, improved guest service and reduces staff demand. Those solutions as part of the Agilysys continuing market penetration in as food and beverage menus that for prepackaged and bar coded food items, a large and growing across several hospitality segments. rGuest Buy is currently deployed more than 40 customers sites across the country including corporate cafeteria at a top five U.S. banks, a top 40 U.S. law firms, one of the nation's largest technology companies and a national financial services firm. Besides from rGuest, we have made significant progress with our iconic lodging specific solutions LMS and Visual One. LMS continues to deliver significant revenue growth including hosted element as a service and recently we went live with our first customer with Visual One property management as a service. In September, we announced the latest version of InfoGenesis Point-Of-Sale approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, InfoGenesis Point-Of-Sale version 4.4.8., continues to demonstrate Agilysys' hospitality provision leadership, support for AMV and a series of innovative enhancement design to boost efficiency, improve the user experience and increase revenue. We also recently released several important new features to our Stratton Warren System inventory and procurement solution. Stratton Warren, SWS Version 9.1 including number of innovative enhancements design to boost efficiency, increase revenue and improve compliance. With regard to our sales force, we have made strategic investments in our resources in this area including an increase to our overall sales capacity, establishing a strategic account management function and growing our international operations as we look to expand our global presence. We currently have 32 [indiscernible] in sales people. Strategic account management or [indiscernible] and service the opportunities we see with the large Tier I chain hotels. I am also pleased with our continued growth in the corporate and travel gaining markets. We see significant opportunities to continue to grow on market share to competitive takeout as well as through expansion. Marketing expansion as the emphasis on non-gaining revenue increases. Our bookings in this vertical grew 115% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 versus the prior year period and on a trailing 12 months basis grew by 44%. In hotel market, we are leveraging the migration towards next generation hotel solutions and providing increased adoption for our iconic solution including Visual One hosted. We have 15 new customer wins during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, now recorded total revenue bookings value of approximately $2.3 million. Importantly, we remained confident that our ability to secure agreement with Tier 1 branded hotel operators who lead to a significant expansion of revenue in this core vertical. Looking at the food service and the restaurant university stadium and healthcare vertical, which combined represents approximately 26% of our total revenues. We see healthy fundamentals and the potential for significant growth around key areas such as self-services with rGuest buy kiosks, growth in tablets with InfoGenesis Flex and other initiatives. Our focus on enabling our clients to better leverage the guest lifecycle has resulted in steady growth through the competitive takeouts, subscription introduction, winning the customers and cross-selling and up-selling. The 10% revenue growth and 46% year-over-year growth in subscription-based revenue in the fiscal 2017 second quarter provides strong evidence as we moving in the right direction and making progress against these key objectives. In summary, I believe Agilysys continues to make progress as we focus our resources on the highest value opportunities in our chosen end markets and manage the business for the long-term to deliver sustainable value to our employees, customers and our shareholders. Current potential customers are comfortable buying our iconic solutions like LMS, Visual One and InfoGenesis because they see the current value these solutions represent, as well as the long-term value potential as they plan to shift to rGuest Platform based solutions. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Larry, who will provide an update on our technology solutions and development. Larry?
Larry Steinberg: Thank you, Jim. We thought it would be helpful this afternoon to provide an overview on where we stand with our technology solution as it pertains to the market opportunities we're addressing now or seeking to address going forward. A little earlier, Michael Kaufman noted that the Board is solidly behind the vision to execute on the opportunities we have today that can help to double our business and that to achieve the goal, we’re going to accelerate near-term spend and product development infrastructure. I’ll provide some perspectives on what that means in terms of the key product development initiatives, we’re focused on. Let me start with a look at value proposition, our hospitality software platform provides to current and potential customers. What Agilysys has developed is a hospitality software program that is very unique in the industry. We’re enabling our customers the centralized guest information across multiple application, which provides them with the better real-time understanding of their guest needs and the opportunity to have to service them, and ultimately create added opportunities for revenue increased level of customer satisfaction. Our platform provides the opportunity for operators to service their guest better in the more ways than never before. It also provides us with the ability to deliver new applications to better address the dynamic nature of the guest experience. In addition, the platform provides a reach and seamless integration between our iconic solutions and rGuest applications as well as between our partners and our customers' application. By offering this type of open platform, we’re making more data available on hospitality guest to our customers, our partners and to ourselves than ever before and this has a tremendous amount of value in the marketplace. Looking at some specific products now, we continue to see consistent success for the rGuest Pay solution as we have secured 197 new agreements with the rGuest Pay products in the first six months fiscal 2017. As rGuest Pay fully supports both point-to-point encryption and the EMV compliance, it offers our customers added security and peace of mind. rGuest Pay supported by our full product suites which accepts payment including our iconic and rGuest solution. I think the single payment interface because all of our products enhance with our efficiencies which is significant benefit for our go-to-market strategy. Turning to rGuest Buy, the rGuest Buy kiosk is live in many sites and we add additional sites every week. We believe its ability to provide critical self-service functionality to our pause offering is a key distinguishing in characteristics that will keep out momentum going. This big near-term opportunity for rGuest Buy in the managed foodservice market, as the self-service capability helps our customers reduce expenses by eliminating staffing from main point sale terminals. Since we first introduced rGuest Buy, customers have highlighted not just the easy to use customer interface, but as important they’re noting that guest workflows are improving once the rGuest Buy kiosk is introduced. This increases guest satisfaction and revenue. In terms of rGuest Pay, we continue to make progress rolling up the solution with limited service and small chain customers. A little up to food chain, we are aggressively rolling up stay with our larger chain customer which will continue through the next calendar year. rGuest Pay product focus is on continuing to add features that will help open up new opportunities in the next level of the hotel segment. In order to penetrate the large hotel chain market with InfoGenesis, we are adding capabilities to the solution that can end up this chain international operations and the broad enterprise oversize they require. This work is at the center of the accelerated investments we are making now and planning for in the near term. This one showed our sales team equipped with the best solution now on when that we know large chain operators trust and want, which is critical to securing new market wins and share. We are confident that InfoGenesis SaaS solution will prove itself potentially new our chain of hotel operators. That's the way we are mapping out our current product development and hope this is helpful for the understanding of the progress we have made to-date with our technology in the near-term development plans we are focused on. With that, let me turn the call over to Janine.
Janine Seebeck: Thank you, Larry, and good afternoon everyone. Our second quarter fiscal 2017 total revenue was $32.7 million, representing a 10% increase from total net revenues of $29.6 million in the comparable prior year period. Product net revenues which is comprised of remarketed product including hardware and software, and on-premise proprietary software license sales increased 8% to $10 million, and represents 33% of total revenue during the quarter compared to $9.9 million and 34% of total revenue during the prior year period. The increase reflects at every marketed product sales for iconic products as well as increased new customer hardware sales associated with our proprietary software sold as a service. Remarketed product revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in proprietary software license revenue in line with the strategic shift in mix to subscription-based services revenue. As we have highlighted before, it is important to note that while subscription-based license sales initially carry a lower margin remarketed product revenue component, they will drive the growth in higher margin subscription revenues in future periods. Importantly, approximately 23% of product revenues in the second quarter fiscal 2017 was related to subscription agreement, compare to approximately 13% in the prior year quarter. Support maintenance and subscription revenue or recurring revenues also grew by 8% to $15.9 million compare to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by a 46% increase in our subscription-based revenue, which accounted for 24% of support maintenance and subscription revenue, compare to 18% in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. Going forward, we expect support maintenance and subscription revenue for the second half of the year will show similar growth trends to Q2 and that we will end the year in a 4% to 6% year-over-year growth rate. Professional services revenue grew 21% to $6 million compared to $5 million in the second quarter fiscal 2016, reflecting a greater utilization of our services resources in support of new installation. I would like to point out that the revenue performance in the services, implementation, integration and installation services for proprietary and remarketed products has grown over 42% in the first half of fiscal 2017, compared to the first half of fiscal 2016. And as it relates to the rGuest platform, these revenues comprised 7% of total fiscal 2017 second quarter revenue. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold increased approximately 39% to $16.8 million. This increase contributed to a 10% decline in the total gross profit from $17.6 million to $15.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and gross profit margin sales by 1,075 basis points to 48.6%. This decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily driven by the impact of an incremental 1.9 million of developed technology amortization costs as a result of search in rGuest products being placed into service in the first half of 2017. Gross margins in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were also impacted by the greater mix of lower margin upfront remarketed product revenue and lower gross profit margin for professional services, reflecting upfront investments in our professional service team to support the growth and both proprietary software license and subscription services revenue. We continue to expect gross margins will be in the low-50% range due to the non-cash developed technology expense coming up for balance sheet and the continued shift in revenue towards more subscription-based sales. Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2017 were 17.8 million, which includes product development, selling and marketing, general, administrative and depreciation expense. These were consistent with second quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating expenses represented 54% of total net revenues versus 60% in the prior year period. As expected, product development expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased 2% year-over-year to 6.9 million and represented 21% of total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 versus 23% in fiscal 2016, driven by our ongoing investment and resources related to both rGuest and iconic product enhancements to expand the customer experience across our installed based. Sales and marketing costs decreased 4% year-over-year to 5.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of approximately $400,000 decline in employee related expenses due to the timing of a large subscription-based booking during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This was partially offset by increased spend in advertising and promotion of approximately 200,000 in order to accelerate the growth in lead acquisitions and pipeline velocity in support of the future revenue growth. General and administrative expenses decreased 1% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily due to our continued efforts to improve efficiencies and streamline back office functions. This slides to an operating loss of 2.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to an operating loss of 379,000 in the prior year period. Net loss for the second quarter was 2.4 million or $0.11 loss per diluted share compared to a net loss of 370,000 or $0.02 loss per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased approximately 200,000 in the second quarter to 1.3 million versus 1.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2016 was 51.6 million, compared to 60.6 million at March 31, 2016. The decrease in cash reflects approximately 6.6 million of spending related to ongoing product development investments. Net cash used in operations was 184,000 compared to the prior year period of 224,000 of net cash used in operation. Adjusted for non-recurring items, net adjusted cash provided by operations for the first half of fiscal 2017 was 287,000, compared to 150,000 in the prior year period. In terms of NOLs, we continue to have approximately 190 million on our books for which we can attribute a full valuation allowance and which will help us remain liable for only taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Looking ahead to the balance of fiscal 2017, we continue to expect to full year revenue growth in excess of the market rate of growth. And I expect that our booking will continue to favor subscription-based contract that's continuing the trend we saw last quarter and this quarter of realizing remarketed product and professional service revenue upfront, so that we can subsequently recognized the software license revenue over the term of the contract. As such, we are reiterating our expectations for fiscal 2017 full year revenue of between $132 million and $136 million or 10% to 13% growth over fiscal 2016. We also continue to expect gross margin for fiscal 2017 to be in the low 50% range, which reflects the impact of higher cost of goods sold related to the recent general availability of first generation version of rGuest product, and a continued shift in revenue towards most subscription-based sale. In addition, while we were on track to achieve our outlook for adjusted EBITDA to double in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 adjusted EBITDA, given some uncertainties regarding the full scope of the accelerated investment in products, sales and marketing and infrastructure over the next several quarters as well as the timing of the several large potential agreement discussed on the call this afternoon. We are not at this time able to provide a forecast for fiscal 2017 adjusted EBITDA. In summary, we are continuing to demonstrate that our operating model and our platform is working for our clients and then our investment returns are paying off. And as well as company we are proud of this quarter performance and in particular we are proud of the growth in key underlying business driver. We take a long-term disciplined view on delivering excellent customer experiences and strong execution while remaining focused on food and expense management and return focus investment, so we can accelerate our top line growth and move forward towards generating positive cash flow and profitability. On a personal note, I want to take this opportunity to thanks everyone at Agilysys. I have very much enjoyed working with such a talented and supportive team. Agilysys has a deep and experienced team finance team led by Tony Pritchett and I am confident that Tony and his team will serve Agilysys well during this transition period. With that, let's open the call for your questions. Chelsie?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of Phil Bernard with Eilers Krejcik Gaming. Your line is now open.
Phil Bernard: Just a couple quick questions, I was wondering, if you could provide a little more detail on the mixed stream license and subscription terminals or mix between those two respective your POS terminals and your PMS terms managed?
Janine Seebeck: So, I'll take that question. So, I think we're still looking pretty consistent to what we disclosed before. I think we are still looking pretty heavily with the on-premise being the larger piece of those. We've talked about a little bit, but you know we're starting to see the new logos coming in and they're greater than 50%. But obviously as you know we are looking at 90 percent-ish that are kind of on-premise today's, it's going to take while for that to catch up and mix. So it's kind of pretty heavily weighted on premise to that while we're obviously continuing to see those subscripting bookings increased in the new logo, which is very positive.
Phil Bernard: Okay, great. And then last one, you've guided for margin in a low 50% range. Obviously the current quarter was little below that, primarily due to I am assuming the modernization of developed technology coming through product sales. Do you anticipate that to rebound with a lot of that amortize within the quarter? Was there large a one-time amortization charge in the quarter? Or do you anticipate product sales margin to remain a little more subdued as it was in this quarter?
Janine Seebeck: So, I think it will be right around that 50% in that range. The [debt track] is coming in. We say there is about 1.9 incremental that’s kind of going to continue from a run rate perspective slightly higher than that, but they were a couple of other items impacting in the quarter. We had an additional investment from a professional services staff perspective as we’re ramping up as there is little bit more overhead costs there. And then there was obviously additionally a little bit more heavy weight towards the hardware and low margin hardware upfront as opposed to the on-premise license right with that, just to that we saw a little bit more of that in the quarter. I think that while we came in at that kind of 48.6, I think for the year we’re right about 50.4%. And so, I think we’re going to come back and it will probably be right in that range just because it normalized for the subscription group, as well as for the professional services teams being ramped up and utilized.
Phil Bernard: Okay, great. And then lastly, I know early in the call Larry mentioned an increased focused on -- I’m trying to update and maybe make some changes, you need to some of your customers on the property management side. How do you anticipate R&D for the remainder of the year and current levels of the first half or accelerate even further?
Janine Seebeck: Yes. So, I think the reason that we are not giving adjusted EBITDA guidance as we’re obviously going through in assessing what is required to meet the market needs of certain things that are going on. And so, I think while I can't give you exact guidance, I definitely believe the cost from a product perspective both OpEx and CapEx from a sales and marketing perspective, and the way that Jim talk about the sales force investments. And from the overall infrastructure with some of the large deals we’re working on, I think it will have an impact on all product lines. I just can’t quantify based upon the timing, how much that would be. We just know that as a business, we see the opportunity the business wants to get the business and grow the top line revenue and so there will be some flux in that.
Phil Bernard: Okay, great. And is that happening as a result of conversations with these potential clients that they're staying, you guys are great, the service is great, but we’re missing these needs or you trying to anticipate future needs in the market?
Janine Seebeck: So, I'd just tell you that a lot of it is conversation, we talk about at the Analyst Day that we’ve got those 10 to 12 large change that we’re talking with. I think as we've talked to move kind of into that phase in the market and something that we haven’t really been before, there is just general needs in that market that we may not have in product today. And so with herein consistency to help us expand, as Larry just talking about to be able to capitalize in those markets, and so it’s not customization on a per customer base, it is just more market driven to be able to go after those types of markets in the large chain base.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back to Ms. Janine Seebeck for any closing remarks.
Janine Seebeck: Thanks Kelcie [ph]. That concludes this afternoon’s conference call. Thank you again to everyone for joining us this afternoon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.";[-0.06474811823288162, 0.05307496455793714];0.05307496455793714;-0.06474811823288162;0

Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Jonathan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us to review our fiscal 2017 third quarter results ending December 31, 2016. Joining me on the call today are Tony Pritchett, our Interim CFO; and Larry Steinberg, our CTO. I am happy to be with Agilysys and with all of you here today. We are in a good stage now in the history of Agilysys. A tremendous amount of investment, hard and smart work during the past few years have created significant competitive advantages for us, which we can now leverage to improve financial performance and enable significant value creation in the near and long-term. I am grateful to our Board of Directors, management and other teams in Agilysys for this opportunity to use the experience gained during my past successful stints at similar situations in enterprise software companies and to leverage the previous investments already made here to lead Agilysys to greatness. I have been here for about 1.5 months now and while I am still in the process of learning and getting my arms around all the details, the opportunities for disciplined revenue and profitability growth are quite clear to me. I don’t expect the turnaround to happen overnight, but I am confident that it will happen in the near-term. There will be a transition period both for myself and our team members as we look at approaching and handling many parts of our business differently. During the recently concluded December quarter, revenues increased 7% to $33.4 million, with recurring revenues posting a quarterly record of $16.2 million or 49% of total net revenue. Subscription-based SaaS revenues, which is one of the significant parts of our recurring revenue base, increased by 48% year-over-year. Gross margin during the quarter was 48.6%, reflecting the impact of amortization of software development costs for rGuest platform and product suite. This led to a net loss during the quarter of $1.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.7 million and $0.07 per diluted share during the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $3 million compared to $0.6 million during the same period last year. We continued to make good progress in growing our subscription-based SaaS revenue. The total contract value of subscription-based SaaS bookings for rGuest and other previously well-established products have nearly doubled during the first 9 months of fiscal 2017. With respect to our installed base, we ended the third quarter with more than 38,000 point-of-sale endpoints, up 15% from the same period last year. Nearly 248,000 hotel rooms are now being managed by our lodging solutions, up 6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and representing 5% of approximately 5 million hotel rooms across the United States. During the December quarter, we secured 29 contracts with new customers. The total contract value for subscription-based SaaS bookings for new customers increased 16% compared to new deals in the third quarter of last year and represented nearly 59% of new customers for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Tony for additional commentary regarding our financial results, let me take a couple of more minutes to share with you some of my initial thoughts, observations and expectations based on my first 5 weeks here. Agilysys is in a great position to grow as an industry leader in hospitality solutions and deliver significant added shareholder value. I had the opportunity to meet and speak to our customers during our recent user conference, Inspire, and many of them are keen on increasing their business levels with us if we could show some improvements in our product and solutions delivery velocity. The revenue growth opportunities are clearly there before us. It was also clear that many of the customers are open to replacing competitive products with Agilysys solutions. The combination of our strong and well-established product solutions, like LMS and InfoGenesis, along with our newer rGuest product suite, which will redefine the future of hospitality solutions and set the technology standard in many different ways. That combination gives us the ability to meet both the short-term and long-term needs of our customers and their guests. Some of our customers are also encouraging us to get our international expansion plans into high gear. As you know, international growth is a revenue stream we have badly scratched the surface of so far. We are fortunate to be serving markets which are healthy, growing and in need of improved solutions to keep up with the fast-paced technology changes that our guest expect and have become accustomed to. Our customers are in markets which are growing and becoming increasingly competitive, creating a growing need for hospitality solutions. In lodging, there are now over 53,000 properties in the U.S. alone. And the restaurant industry, which we can do a much better job of serving in the future, has over 1 million locations across the United States. I expect that we will significantly improve our internal productivity levels across the entire range of product development and delivery, customer services and support, sales and marketing and all other departments to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. We believe we are currently at the peak of our cost basis as a percentage of revenue in virtually every category of spend. Going forward, it is more a matter of managing productivity of output per unit of spend and getting more done in better cost effective ways. Going forward, I expect our revenue growth curve to be steeper than the cost growth curve. We will be equally effective with execution and innovation and will not sacrifice one for the other. Our customers expect both solid execution and great innovation from us. And I know from experience that there is no better way to create great shareholder value than exceeding our customer expectations in both execution and innovation. We will be committed to being the innovation leader in this industry and drive the rGuest product suite forward at an accelerated pace. Based on customer demand, we will also increase our product enhancement and delivery velocity on our well-established products as well. We are currently in the process of opening a wholly-owned captive development and technical support center in Chennai, Madras, India. We expect the center to be operational and adding significant strength to our current R&D, services and support teams by June, July this calendar year. I have had very successful previous experiences leading the establishment of and running of such development centers for Manhattan Associates and Bally Technologies is in my prior lives. We are confident that, apart from helping us with our immediate productivity, time to market and customer service objectives, the Chennai center will also greatly help us establish a significant market presence in Asia, where we have great opportunities for top line revenue growth. We are continuing to make good progress with new business opportunities with a couple of large global hotel operators. On the new business front, we recently announced that the Mark Hotel in New York City had selected InfoGenesis point-of-sale and InfoGenesis Flex to streamline food and beverage operations at their world renowned 150 room luxury property, further solidify our leadership position in the upscale hotel and resort market. Other notable new business wins include; Cypress Bayou Casino Hotel in Louisiana selecting a comprehensive suite, including InfoGenesis POS and Flex as well as rGuest Analyze and rGuest Pay, the Horseshoe Bay Resort in Horseshoe Bay, Texas, incorporating Visual One, traditional, Prairie Meadows Casino and Hotel in Iowa choosing Stratton Warren, SaaS, Rosewood Sand Hill in Menlo Park choosing InfoGenesis, SaaS, Spirit Lake Casino and Resort in North Dakota, incorporating Visual One SaaS and rGuest Pay, Wallowa Lake Lodge in Oregon choosing rGuest Stay and Pay, along with InfoGenesis SaaS and the Wequassett Resort and Golf Club choosing InfoGenesis SaaS and rGuest Pay. With that, let me turn the call over to Tony, who will review our financial results for the quarter. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thanks Ramesh and good afternoon everyone. Beginning with the review of our income statement, third quarter fiscal 2017 total revenue was $33.4 million, representing a 7% increase from total net revenues of $31.3 million in the comparable prior year period. Breaking down our revenue mix, product net revenues, which is comprised of both third-party remarketed products, including hardware and software and on-premise proprietary software license sales decreased 16% to $10 million and represented 30% of total revenue during the quarter compared to $11.9 million and 38% of total revenue during the prior year period. The decrease compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 is related to a reduction in third-party remarketed products. Q3 of last fiscal year includes a couple of outsized third-party product deliveries, which we were able to benefit from. On a sequential basis, product revenue was flat. Support, maintenance and subscription revenue or recurring revenues grew by 9% to $16.2 million and represented 49% of total revenues compared to 48% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by a 48% increase in our subscription based SaaS revenue, which itself accounted for 24% of support, maintenance and subscription revenue or approximately $3.9 million compared to $2.6 million or 18% of support, maintenance and subscription revenue in the fiscal 2016 third quarter. Going forward, we expect support, maintenance and subscription revenue will showed similar growth trends and that we will end fiscal 2017, with a 4% to 6% year-over-year growth rate. The ongoing growth in our subscription revenues is creating a larger base of recurring revenue that we will be able to recognize in coming quarters. Professional Services revenue grew 61% to $7.2 million compared to $4.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, reflecting a greater utilization of our services resources and increased capacity in support of new installations, along with $1.1 million services revenue related to revenue previously deferred for services provided in the past, where contractual commitments precluded revenue recognition until this quarter. Year-to-date, overall revenue has increased by 10%, with product revenue almost flat, support, maintenance and subscription revenue up 6% and professional services revenue up 48%. As it relates to the rGuest products, these revenues comprised 6% of total fiscal 2017 third quarter revenue. We did today revise our full year revenue guidance as we now expect fiscal 2017 revenue will be in a range of $128 million to $131 million, modestly below the previously anticipated range of $132 million to $136 million. This decline in the company’s revenue outlook is attributable to a reduction in realized and anticipated upfront product sales in the last half of the year, while support, maintenance and subscription services revenue, including SaaS revenue as well as professional services revenue, remained strong. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold increased approximately 16% to $17.2 million. This increase contributed to a 2% decline in total gross profit from $16.5 million to $16.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. And gross profit margin fell by 410 basis points to 48.6%. This decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily driven by the impact of an incremental $2.1 million of developed technology amortization costs as a result of certain rGuest products been placed in the service in the first half of 2017. We now expect gross margins will be just below the 50% range due to the lower full year revenue outlook related to the continued shift in revenue towards more subscription based sales from traditional software sales that is occurring faster than we anticipated. Operating expenses, inclusive of product development, selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses, was $15.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. This compared to $17.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and represented 46% of total net revenues versus 55% in the prior year period. Product development expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 2% year-over-year to $6.8 million and represented 20% of total revenue, slightly below the 22% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Sales and marketing increased $0.4 million or 8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The change is primarily the result of an increase of $0.2 million in employee wage related expenses as well as increased spend in advertising and promotion of $0.2 million related to new lead generation investments in content, search engine marketing and target prospect databases in order to accelerate the growth in lead acquisition and pipeline velocity in support of future revenue growth. This was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative of $1.8 million or 33% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2016. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we reported $1 million in forfeiture credits related to unvested share based compensation expense and a $0.2 million reversal of accrued incentive awards for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, whose departures from the company were announced during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. An additional reduction of $0.2 million was related to reduced incentive expense for other employees for the full year fiscal 2017 as compared to the full year fiscal 2016. This led to an operating loss of $1.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to an operating loss of $1.7 million in the prior year period. Net loss for the third quarter was $1.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately $2.4 million in the third quarter to $3 million versus $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016, was $52.7 million compared to $60.6 million at March 31, 2016. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $10.3 million of spending related to ongoing product development investments. Net cash provided by operations was $5.4 million compared to the prior year period of $8.3 million of net cash provided by operations. Adjusted for non-recurring items, net adjusted cash provided by operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $6.2 million compared to $8.9 million in the prior year period. In terms of NOLs, we have $190 million on our books, for which we can attribute a full valuation allowance and which will help us remain liable for just taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Looking ahead to the balance of fiscal 2017, we continue to expect full year revenue growth in the 6% to 9% range with continued growth around subscription based contracts, which results in both professional service revenue and remarketed product revenue upfront and software license revenue over the term of the contract. To wrap up, as we get ready to close fiscal 2017, we remain well positioned to take advantage of many revenue growth opportunities in front of us. With that, Jonathan, we can take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Bernard from Eilers, Krejcik Gaming, your question please.
Phil Bernard: Thanks for taking my call. Two quick questions, first one for Ramesh, next one for Tony, Ramesh, first congratulations on the new appointment. And I will just dive right in. We have been following the industry for a while and a few years back, you were instrumental in training around Bally’s systems business, I am curious as to whether you see any similarities between that position and your current situation in current role?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Hey, Phil, so nice to talk to you again. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Yes, there are a lot of parallels not only with Bally Systems but before that, about 7 years with Manhattan Associates when that company grew its revenue like 7x in 7 years or so. So there is a lot of parallels here. Both are in the B to limited B, right. B to – it’s not B2B like big companies, but – like Microsoft or Oracle, but B-to-limited B enterprise software. There is a lot of similarities among Manhattan, Bally systems and this. And when I look at the current situation where we are, both positives and negatives and how much improvement is possible both on the top line and in profitability, there are a lot of parallels. And I hope I have learnt my lessons well and I hope I carry a few lessons well with me that I can bring to bear in this situation.
Phil Bernard: Okay, great. Thanks. And then Tony, I know you mentioned revising revenue guidance down moderately, I am wondering what impact you think that will have on the EBITDA line, I know this is not guidance that you provided, but previous management team, at the beginning of fiscal ‘17, guided for 2x the previous year’s EBITDA, I am curious as to your thoughts?
Tony Pritchett: Yes. Hey Phil, thanks for the question. We are not – like you said, we are not providing specific EBITDA guidance for this year. What I can tell you is that will be a few million dollars up of our original estimates due mainly to two things. There is a couple of million dollars related to the reduction in revenue that you mentioned and that we guided to this in the press release. That’s mainly due to lower product sales. The other thing that will drive our EBITDA down a little bit is a couple of million dollars of extra expense that we didn’t originally plan. That’s necessarily in order to help expand the business and that’s related to the investment that we talked about on the last call.
Phil Bernard: Okay, great. That is it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Allen Klee from Sidoti, your question please.
Allen Klee: Yes. Hi. With the – if you can add a little help on how you are going to think about the extra spending that’s associated with winning new customers in terms of what it’s going towards and kind of where you stand with these larger customers and the opportunity there?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. You kind of broke up a little bit Allen, in between your question. You are talking about extra spending on what, please?
Allen Klee: For your products to tailor them for larger customer wins?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Okay, got it. Okay. So as far as the large scale hotel operators Allen, the larger deals that you are talking about, those opportunities continue to grow for us and InfoGenesis product line is our top focus area there. And implementations in the initial properties of the large scale operators are already underway and that will be an important component of our top line growth going forward. Now with respect to the extra spend and I will also kind of connect this with Phil’s question before about lessons that I have learnt before, a lot of what we are facing now is being more cost effective with what we do, focusing on our productivity levels, generating revenue from our previous well established products as well. So there are a number of areas that this company can improve a lot without any big extra spending. So when you think of our cost structure in all areas, like whether it is product development or any other area in the business, in every category of spend, I expect cost as a percentage of revenue to start going down. So you look at our overall cost, part of which is in cost of goods sold and part of which is in operating expenses, our overall cost as a percentage of revenue will start declining now. So from a revenue percentage standpoint, there is no more major extra spend that we need to do to bring home a lot of the new opportunities that we have. As revenues grow, I expect cost to grow, but at a much lower rate. So the cost growth will be at a much lower rate than the revenue growth rate. So relative to revenue level, there is no extra spending contemplated going forward, but as our top line continues to grow, we will make the prudent investments in the appropriate areas. But more and more at Agilysys, you will see the gap between revenue and cost increase. Does that make sense, Allen?
Allen Klee: Yes. Thank you so much. Then longer term, how do you think about the paths of the company moving to profitability and free cash flow positive?
Ramesh Srinivasan: We expect to get to free cash flow positive within the next – can’t guide. We can’t guide to an exact time period on that. But we are putting in place various changes and various initiatives to improve productivity and cost effectiveness. That will get us to a free cash flow positive stage in the not too distant future. I will live it at that.
Tony Pritchett: Yes. Allen, this is Tony. We don’t – look, Ramesh has only been here, call it, six weeks. We are in the early stages of our fiscal year ‘18 planning process. And at this point, we just don’t want to give guidance for next year or the future. But to Ramesh’s point, our goal is cash flow positive and we expect that costs as a percentage of revenue will continue down from this point. That’s a big focus for us.
Allen Klee: Thank you. And then can you update me on the number of quota carrying reps and any plans to grow that this year?
Tony Pritchett: Yes. We still got in – right around 30, a little over 30 quota carrying reps which hasn’t changed much in the last couple of quarters. And we don’t – there is no current term plan to change the structure of our sales force. We feel like we have got a pretty good base of quota carrying reps. But as we enter into the new fiscal year, anything is possible. So we are going to look at this as part of our planning process.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then just in terms of CapEx and capitalized software, is there any plans of changing spending on those?
Tony Pritchett: So when we talked about reducing spend as a percentage of revenue, CapEx is part of that conversation as well. So we are looking at total all cost of the business OpEx, cost of goods sold, CapEx. So that’s a big part of our business. We spend a lot of money on CapEx and we are going to be laser focused on that particular area and do what we can to make that fall in the same trend as the rest of our cost.
Ramesh Srinivasan: And Allen, please don’t interpret that as any reduced focus or any reduced “reducing the investment.” We are – we just want to be more cost effective with the investments we have made and the investments we will continue to make. And relative to revenue, we will continue to get to a better place as far as our overall spend is concerned. But all the focus areas that I have been mentioning before remain and we will just get better at doing more with the amount of money we spend.
Allen Klee: Okay. Thank you. Can you help me understand a little better what you have to do from where you were now to try to be successful in winning the bigger deals that have been noted better opportunities out there?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. So number one, we need to be a lot more cost effective with what we do in terms of being more productive, because in terms of all the investments, everything we need to do to grow our kind of business, we have made all the right decisions so far. So they are all there. It is a matter of doing more with what we expect. We also need to increase our product delivery velocity, right. We need to – we have significant investments in R&D obviously and we just need to deliver products at a quicker pace. Now in terms of lessons learned from my previous lives, like what Phil was asking me about, there is more – there are more revenue levels to be made from our currently established products as well. So our top line revenue growth can come from our currently established products and from our new rGuest product line. And I think we have room for improvement in customer centricity, remaining accessible to customers, taking both their short-term and long-term needs more seriously. So in terms of customer centricity, product delivery velocity, increasing the cost effectiveness of what we do, those are all the areas in which we can get much better as an organization, which will result in much better profitability.
Larry Steinberg: And this is Larry Steinberg. Just to add couple of things there from the specifics, when we talked about moving to these large-scale states and where you are managing thousands of outlets from a single site versus hundreds, there is the number of configuration management items that need to happen so that you can actually manage an enterprise from a single location. That’s one of the core things that we are working on as well as necessary international expansion. Those are the two big areas from, I would say, future bucket perspective.
Allen Klee: Okay, thank you. And then for your lowering of your revenue guidance, can you provide some color on – you said that upfront product sales are going to be lighter than originally thought in the back half, but can you provide any color behind what’s behind that?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Sure. So part of that, the slight reduction, right, it’s about 3% or so delta that we are talking about here. Part of that decreased product sale has to do with the fact that certain hardware pieces that we used to sell before as we move more and more to subscription-based SaaS revenue, so that hardware sales will reduce. And I think part of it also had a little bit to do with the leadership change uncertainty. And there were some customers who we caught delayed their buying decisions just to see how smoothly the leadership transformation happened and that went very well in the user conference. So that confidence should come back. And also the fact we are switching to SaaS-based subscription revenue also had a little bit to do with that.
Tony Pritchett: Yes. And Allen, the majority of the component of product revenues that’s going to come in lighter than we expected is hardware. There is also a component that is proprietary software. And as we switch to SaaS and that switch is happening faster than we planned for this year, we are seeing less proprietary software and more SaaS bookings.
Allen Klee: Okay, great. That’s it from me. Thank you so much.
Tony Pritchett: Thanks, Allen.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I would like to hand the program back to Ramesh Srinivasan for any further remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Jonathan. Thank you all for your continued interest in Agilysys. Please let’s assure that we will continue to work hard and smart to improve our sales in all the various business areas. We are well positioned to drive home the various advantages we have worked diligently to build. Also, a special thanks to our talented and dedicated Agilysys teams, to all our customers, partners and shareholders. Thank you all for your support. And we look forward to reporting on the next stage of our progress soon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[0.00101012416840085, 0.04691896573368348];0.04691896573368348;0.00101012416840085;0

Later we'll conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to hand the floor over to Norberto Aja, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Norberto Aja: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining the Agilysys fiscal 2017 fourth quarter conference call. We will get to management presentation and comments momentarily, as well as your questions and answers, but first I will review the Safe Harbor language. Today’s conference contains forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statement can be identified by words such as anticipate, intent, planned, goal, believe, estimate, expect, future, likely, may, should, will, and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include among others, statements we make regarding guidance relating to revenue and adjusted earnings from operations, expected operating results, such as revenue growth and profitability, market demand, cost efficiencies and strategy for growth, product development, customer service, market position and financial results. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurance of future performance instead they are based only on our current belief, expectations and assumptions, regarding the future of our business. Future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions.

When required a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and present in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release as well as the company’s website. With that, I now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramesh Srinivasan, President and CEO of Agilysys. Please go ahead, sir.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Norberto and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me on the call today is our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Tony Pritchett. Before I get started, a quick note of apology. Please pardon my hoarse voice and possible intermittent coughing, I caught a flu bug a few days ago while travelling, I am currently working my way through it. Let me begin with a quick overview of the fourth quarter and full year results, before providing an update on our various strategic initiatives and opportunities for growth. Compared to the previous comparable period, total net revenue for fiscal fourth quarter decreased 4.1% to $30.6 million. While full year net revenue increased by 6.1% to $127.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA in the fiscal fourth quarter was a loss of $0.2 million compared to a gain of $1 million during the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year FY ‘17, increased slightly compared to FY ‘16. The GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter and for the full year were $5.3 million and $11.7 million respectively, compared to $1.5 million and $3.8 million for the comparable prior year periods. Tony will provide a more extensive view of our financial results, including the income statement and balance sheet and more details on our future outlook. Going forward, we will be providing and periodically updating guidance based on two broad measures. One, a range of annual revenue; and two, our non-GAAP adjusted earnings from operations metric, which will be a comprehensive measure of all aspects of our operating business, including all cost pertaining to operations, regardless of what portions of them on capitalized for accounting or other reasons. We are also tracking our business internally based on this measure, as we manage and monitor our progress towards overall positive free cash flow and profitability. This measure is a close approximation of free cash flow without the cyclicality of working capital fluctuations based on timing of billings among other things. Based on this measure, our adjusted earnings from operations was a loss of $16.7 million for FY '16 and improved to a loss of $11.6 million in FY '17. We expect to reach positive territory by this measure during the fourth quarter of this current year FY '18 and hope to start the next fiscal year FY '19 on a positive adjusted earnings from operations run rate. Moving along to the other salient and strategic aspects of the business, while we did not expect a turnaround to happen overnight, I'm pleased with the progress we've made on various strategic and tactical initiatives during the five months I've been here. These initiatives continue to progress aimed at generating improvements in various aspects across our enterprise including the following four areas. One, achieving added leverage from our significant competitive advantages and resources. We continue to be in a good position to increase our investments in crucial growth areas, without any significant impact on overall spend in percentage of revenue terms. For instance, during FY '18, we expect the number of our R&D resources to increase by about 40% without any significant ramp up in overall R&D spend as a percentage of revenue. Two, improving our overall financial performance including revenue growth and becoming profitable as soon as practical. We expect to exit this upcoming fiscal year, FY '18 with positive adjusted earnings from operations run rate and expect to generate cash starting in our next fiscal year FY '19. We have identified multiple areas of the business, which can be run a lot more efficiently than before, thereby providing us the cost room to invest further in crucial areas that will drive revenue growth. We are focused on setting ourselves up for significantly higher revenue and profitability growth beginning FY '19. Three, improving our product and solutions delivery velocity. Apart from spending a great deal of time with our talented teams in our various offices, I have spent most of the five months I've been with Agilysys, visiting customers. Most of our customers want to do more business with us. If we can give them the products and the solutions they require at a faster pace. I feel very lucky to be leading such a wonderful revenue growth opportunity business with such talented people. Four, expanding our ability to address the potential we have in new geographical markets like Asia and Europe. We've hired two capable leaders Andrew Cox and James Slatter to lead our businesses in APAC and EMEA respectively. The expansion in R&D capacity will also help as we focus on getting our products ready for a greater number of international markets. In addition, we expect our India development centers to greatly help with expanding our business and support reach in Asia. Speaking of India development center, we are pleased to report that we made good progress with this crucial initiator. We've leased a 17,000 square foot facility that can accommodate around 160 people in a world class technology campus in Chennai. Other business occupants of this campus include Amazon, Cisco, AstraZeneca, Citi, Fidelity and GE. We expect to move into this office by end of June, with about 25 of the 80 personnel the -- who have accepted our offers to join us. We expect to be at peak capacity in this office by fiscal year-end. In addition we've also hired one of my former colleagues as Head of Business Transformation based in our Atlanta office. He is currently focusing his energies on driving various efficiencies and cost savings initiatives at Agilysys. He is focused on a set of special projects, which will help us become a lean high performance execution and innovation engine. Our productivity levels continue to increase in all areas of our business. We can still do a whole lot better. One of our critical areas of heightened emphasis is customer service. In the enterprise software business area that we are in great customer service will be at the heart of just about everything we do. We are in the process of transforming Agilysys into a company that is world class in customer service. We are now listening to our customers a lot better, a lot more frequently, spending a lot more time explaining our future product roadmaps, ensuring our customers have a say in such roadmaps and ensuring that they drive and get the benefit of all our future innovation. We've done well in terms of market share in the gamming vertical. We can and will duplicate that success in multiple other verticals like hotels, resorts and cruises and foodservices management if we continue to increase our passionate focus on customer service. As we look ahead we can see multiple areas of opportunities. One, serving larger clients in the hotel chains and foodservice management space. Two years ago, Agilysys was not even talking to any of the top 10 global hotel brands, while currently we are engaged actively with several of them. We have just signed an agreement with Hilton naming Agilysys as a Hilton approved hospitality solutions vendor and we hope to streamline guest transaction processing, reduced cost and improve operations at Hilton properties around the world. We have the opportunity now to better serve customers like Hilton and Compass, as we continue to improve our product and innovation delivery velocity and customer service levels. Two, cross selling to our current customer base. Currently about half of our customers use only one of our products. As our product delivery and innovation velocity increases we can grow by selling our point of sale and property management system centric solutions to our already well established customer base in verticals like gaining. Three, rollout our leading edge SaaS cloud-based rGuest Stay property management system product faster to the market. We are in the process of hiring additional R&D resources to speed up the development of various new functional features in rGuest Stay. This product is already live in multiple hotels with a proven sound technology platform. Our PMS solutions support around 250,000 rooms, which remains a small fraction of the overall market size. Our largest competitor for instance supports around 5 million rooms. Speeding up the development of a full set of features in rGuest Stay remains core to our future revenue growth. Four, international expansion, EMEA and APAC remain mostly green spaces for us now. We are working on multiple initiatives to speed up our growth in these regions. Some of the major hotel chains we are in the process of expanding business with are also keen on helping us expand to other international regions like Latin America. All things considered, we are lucky to be operating in growing markets with an increased need for better technology solutions that can help them serve their guest better and increase guest loyalty levels. As the U.S. and other hotel industries continue to compete against the reach of online travel companies, they will have an increased need for health from technology providers like us with products like rGuest Stay, rGuest Seat and other solutions, which can work well. As both on premise and that SaaS solutions based in the cloud and which can help them understand and manage their guests better. The industries and markets we serve are hungry for a world class technology provider and we absolutely intent to be the one. They remain dedicated to our goal of being great at both day-to-day execution and innovation for the future. Both aspects are critical to the success of our business. We are blessed with strong and well established product solutions like InfoGensis, LMS, VisualOne, Eatec, Stratton Warren and DataMagine. We also continue to make great progress with our newer rGuest solutions like Pay, Stay, Buy and Seat. The number of installs on these newer rGuest products continue to grow with each passing month. We support SaaS cloud based solutions for our customers across virtually our entire product set. We are uniquely positioned in the marketplace as a technology provider who can provide solutions both on premise and SaaS cloud based. With respect to our install base, we are now approaching 40,000 point of sale endpoints and 250,000 rooms. While this represents 12% and 4% growth respectively from the end of FY '16, we feel we have barely done justice to the market opportunity in front of us and to our potential. As we look forward, we remain intent on accelerating our path to profitability and to deliver better results for our shareholders. We remain committed to investing in the right areas of our business and becoming a lot more nimble and efficient as operators are lot more disciplined with our capital allocation strategies with a greatly enhanced fashion for a world class customer service. Our commitment to these principles will be the basis for our improved financial performance in the future. We expect FY '18 to be a year where we demonstrate improved results, while also setting ourselves up for a solid period of growth and profitability during FY '19 and beyond. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony Pritchett for more color on our financial results and future outlook, Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was $30.6 million, a 4.1% decrease from total net revenue of $31.9 million in the comparable prior year period. Revenue for the full year grew 6.1% over fiscal 2016 to $127.7 million. Our top-line performance benefitted from a significant improvement in recurring revenue including our subscription based SaaS recurring revenue. The SaaS recurring revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than our overall recurring revenue growth rate. Our installed point of sale endpoints rose 12% year-over-year and the number of rooms managed by our lodging solutions increased 4% year-over-year. This positive traction was offset by a challenging transition period in the middle quarters of fiscal 2017 as well as a decline in lower margin iSeries hardware sales over the second half of fiscal year 2017. Looking at revenue in greater detail, products revenues fell 24.9% to $8.9 million or 26.4% of total revenue during the quarter. Due to the difficult comps on the back of several large hardware refresh projects that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and did not repeat in the current period. On a full year basis, product revenue decreased 7.5% to $38.3 million versus $41.4 million in fiscal 2016, largely due to the drop that took place in the fourth quarter. Total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 6% of total fiscal 2017 revenue. Support, maintenance and subscription revenue or recurring revenue increased 3.7% to $16.3 million or 53% of total net revenues compared to $15.6 million or 49% of total net revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. And by 5.3% to $63.3 million or 50% of total net revenues on a full year basis. Driving that growth was a 49% increase in SaaS recurring revenues for the fourth quarter and a 44% increase on a full year basis, representing 25% and 24% of total recurring revenues respectively. Professional services revenue grew 14.3% to $6.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and by 38.3% on a full year basis, reflecting the positive impact of our increased booking volumes and enhanced throughput from our customer facing implementation and installation teams. Moving down the income statements, costs of goods sold increased 5.7% or $0.8 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year period. The 22.3% increase we had in costs of goods sold on a full year basis was largely due to the amortization of software development cost for first generation versions of the company’s rGuest solutions, along with the increased volume of professional services projects. Total gross profit declined 12.1% or $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and decreased 6.3% on a full year basis. This led to a gross margin of 50.6% in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter compared to 55.2% in the prior year period. The decreased gross margin is primarily the result of the previously disclosed impact of the amortization of software development cost mentioned above, which achieved general availability in the first half of fiscal 2017. Our current quarterly impact of this amortization is around $2 million more than comparable quarters in fiscal 2016. For the full year 2017 gross margin was 50% compared to 56.6% in fiscal 2016. Looking at operating expenses, which includes product development, selling and marketing and general administrative and depreciation expense the fourth quarter saw a 9.6% increase to $20.3 million compared to the prior year period. And as a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses represented 66.3% versus 58% in the prior year period and 56.5% for the full year fiscal 2017 compared to 58.5% for fiscal 2016. As expected, product development expense increased compared to fiscal 2016, increasing by 26% to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and by 8.8% to $29 million on a full year basis. And as a percentage of total revenue, product development expense represented 27.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 versus 20.9% in the same period last year and 22.8% for the full fiscal year 2017. Sales and marketing costs decreased 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, however increased by 5.5% on a full year basis, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and promotion as we expand our visibility in the market. General and administrative expense increased 4.4% on a quarterly basis, but decreased 8.9% on a full year basis, primarily due to reduced incentive expense and stock compensation associated with the departure of our former CEO and CFO. Depreciation of fixed asset and amortization of intangibles are both slightly elevated over prior year levels, reflecting investments internally used assets. Additionally we had around $1.6 million in restructuring, severance and other charges for the full year as a result of CEO separation benefits and related CEO transition costs, and early contract termination and other costs related to the transition from offering a proprietary workforce management solution to reselling our partner solution. As a result, we reported an operating loss of $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to an operating loss of $2 million in the prior year period. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $5.3 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.5 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Net loss for fiscal 2017 was $11.7 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $3.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share in fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of approximately $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 versus a gain of $1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. And on a full year basis, fiscal 2017 adjusted EBITDA was an increase of approximately $0.2 million to $4.5 million versus $4.3 million in fiscal 2016. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2017 was $49.3 million compared to $60.6 million at March 31, 2016. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $16 million in spend for our ongoing product development investments and investments in our internal assets, as well as impart offset by a cash inflow of around $2.2 million related to settlement of a life insurance policy and $3.4 million in cash provided by operating activities. And in terms of our NOLs, we continue to have approximately $187 million on our books for which we can attribute a full valuation allowance and will help us remain liable for only taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Looking ahead, we forecast fiscal 2018 full year revenue will be between $136 million and $140 million, reflecting an estimated 7% to 10% growth over fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings from operations is a non-GAAP metric that we have begun to report starting this quarter. We feel this metric provides a good indication of how we are tracking towards becoming a profitable company. It normalizes our non-cash and non-recurring charges, but includes expenditures on capital assets and therefore approximates our expected cash generation or cash burn for a given period for ongoing needs of the business. Adjusted earnings from operations was a loss of $11.6 million in fiscal 2017 and a loss of $16.7 million in fiscal 2016. This $5 million improvement is the result of planned adjusted EBITDA and reduced overall cash spend on capitalization of internally assets and software in 2017 as compared to 2016. We expect to be able to generate positive adjusted earnings from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and we then expect that adjusted earnings from operations will grow from there. It is important to note, that our forecast reflects an expectation for a significant improvement in the second half of the year following negative adjusted earnings from operations in the first half of the year. As it relates to margins, it is important to remember that we been reflecting the development cost of solutions such as rGuest Pay and rGuest Buy as software development cost in the balance sheet. However as these solutions reach general availability we will be amortizing new development costs in a linear fashion on to our income statement. As such with the general availability of rGuest Stay announced earlier in the quarter we expect gross margins in the low 50% range due to this non-cash developed technology expenses coming off the balance sheet. In summary, we enter fiscal 2018 with a healthy balance sheet including nearly $50 million in cash, improving fiscal discipline and many opportunities to expand the business all of which better position Agilysys to deliver profitable growth. With that let's turn the call over to Karen for questions. Karen?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee with Sidoti.
Allen Klee: Good afternoon. Can you talk a little more on product revenue of -- the decline there of what was behind that? And then what are the factors in the next fiscal year that are going to get that to accelerate to get you to your 7% to 10% guidance? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes hi Allen, good afternoon. With respect to product revenue, I would say that was also affected by the transition period that we went through at the end of FY '17. So we did see reduced product revenue for a couple of quarters. But we are beginning to see reasonably healthy trends as far as this quarter is concerned our June quarter. And also last year the comparative year compared to comparative year we had lower than usual hardware deals. The large hardware refresh deals that happened in the previous year did not happen in the last two quarters. But now when you look ahead as far as the June quarter is concerned, I would say it seems fairly likely that both with respect to product revenue and overall revenue you will see both sequential growth and year-over-year growth.
Allen Klee: Okay. And in terms of the India center, can you just remind me in terms of where that stands in terms of when you are expecting to get fully ramped up that and the productivity from it?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, so as far as the India center is concerned, we incorporated it a few months ago and started hiring and also leased out a 17,000 square foot facility that can accommodate about 160 people. We have made about 80 offers so far and about little more than 10 people have already joined us, they are working out of a temporary facility now as we build out our own facility. So we should moving to our building before the end of June about three, four weeks from now. And when we move in there we will move in with about 25 people. And thereafter month-after-month that number should increase dramatically and we expect to fill up that center of 160 people by end of the fiscal year. And in terms of productivity, we expect them to start making an impact in our product delivery velocity in about a couple of months from now.
Allen Klee: Okay. Can you give us any color on your sales force in terms of kind of if you had thoughts of where the number of people are now maybe where they were and if there are any plans are on changing that?
Ramesh Srinivasan: No major plans on that Allen, I think our sales force is doing well and is generating a number of good opportunities for us. So I don’t foresee any major changes in our sales force, other than the fact that we are looking at efficiencies and we are looking at effectiveness of our entire employee base not just with respect to sales force. So no major changes expected in the sales force other than expansion in Asia and EMEA. We expect to get a lot stronger in terms of business development and sales in our international regions. But other than that, I think our sales force is well established here. And as our product delivery velocity and our customer service improves, I think the current sales force is good to carry us further into higher revenue brackets.
Allen Klee: Okay, thank you. And then how should we think about CapEx and capitalized software levels for the coming year compared to where they have been?
Tony Pritchett: Hey Allen, this is Tony. For the coming year, we should see the level of capitalization about equivalent to what it was in fiscal 2017 on dollar terms. So…
Allen Klee: By capitalization you mean CapEx plus capitalized software.
Tony Pritchett: That’s correct, yes. So no major changes in dollar terms which -- that leads us to lower cost as a percentage of revenue for that area. So we are continuing to invest in the software products and opening the India development center adding over 100 employees there this year, those employees are going to be contributing to the software platforms that we have. And so some of the costs will be capitalized, but again not an increase in cost there just basically remaining flat.
Allen Klee: Okay. And if I was to look at your business by the major verticals of casinos and hotel related resorts, food service, how should I think about or how do you guys think about the growth rate potentials of the different areas?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, so in terms of future growth, when you think of Agilysys, as a much bigger company than we are today, a little more than half of the growth about 50% to 60% of the growth I think will come from the hotels, resorts and cruise that the HRC part of our business. And I think the remaining half or little bit less than half, 40% to 50% would come from growth in international regions like APAC, EMEA and little bit in Latin America as well and from our not traditionally strong verticals like gaming. And part of that growth that 40% to 50% growth will also come from selling more to our current customer base who are already there. So the short answer to your question would be more than half about 50% to 60% would come from hotel, resorts and the cruise segment of our market and a little less than half 40% to 50% will come from international regions, gaming our current customers and a couple of other smaller verticals.
Allen Klee: Thank you. And can you just give a comment on the competitive environment now of how it compares to some period in the past or if you’ve noticed any changes?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Haven't noticed any major changes, Allen. I don’t want to comment too much on our competitors, we always have the greatest respect for our competitors and I know that we have to get better. But I’ll tell you this much that it does feel like based on my conversations with current customers and prospective customers. It does really feel like we control our fate. If we get better, if we improve our product delivery velocity, if we improve our customer service standards and become more efficient as a company, I think there is a lot of business to be had. Looks like customers are eager to do more business with us. So it is just a matter of continuing to get better and I don’t think the competitive space is -- while we have a lot of respect for our competitors, I think there is enough room for us to grow.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then maybe last for you on, for your newer rGuest products if I look at Buy and Stay, I guess with Buy how the kiosk are doing and with Stay just you’ve touched on it, if anything else related to kind of the roadmap to kind or get the larger hotel chains. And maybe what you said about [Hi] would that means as a potential opportunity? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: You mean Hilton, Allen?
Allen Klee: Hilton, I apologies, Hilton yes.
Ramesh Srinivasan: No problem Allen. So with respect to Buy, I would say that the early part of this calendar year for the first two three months of this calendar year, we had a couple of challenging installs. We were going through a couple of pilot implements of Buy and we have passed all those technical challenges now and we are really beginning to see Buy picking momentum we add more functional features to it. Now as far as Stay is concerned, the technology platform is very stable, it’s doing well and there is one particular customer who is actually taking more and more properties live with very little help from us. So the technology platform is doing very well there. And there the challenges for us to add a lot more functional features as quickly as we can. So that it becomes a real competitive solution in the marketplace. So, I think Buy will gain momentum quick then Stay, but we are in the process of increasing the number of functional features on Stay. And your question on Hilton, yes we've signed our master services agreement with them and we are now one of their register providers. And big customers like Hilton and there are a couple of other such hotel deals we’re are working on as well should provide us -- should be a major part of our immediate one to two year growth.
Allen Klee: That's great. Thank you so much.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Allen.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Phil Bernard with Eilers, Krejcik Gaming LLC.
Phil Bernard: Hi guys, thanks for taking my call. Couple of quick questions, I know you guys have given some great color so far. First one, I believe at the beginning of this fiscal year you began the implementation of a large rGuest Stay rollout with the Drury hospitality group? Wondering if you could give an update on that, maybe what type of progress you guys are making and how that implementation is going and how the customers receiving the product?
Tony Pritchett: Yes, hey, Phil, this is Tony. That was the customers that Ramesh just mentioned. So that rollout is actually going very well and the way that that particular implementation worked is on the frontend we had some pretty heavy involvement with them to try to teach them how to do installations on their own. And then after they did a handful of hotels with us then they took over and they started doing it themselves. So that rollout is actually going really well there receiving the product very well and they're able to implement it themselves with a very little help from us, which is a true benefit of the product. And that's why we think that the technology platform is sound and is stable and is proving itself with that customer, with Drury.
Phil Bernard: Okay, great. And maybe an estimate on when you think those units will be fully deployed?
Tony Pritchett: The full rollout for Drury probably takes another year. So, it's a pretty long rollout cycle for them.
Phil Bernard: Okay. So, another potential or not potential another sequential growth driver in that SaaS line through fiscal year '18?
Tony Pritchett: Yes.
Phil Bernard: And you guys gave us some figures on POS terminals installed PMS rooms. Do you have any updated figures for how many rGuest Pay installs you guys have through this quarter?
Tony Pritchett: rGuest Pay, we don’t -- I don’t have that number right in front of me Phil. We can get that information but…
Phil Bernard: Got it, no worries, and I’ll keep it short. That's it for me. Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks, Phil.
Operator: Thank you. And that conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back our management for any further comments.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Karen. And thank you all for your interest in Agilysys. We have great opportunities in front of us and we are committed to taking them with both hands. On behalf of our Board, our management team, I'm very thankful to our talented and dedicated team, to our valued customers who continue to trust us with their mission critical applications and to our investors, without whom we would not be here. We appreciate all your support. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
36;AGYS;2017-08-06;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Agilysys Fiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would like introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Norberto Aja, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Norberto Aja: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining the Agilysys fiscal 2018 first quarter conference call. We’ll get started in just a minute with management’s presentation and comments. But before doing so, let me review the Safe Harbor disclosure. Today’s conference contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipate, intend, plan, goal, believe, estimate, expect, future, likely, may, should, will, and other similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include among others, statements we make regarding guidance relating to revenue and adjusted earnings from operations, expected operating results, such as revenue growth and profitability, market demand, cost efficiencies and strategy for growth, product development, customer service, market position and financial results. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions, regarding the future of our business. Future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, our ability to achieve operational efficiencies and meet customer demand for products and solutions and the risk described in today’s news announcement in the company’s filling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statement made by us in today’s conference call is based solely on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement that maybe made from time-to-time whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Today’s call and webcast will also include non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G. When required, a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and present in accordance with GAAP can be found in today’s press release as well as in the company’s Web site. With that, I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramesh Srinivasan, President and CEO of Agilysys. Please go ahead, Ramesh.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Norberto, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2018 first quarter results and our promising path forward. Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. Let me begin with a quick overview of the first quarter results, before providing an update on our progress against our strategic initiatives and some comments regarding our forward-looking guidance. Compared to last fiscal year’s first quarter, total net revenue increased 9.4% to $33.9 million, an all-time quarterly record. Adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.6 million compared to 0.4 million last Q1, while the GAAP net loss was higher at 3 million, a loss of $0.13 per share compared to 2.3 million, a loss of $0.10 per share last Q1. Compared to last year’s – last fiscal year’s Q1, our non-GAAP adjusted earnings from operations remained close to the same level as last year at a negative $3.5 million versus a negative $3.2 million last year, in spite of a significant increase in our cost structure towards the end of last year to prepare ourselves internally for certain large customer deals that are now beginning to materialize, and capital expenditures to open our India development center. With improving efficiencies, we’ve now started dialing back on our overall spend. Our services gross margin at 20% was lower than last year’s due to the recent restructuring of the services team to redeploy certain internal resources into billable functions with direct customer responsibility, which results in their cost being included in the cost of goods sold definition. Previously, our services teams were organized by function and by product, making direct accountability for customer work difficult to pin down. Our services teams are now organized by customer segments by customers, with clearly defined responsibility and accountability for customer satisfaction levels. We’ve also recently created a technical services team entirely focused on immediate customer needs. We expect improvements in services margins going forward. As mentioned during our June earning’s call and press release, we expect to achieve a full year revenue growth of between 7% and 10%, meaning our FY '18 full year revenue level of 136 million to 140 million. We expect revenue during the second half of fiscal 2018 to be higher than the first half, as the strategic growth initiatives currently being put in place take complete shape. We also expect to generate positive adjusted earnings from operations during this fiscal year’s fourth quarter. That would make the FY '18 fourth quarter our first ever positive adjusted earnings from operations quarter. We expect to maintain positive adjusted earnings from operations thereafter. Please note that the non-GAAP adjusted earnings from operations measure is a close proxy of our free cash flow on an annual basis. Our free cash flow tends to be cyclical on a quarterly basis. Typically, lagging the adjusted earnings from operations measure during the first two quarters of most fiscal years and then getting ahead of it during the last two quarters. That has to do with the historical timing of our annual recurring revenue billing and collections and is not related to anything operational. On an annual basis, we expect the free cash flow and adjusted earnings from operations to closely mirror each other with the exception of any one-time cash payments. Tony will provide more color on our financial results later. We continue to make good progress on nine strategic operational initiatives as we move towards transforming Agilysys into a high-performance SaaS and on-premise base leader in the hospitality, technology and software solutions space. One, during the past few months, virtually every aspect of our business has become a lot more customer-centric than before. Every department at Agilysys now understands that we are in the business to help our hospitality customers serve their guests better, increase their guests experience and create and maintain guest loyalty. We are listening a lot more to our customers now regardless of which Agilysys product they currently use. That increased customer sensitivity culture shift can now be heard and felt in our offices and in various customer locations every day. I have personally been involved in many customer visits during the past six months. This industry is hungry for a world-class customer-centric technology vendor, and we are fast becoming The One. We have seeing positive and encouraging signs from our customers that they are noticing the change, and they are now discussing more business opportunities with us. We expect that positive business trend to keep getting better. Number two; following up on the customer sensitivity topic, we are seeing growth opportunities in each of the major market segments we are currently operating in. In Gaming, many of our customers are seeing increases in non-gaming revenues, which creates good opportunities for point-of-sale and property management software solutions. Across hotels and resorts, there is an increasing demand for software platforms and solutions that can operate in both SaaS cloud-based and on-premise installation architectures for solutions that can help increase overall guest experience, improve guest loyalty and operational efficiencies. As the hotel and resort industry continues to compete against online booking units and strive to create an identity of their own with their guests, there is a growing demand for the kind of technology solutions we offer. Cruise lines are currently enjoying a healthy business environment with passenger numbers expected to exceed 25 million in calendar 2017. Cruise operators are now having an increased need to improve operations, optimize inventory control, streamline their food and beverage management and maximize fleet efficiency. In the restaurants and food services verticals, there is increasing demand for comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions, including guest-facing terminals that elevate guest experiences and allow brand consistency and enhance customer loyalty for restaurant operators. Our installed base is now just over 41,000 point-of-sale endpoints and 251,000 property management system rooms. While this represents 13% and 5% growth, respectively, from the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we feel we have barely done justice to the market opportunity in front of us and to our potential. Number three; we have taken major strides towards increasing our products and solutions delivery velocity, a critical component of our overall operational strategy. Our customers want to do more business with us as we continue to provide them the required products and solutions at a more rapid pace. Between March 31, 2017, that is earlier this year, and September 30, 2017, that is coming up in a couple of months, we expect our development engineering capacity to have increased by more than 40%. We are also focused on increased R&D efficiency so that we can get more development done at lesser overall costs. We have greater control over our R&D processes now. We are also focused on increasing our engineering development capacity in non-R&D areas, like professional services and customer support. Our newly created technical services division has already created a number of significant revenue opportunities for us while also fulfilling a long-pending customer need. We expect to continue to increase our engineering development velocity capacity in R&D, services and support functions, while also simultaneously reducing the overall spend as a percentage of revenue. Number four; our captive wholly-owned development center based in Chennai, India, is now operational and contributing meaningfully to our product development efforts. We will decide on expanding the center after we get through this initial phase. Number five; we continue to develop and improve our world-class suite of software solutions. As just one example, we recently announced the latest version of our groundbreaking DataMagine Document Management System, which now includes innovative enhancements designed to increase speed, improve security and boost overall performance. We continue to invest in and enhance our well-established product solutions like InfoGenesis, LMS, Visual One, Eatec and Stratton Warren while also making good progress with our newer rGuest solutions, like Stay, Buy, Pay and Seat. rGuest Buy is fast becoming a significant growth driver for us and the number of properties live on rGuest Stay continues to grow. We recently crossed the 5,000 room threshold for Stay. We support SaaS cloud-based solutions for our customers across virtually our entire product set. We are uniquely positioned in the marketplace as a technology provider who can provide solutions both on-premise and SaaS cloud-based. Number six; we will continue investing in crucial revenue growth areas, including R&D, innovation, services, customer support, sales, marketing and international expansion. We will be sensible to such investments and make them within the overall context of discipline, profitable revenue growth. Driving revenue growth and increasing profitability levels are both crucial and equally important goals for us going forward. A portion of our increased R&D engineering capacity is currently focused on getting our products ready for international markets, especially Asia and Europe. We are also in the process of expanding our business with multiple major hotel chains. Number seven; we went live with Salesforce.com a couple of weeks ago. The Salesforce.com implementation has helped us get a single, centralized customer record for all sale, support, services and other customer activities. This enhanced availability of customer information has already improved collaboration among team members and gives us far better visibility into our sales opportunities and processes. During the recent past, we have thoroughly reviewed sales productivity and processes and have implemented significant changes in our sales and marketing approaches, including the composition and regional coverage patterns of our teams, compensation structure and go-to-market strategies. Number eight; we have made good strides in increasing internal efficiencies and teamwork. We are all together beginning to pull our company forward and towards customers. We have uncovered multiple areas where we can be a lot more efficient in our execution. Efficiency increases in multiple areas of the business are helping us find the cost room to invest sensibly to take advantage of the many revenue growth opportunities that are there in front of us. Number nine; last and definitely not the least, we are intent on building a workplace that attracts and retains the best and the brightest to help us improve our product and innovation delivery velocity and customer service. Investing in employee, technical and leadership training is a crucial priority for us. In summary, we remain confident in achieving the financial guidance provided when we reported the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter results, as we continue to make good progress towards transforming this business and becoming a more nimble and efficient operating business that is customer-centric and engineering product and innovation-driven, providing far greater value propositions for our customers and thereby, delivering much improved financial results. We are a couple more quarters away from turning positive on our adjusted earnings from operations measure for the first time and becoming increasingly profitable from there. We are in growing marketplaces with increasing demands for the solutions we offer. We essentially control our own fate, which is a great position to be in. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony Pritchett, our CFO, for more color on our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 revenue was $33.9 million, a 9.4% increase from total net revenue of $31 million in the comparable prior year period, marking a quarterly record. Our top line growth largely reflects an increase in recurring revenue of 11.5%. Going forward, we expect future recurring revenue growth to level off and fall back to the mid to high-single digit range over the balance of the year. Looking at revenue in greater detail, product revenues increased 8% to $10.3 million and represented 30.4% of total revenue during the quarter. Product revenue in the quarter fell within the typical range of 60% to 70% hardware and 30% to 40% software. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue or recurring revenue increased 11.5% to $16.7 million or 49.2% of total net revenues compared to $14.9 million or 48.3% of total net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In addition, recurring revenue growth was driven by a 58% increase in SaaS revenues for the first quarter. SaaS revenues comprised 28% of total recurring revenues compared to 20% of total recurring revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We are pleased that SaaS recurring revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than our overall recurring revenue. Professional services revenue grew 6.6% to $6.9 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting the positive impact of enhanced throughput from our customer-facing implementation and installation teams, driven by our professional services team realignment. Total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 5% of total fiscal 2018 Q1 revenue. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold increased 16.5% or $2.4 million in the first quarter versus the prior year period. This increase was largely due to the amortization of software development costs for first-generation versions of the company’s rGuest solutions along with increased costs in the professional services line associated with restructuring of professional services workforce to better address customer needs, leading to more customer-facing employees and adding a technical services team. This led to total gross profit of $16.7 million or a 3% increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for fiscal 2018 first quarter was 49.2% compared to 52.3% in the prior year period and in line with stated guidance for our annual gross margins to be in the low 50% range due to the previously disclosed impact of the amortization of software development costs for first-generation versions of rGuest, which achieved general availability in the first half of fiscal 2017. Looking at operating expenses, including product development, selling and marketing and general and administrative expense, the first quarter saw a 6.9% increase to $18.6 million compared to the prior year period; but as a percentage of net revenues, represented a decrease to 54.8% versus 56.1% in the prior year period. As expected, product development expense was down slightly to $6.6 million compared to $6.9 million in Q1 of fiscal 2017, but decreased as a percentage of revenue to 19.6% compared to 22.1% in Q1 of last year. And as a percentage of total revenue, product development expense decreased from 27.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales and marketing costs decreased 8.9% year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting strategic initiatives undertaken to better align compensation with common industry standards for a software technology-focused company. And as expected, general and administrative expense increased $1.9 million or 39.5% year-over-year. This increase includes about $600,000 in non-recurring expenses related to professional fees and contract labor, and we expect our Q2 general and administrative expense to be back down to a level similar to that of Q4 fiscal '17, with incremental improvements in Q3 and Q4. Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles are both slightly elevated over prior year levels, reflecting investments in internal-used assets. As a result, we reported an operating loss of $3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to an operating loss of $2.2 million in the prior year period. Net loss for the first quarter was $3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $2.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was a gain of approximately $1.6 million in the first quarter versus a gain of $0.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2017, was $43.4 million compared to $49.3 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $5.1 million in spend for our ongoing product development investments and investments in our internal assets, as well as a normal cash outflow from operations that we experienced in the first fiscal quarter due to the timing of when we bill and collect the annual maintenance. It is also important to note that our capital expenditures in the first quarter included approximately $1 million for the investment in opening the India development center. Without the investment in the India development center, our cash burn for the quarter would have been less than $5 million compared to $5.3 million of cash used in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and $9 million of cash used in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And in terms of our NOLs, we continue to have approximately $190 million on our books, for which we can attribute a full valuation allowance and will help us remain liable for only taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Adjusted earnings from operations was a loss of $3.5 million in the first quarter, relatively flat compared to a loss of $3.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As Ramesh mentioned, we remain on track for a significant improvement in the second half of the year and reiterate our forecast for fiscal 2018 full year revenue of between $136 million and $140 million and to generate positive adjusted earnings from operations in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year with adjusted earnings from operations growing from there. As a reminder, we will be providing and periodically updating guidance based on two broad measures; a range of annual revenue and a non-GAAP adjusted earnings from operations metric. We believe this metric provides a good indication of how we are tracking towards becoming a profitable company. It normalizes our non-cash and non-recurring charges, but includes expenditures on developed software and fixed assets, and therefore, approximates our expected cash generation or cash burn for a given period for ongoing needs in the business. We are also tracking our business internally based on this measure, as we manage and monitor our progress towards overall positive free cash flow and profitability. As it relates to margins, we continue to expect gross margins in the low-50% range as non-cash developed technology expenses come off the balance sheet and solutions such as rGuest Stay reach general availability and commence to amortize their development costs in a linear fashion onto our income statement. In closing, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet, including over $43 million in cash. We are improving our fiscal discipline and opportunities to expand the business, all of which better position Agilysys to deliver overall free cash flow generation and profitability. We are making progress towards top line and bottom line growth, which will unlock value for our shareholders. With that, let’s turn the call over to the operator for questions. Michelle?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And I’m showing no questions on the phone lines.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Okay. If there are no questions, thank you, Michelle. Thank you all for listening and participating in this call. On behalf of our Board of Directors, our management team and all our talented and dedicated team members, we sincerely thank you for your continued interest in Agilysys.

We look forward to providing you our next update three months from now. Thank you, and enjoy the summer and take some time off to visit our customers more often. Thank you.

Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. Let me begin with a quick overview of the second quarter results, before discussing progress made against our various strategic initiatives. Compared to last fiscal year's second quarter, total net revenue decreased 7.8% to $30.1 million, that is three zero, $30.1 million, leading to a GAAP net loss of $3.2 million or a loss of $0.14, that is one four, $0.14 per share, compared to a loss of $2.4 million or a loss of $0.11 per share in fiscal 2017 Q2. Notwithstanding the softness of the revenue results, largely due to lower third-party hardware sales, in our current form as a pure-play hospitality software solutions company for the past four or so years, we were able to achieve our best ever quarter in terms of adjusted earnings from operations. As discussed earlier, the adjusted earnings from operations measure is a close proxy for free cash flow on an annual basis. This measure also improved by 67% on a sequential basis from the first quarter of this fiscal year. Our continuing initiatives to lower cost as a percentage of revenue and realign our overall operational structure to significantly reduce spend in non-growth areas have resulted in significant improvement in adjusted earnings from operations, despite the lower revenue level for the quarter. We expect to end this fiscal year with a cash balance that is at or slightly above current level. And if things turn out as planned, our next fiscal year, fiscal 2019, should be significantly better than fiscal 2018 in many aspects, including from a cash flow perspective. In spite of the significant investments involved in building our India development center, our total capital expenditure, including capitalized software were flat as a percentage of revenue, compared to Q4 of fiscal 2017. Most of our operating line items were lower as a percentage of revenue, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 when we began to implement many of the cost management initiatives. This has been achieved through prudent management of expenses, as well as a realignment of our workforce to make our talent mix far more engineering and software development-oriented. As a result, we incurred some restructuring expenses in our current quarter income statement. We are pleased with the increasing levels of recurring revenue with both SaaS-based and maintenance revenue growing. We expect our recurring revenue base to continue to grow in the future. As reflected in the weaker-than expected top-line results for the second quarter, we acknowledge the reality that despite the progress being made across various strategic initiatives, it will take us a few more quarters to make a real difference in the marketplace. We are therefore updating our guidance for fiscal 2018 full year revenue to a new range of $130 million, one three zero million, to $134 million, compared to the prior guidance of between $136 million and $140 million. Despite this change, we remain on track with our other guidance to achieve positive adjusted earnings from operations during the fourth quarter and to improve on that going forward, particularly as our revenue growth starts to kick in. We continue to make marked progress in transforming Agilysys into a world-class, customer-centric and engineering-driven software organization. We will continue to invest in areas which will drive future growth including software development and international infrastructure. We will remain prudent in our decisions regarding which areas require more investments to help us move the ball forward and areas where we may need to tighten up to help us move towards profitability and positive cash flow as quickly as possible. During the first six months of this fiscal year, we have increased our engineering development capacity by about 50%, five zero, 50%. Our India development center already has over 130 employees onboard, and we have been able to complete about 800 development tasks at the site so far including pending product fixes and new enhancements in a little more than four months. Given the success of our India development center initiative, our Board recently approved doubling the facility to accommodate 330 employees. We expect to reach this capacity level during the first quarter of next fiscal year that is around the April to June 2018 timeframe. The key to our future growth and success will be how well we move forward with our product roadmaps with respect to our rGuest product line and our well-established products including our flagship POS product, InfoGenesis. That acceleration of product development is beginning to happen now. As those product improvements and enhancements reach our current and prospective customers, we expect to strengthen our competitive advantage. We expect product enhancements to be a crucial driver of future revenue growth along with a customer-centric services group and reenergized more motivated and better-positioned sales and marketing teams. Some of our current product roadmap focus areas include the requirements for the Asia and Europe markets, where our market shares are currently quite low and represent significant growth opportunities. The changes we made to our professional services teams a few months ago to align the teams directly by customers have been yielding good results so far. Many customers have noticed and appreciated the much improved attention they are getting from us and the increased levels of customer service. A quick update on our senior management executive team. As you know, Tony Pritchett is our CFO and Kyle Badger continues to lead our HR and legal teams. Larry Steinberg, our CTO is focused on speeding up the rGuest platform and product-line roadmap delivery, along with leading our internal systems, SaaS operations and cyber security initiatives. Cyber security remains one of our intense focus areas to ensure we protect ourselves and our customers as best as we possibly can. Tony, Kyle and Larry are Agilysys' veterans who have been with us for many years. Rob Jacks, who has had great success in the past as the CIO of multiple successful enterprises and was a long time customer of Agilysys prior to joining us a couple of years ago is leading our professional services and technical services teams. Sridhar Laveti, a 25 year enterprise software veteran, who was my colleague in a couple of previous successful professional endeavors, joined us earlier this calendar year and is heading the product development of all our well-established products including InfoGenesis, LMS and Visual One. In addition, Sridhar is also leading our customer support teams. Prakash Bhat. His last name is spelled B as in boy, H A T as in thumb, Prakash Bhat, also a former colleague for a number of years heads our India development center. And just recently, we engaged a leading executive search firm to help us find our next Head of Sales and Marketing. Reenergizing our sales and marketing teams to get our revenue growth initiatives going with positive passionate enthusiasm, high work ethic and world-class customer focus is a high priority focus area for us. With around 50%, that is half of our current customers using only one of our products, we can do much better with relatively simple objectives like better cross-selling. We have recently introduced new sales compensation incentive schemes targeted at such sales bookings and revenue growth possibilities. In summary, I am even more convinced than I was at the beginning of this calendar year, when I joined Agilysys, that this business holds tremendous shareholder value-creation opportunity. The hospitality software solutions market, our customer base is hungry for a world-class solutions provider who is great, both with product development velocity, moving software solutions forward, at the speed of the current technology progress we see all around us and can also simultaneously provide world-class customer service. We intend to be such a provider and partner to our clients. As the only technology solutions provider in this space focused on both POS and PMS in the $100 million to $300 million annual revenue sweet spot, small enough to be nimble and agile and yet large enough to be a stable partner, we fully intend to make great use of this opportunity to drive home the advantage and generate great value for our employees, customers and shareholders. As we continue to transform this business to where it needs to be, we do understand that there will be some bumps during the short-term. However, that will not deter us from reaching our medium and long-term goals. I am confident we have a stronger launching pad today than at any other time during the last four years since we became a pure-play hospitality technology software solutions provider. We are well on our way towards improving sales productivity, increasing internal efficiencies, attracting exceptional talent from all over the world, increasing product development velocity and investing in all possible revenue growth areas. In addition, it is good that we continue to enjoy a healthy balance sheet that includes nearly $40 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony Pritchett, our CFO, on our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Anthony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 – our second quarter fiscal 2018 revenue was $30.1 million, a 7.8% decrease from total net revenue of $32.7 million in the comparable prior year period. The decline in top-line largely reflects a decrease in product base revenue of 31.8% on the back of a significant decline in hardware equipment sales. Revenue from third-party products was down 42%, compared to Q2 of last year, while revenue from proprietary software products was down just 3%. Going forward, we see no reason to believe hardware sales won't get back to historical growth levels. Looking at revenue in greater detail, product revenue decreased by $3.4 million or 31.8% to $7.3 million and represented 24.3% of total revenue during the quarter. Product revenue in the quarter did not follow the typical range of 60% to 70% hardware and 30% to 40% software instead, software revenue this quarter was much closer to a 50% split with hardware within product revenue. Recurring revenue increased $1.2 million or 7.6%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, largely driven by new customers using our on-premise software products, as well as an increase in SaaS-based recurring revenue. The recurring revenue growth was driven by a 28.8% increase in SaaS revenues for the second quarter. SaaS revenues comprised 29.2% of total recurring revenues, compared to 24.4% of total recurring revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We are pleased that SaaS-based recurring revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than our overall recurring revenue. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue represented 56.8% of total net revenues, compared to 48.7% of total net revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Professional services revenue decreased $0.3 million, 0.3, or 5.6% to $5.7 million reflecting the impact of decreased volume related to customer installations and implementation projects tied to the sale of on-premise and subscription-based solutions. Total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 7% of total fiscal 2018 second quarter revenue. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold decreased 12.1% or $2 million in the second quarter versus the prior year period as a result of lower hardware revenue. Our total gross profit decreased $0.5 million or 3.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Taking a closer look, products gross profit decreased $0.7 million with gross profit margin increasing approximately 2% to 25.9%, primarily as a result of the increased proportion of proprietary software revenue to total product revenue compared to Q2 of fiscal 2017. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $1.2 million, leading to a total gross margin increase of 1.6% to 74% on the back of the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers. Professional services gross profit decreased by $1 million on the back of a slightly lower professional services revenue, while gross profit margin decreased 15.5% to 14.2% as the redeployment of internal resources that were previously not billable were converted into billable functions as a part of restructuring our professional services workforce into teams responsible for named customer accounts. This resulted in gross margin for the fiscal 2018 second quarter of 51%, favorably comparing to 48.6% in the prior year period and in line with stated guidance for our annual gross margins to be in the low 50% range due to the previously disclosed impact of the amortization of software development costs for first-generation versions of rGuest. Looking at operating expenses, the second quarter saw a 1.9% increase in operating expenses to $18.6 million, compared to the prior year period. However, operating expenses, excluding the charges for restructuring, severance and other charges and legal settlements, decreased by 2.2%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and decreased by 14% compared to Q4 of fiscal 2017 when we started executing on our strategic initiatives that Ramesh discussed earlier. Product development expenses decreased $0.1 million or 1.9% despite the 50% increase in our engineering development capacity. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.9 million or 17.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million or 8.2%. Restructuring, severance and other charges increased $0.8 million as part of our ongoing efforts to better allocate resources to our crucial revenue growth areas, while increasing internal efficiencies in other non-revenue-generating areas. As a result, we reported an operating loss of $3.2 million for the second quarter, which includes $1.2 million in depreciation and amortization and $1.1 million of share-based compensation. Net loss for the second quarter was $3.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was a gain of approximately $2.3 million for the second quarter, a $1 million improvement versus a gain of $1.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2017, was $38.5 million, compared to $49.3 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $5.5 million invested in the development of proprietary software and approximately $3.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment and internal-use software development. And in terms of our NOLs, we currently carry approximately $196 million in full valuation allowance on our books, which will help us remain liable for only taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our current NOLs expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2038. As it relates to our free cash flow, keep in mind that it tends to be cyclical on a quarterly basis lagging the adjusted earnings from operations measured during the first half of most fiscal years and then getting ahead of it during the last half. That has to do with the timing of our annual recurring revenue billing and collections. On an annual basis, we expect the free cash flow and adjusted earnings from operations to closely near each other with the exception of any one-time cash payments, like the restructuring payments we had in this fiscal quarter. Looking at adjusted earnings from operations, we experienced a loss of $1.2 million in the second quarter, favorable comparing to a loss of $3.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and reflecting the positive impact of our operational initiatives that are having on the cost structure of our company. As Ramesh mentioned, we updated our guidance for fiscal 2018 full year revenue to a new range of $130 million to $134 million, compared to prior forecast of between $136 million and $140 million. Notwithstanding the change in full year revenue guidance, we continue to expect to generate positive adjusted earnings from operations in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. And as it relates to margins, we also continue to expect gross margins to be in the low 50% range as non-cash developed technology expenses come off the balance sheet and solutions such rGuest Stay reach general availability and commence to amortize their development cost in a linear fashion onto our income statement. As mentioned on prior calls, we will continue to provide and periodically update guidance based on both the range of annual revenue and a non-GAAP adjusted earnings from operations metric, as we believe these metrics provide a good indication of how we are tracking towards becoming a profitable company by normalizing our non-cash and non-recurring charges, while also including expenditures on developed software and fixed assets, therefore, better approximating our expected cash generation or cash burn for a given period for ongoing needs in the business. We are also tracking our business internally based on this measure as we manage and monitor our progress towards overall positive free cash flow and profitability. We do remain confident in our ability to generate positive adjusted earnings from operations in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. To echo Ramesh's opening comments, our results, including the significant year-over-year improvement in adjusted earnings from operations are already beginning to benefit from our initiatives to lower cost as a percentage of revenue and realign our overall cost structure. I will also reiterate the point that we are not withholding investment in areas of the business that generate productive software development improvements or generate sales, bookings and revenue. We are, however, looking at other areas of the business to manage cost and allow for investment where it is necessary, so we can generate profitable revenue growth. Our efforts to reduce overhead, streamline operations and further leverage our resources to ensure that we drive sales, EBITDA, earnings growth and shareholder value in a sustainable manner are beginning to take hold, and we feel good about the progress we've made towards our strategic plans. In closing, we are pleased by the steady progress we are making to restore our growth momentum and remain encouraged about the opportunities ahead of us to further leverage our existing customer base, engage with new customers and enter new markets. Agilysys is better positioned than it ever has been to become a growing and profitable company, and we remain confident that we are taking the necessary steps to position Agilysys for long-term sustainable growth. With that, let's turn the call over to the operator for questions. Danielle?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee from Sidoti. Your line is open.
Allen Klee: Hi, good afternoon. For product sales, can you go into a little about, maybe what happened in the quarter and what do you think you have to change? Or maybe what the challenge is in closing sales? Or just any color at all to how we should think about that going forward? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. Hi, Allen. Good to talk to you. With respect to the quarter, Allen, we had a much – more than expected number of deals pushing that got delayed that we thought would close in the quarter that got delayed out of the quarter. I would say that was the main reason. And the secondary reason overall, not just talking about the quarter is that, a lot of the improvements, product improvements, services improvements that we've been working on, we realized that it will just take a couple more quarters before it really starts making a difference in the marketplace and creates a strong enough pull for us, right. So those were the two main comments on that. Number one, a number of deals pushed that we didn't expect to push out of the quarter and number two, a lot of the improvements we are making in terms of creating a competitive advantage for ourselves will take just a bit more time before it makes a difference in the marketplace.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then, what are you thinking about kind of the approach to your sales team and a new head of sales in terms of how you think any changes that you would like to see?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, without commenting on any particular change, Allen, I would say in general, what we have been working towards in the last two, three quarters since the beginning of this calendar year is driving some culture changes, right? We want to become a lot more energetic, a lot more customer-centric, very focused on customers and generally, more passionate, more enthusiasm, more execution and innovation-oriented. Just driving a lot of those changes. We just want more energy within the company. And also lot more internal teamwork, right? We want sales and R&D and services to be on the same page to work together to help the company and the customer. So a lot of the changes we have done during the last ten months or so have all been driving the company towards that. And as far as the sales team is concerned, there have been no major changes in the sales team other than the leadership change. We plan to invest a little bit more in our sales in terms of more quota-carrying sales reps all over the world. And we'll do that gradually along with our product improvements as our products become more and more competitive and more and more we have an advantage in the marketplace, we will make sure we drive that sales as well. But at the moment, we are looking at all regional coverages. And we want to make sure that we are covering the market well, and we are driving our sales forward with a lot of energy.
Allen Klee: Okay. Do you have numbers on the number of hotel rooms and point-of-sale devices for the quarter? And do you have any goals on how you would like to grow them?
Ramesh Srinivasan: It’s about 250,000 rooms and around 42,000 terminal end-points. And as far as growth goes, as revenue grows, so do our end-points. So, on average they should grow on a similar – kind of similar trajectory.
Allen Klee: Okay, thank you. Can you talk a little about your payment gateway and to the extent you think that that gives you a competitive advantage?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. Our payment gateway more than it giving us a competitive advantage, Allen, what it does is it makes our product development efforts a lot more effective. Instead of developing payment gateway-related modules in each of our products, both in property management and in point-of-sale, we are able to make that a common module, so it makes it a lot more – much higher velocity development and we don't need to do it in each of our products. That's the main advantage it gives us. And therefore, our reaction to the marketplace is a lot quicker than otherwise. So that's the biggest advantage we get with a common pay gateway and we are now, I would say, in the 7th, 8th, 9th inning of creating a lot of the pay-at-the-table and EMV enhancements and working with a whole lot of other gateways and processes and getting ready for various markets, including Canada and even various markets in the U.S. A lot of those efforts that have gone on over the last few quarters are kind of towards the end now. So we should be in very good shape with respect to our payment gateway going into the next fiscal year.
Allen Klee: Okay, great. And then, with the large hotel chain opportunity, what are the factors that you think are key in terms of winning business there and accelerating adoption?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, sure. So as you know, Allen, once we are named as one of the preferred vendors for a major hotel chain, there is still a little bit of selling to do with each of their individual hotels and their franchises and there is still work left to be done there. And with a couple of major hotel chains that we are making good progress with, a lot of their budget cycles align with the calendar year. So we expect hotels going live with our solutions to really accelerate towards the beginning of next calendar year, which is the last quarter of our fiscal year. So we expect that to keep going forward. We are making good progress with the couple of hotel chains that we are already signed up with. And there are a number of other significant size hotel and cruises and resorts opportunities in our HRC vertical that we are making reasonably good progress with. So there is a lot of promise in terms of how HRC as a vertical will drive our revenue growth forward during the coming quarters.
Allen Klee: Okay. Any comments on how you are thinking about expanding sales internationally?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. So internationally, along with our hotel, resorts, cruise vertical, international represents a major revenue growth area for us. We are pretty well positioned in Asia, because we have a significant presence there. And the fact our India development center has about 130 employees helps a lot, because the more you can help a market locally, the better off you are. So Asia, we are well positioned and I think, we are much closer to revenue growth in Asia, compared to Europe. Europe, we will grow along with the opportunities. There are a couple of opportunities we are working on that is going to help fuel growth in Europe and we will grow our sales staff along with the growth. We will be disciplined with that growth effort. And as far as Latin America is concerned, that is an area where we have to get started, where we hope to get started during the next couple of quarters.
Allen Klee: Okay. Any comment on the progress on the rollout of the various rGuest solutions? And how you see that – how them happening?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. So as far as rGuest is concerned, I will say, Buy is the farthest ahead. rGuest Buy is making very good progress, especially with a couple of big food service management customers. Stay is working well in limited services hotels. And our major install with one major customer there is going well, well. And we are now planning to expand the product to other limited service hotel opportunities as well. Now as we need a couple of more – few more quarters before we are ready with the full-service hotels as far as rGuest Stay is concerned. So I would say Buy is the farthest ahead. Stay is doing well in limited services hotels. And Stay, like I told you is making good progress as a common module.
Allen Klee: Okay, and in terms of the productivity you're seeing out of the Indian IT center, how do you feel about that now?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, India development center, like you know, like in terms of managing – creating and managing a captive development center, I have had a couple of previous experiences with us. And I would say this is going better than expected. We've been there now for about four plus months and it's quite remarkable how much impact they've already made and that will only exponentially continue to increase as we go forward.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then, in terms of how I think about the longer-term business model here, can you – I think I've heard you say in the past some things about like how the company could – you think in the long run have margins similar to like large enterprise software companies. But is there anything about the company? Could you maybe define that and - or if there is anything different about, I don't know the hardware component here or something that makes you think it would be a little different?
Anthony Pritchett: Yes. Allen, what we've said and what we continue to expect is that, we can get to a point where we can grow revenue 10% to 20%. We don't see that there is anything standing in our way, notwithstanding the current year lower guidance. We are going to have some bumps in the road, but we should be able to get to that 10% to 20% growth rate on revenue. And as far as earnings go, our margin – we've really given an indication that we can be profitable and that we can earn somewhere between 10% and 15% of revenue on the bottom0line and the bottom-line being our adjusted earnings from operations metric. And we feel like those numbers are reasonable based on other similar companies to us, other enterprise software companies, software and SaaS companies. So there is plenty of them out there in the market that are growing revenue and are profitable and that's what we're modeling ourselves after.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Phil Bernard from Eilers & Krejcik. Your line is open.
Phil Bernard: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call. I am not hearing, can you hear me?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, Phil. We can hear you. Nice to talk to you.
Phil Bernard: There we go. It looks like recurring revenues continues to grow pretty well year-over-year and sequentially. What is driving most of that in terms of what product and what customer segment?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, I mean, all our products drive that. All our products, all our software sales involves recurring revenue. And they could fall in two buckets. Some customers prefer on-premise solutions, which normally involves a license and maintenance and a lot of customers growing, more and more customers prefer the SaaS solutions where they pay us a SaaS recurring revenue. So both those buckets, license maintenance and SaaS revenue contributes to our recurring revenue growth and we continue to expand our customer base. Every quarter, we are adding more customers to our customers list and that will continue to grow recurring revenue, both the SaaS revenue and the license maintenance revenue.
Phil Bernard: Okay, okay. So there is not one customer segment as in hotels or casino or restaurants that's pushing further or stronger than the others?
Ramesh Srinivasan: In general, like Tony was describing, our revenue growth, we expect during the next, call it one to two years, a lot of our growth is going to come from the Hotel, Resorts, Cruise segment. A lot of our revenue growth is going to come from international and as we continue to innovate more, we expect more growth from Food Services and the Gaming segments that we are in as well. And all the revenue growth carry a recurring revenue competent as well. So, because we are a software company, every sale we make contributes to the growth of recurring revenue.
Phil Bernard: Got it. Got it. And...
Ramesh Srinivasan: And we expect our SaaS recurring revenue to grow at a faster rate because that's where the world is going towards -- more towards the cloud and SaaS-based solutions.
Phil Bernard: Sure, sure. And then, you guys have been very gracious with your time. So, I'll leave it with this one. It looks like sequentially margins within the subscription, maintenance and support vertical came back a little bit sequentially though they were up year-over-year. How do you look at margins within that business going forward?
Anthony Pritchett: Yes, they vary – not much, Phil. They vary a point or two quarter-to-quarter and that's really due to the timing of when customers go live and certain GAAP accounting entries when we have certain things deferred on the balance sheet for various reasons. That margin over time should grow, because it's a pretty scalable revenue line. We don't have to incur as much cost as we grow revenue. There is a lot of capacity in our datacenters. As the SaaS revenue grows and we have more customers installed and our support team that supports the phone calls from customers, that's a pretty scalable team as well at this point. So, you should see that margin kind of creep up over time.
Phil Bernard: Got it. Great. That’s it for me guys. Thank you.
Anthony Pritchett: Thanks, Phil.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Phil.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ramesh, President and CEO for closing remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Danielle. And as always, thank you all for joining us this afternoon and all the confidence you have placed in us with your investments. We sincerely appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our fiscal 2018 third quarter results. Thank you.

Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Norberto, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2018 third quarter results and our path forward. Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. Revenue as compared to last fiscal year's third quarter decreased 6.4% to $31.3 million leading to a GAAP net loss of $1.9 million or a loss of $0.08 per share compared to a loss of $1.7 million or $0.08 per share in Q3 fiscal 2017. This drop in revenue was primarily due to lower product sales which decreased 18.5%, as well as lower professional services revenue which decreased 17.6%. The increase in momentum we continue to see in our business everybody is yet to be manifested in our top line revenue numbers. In spite of that our adjusted earnings from operations metric for the quarter which is a measure of revenue minus all expenses, minus all capital expenditures improved over the comparable period last fiscal year. If we exclude the one-time capital expense of $700,000 incurred to double the capacity of our India Development Center which commenced operations during June 2017. We expect to finish this fiscal year at the lower end of our previous guidance of $130 million to $134 million, and expect to achieve the stated goal of Q4 FY18 being our first quarter of positive adjusted earnings from operations. Our India Development Center currently has about 200 employees on board, more than 90% of them in technical R&D related positions. We expect to reach out new capacity of 330 employees before the end of June 2018. We expect greatly increased cost effective R&D to be a major growth driver for us during the short, medium and long-term. The hospitality industry remains hungry for a world-class software technology vendor and we intend to be the one. We continue to increase our technical software development capacity in the U.S. as well as we make progress on converting ourselves into a software technology powerhouse in the hospitality industry. We have increased our product development capacity by nearly 60% since the beginning of fiscal 2018 and expect to end the fiscal year in March with double the capacity we started the year with. During this transition we continue to have control over and manage our cost structure by moving away from the use of expensive third-party contract personnel in favor of building our own employee base, a model that makes a lot more sense for our future. We expect our employees to increase in their proficiency with our products and technology in general, exponentially overtime. Our customer service efforts have shown good improvement during the past couple of quarters. Simplifying the organization structure within professional services, enabling greater and more direct accountability for quality of implementations and customer satisfaction levels continues to yield good results. We are steadily becoming more cost effective, capable and efficient with our ability to support all customer needs. We are now in a much better position to support larger clients into new markets and deliver quality solutions at a high velocity with less resources. We continue to strengthen our management team, we are a lot more cohesive and execution focused now. As you are aware, Don DeMarinis joined us last week as our Senior Vice President of Sales, Americas. Don joins us with extensive experience in hospitality technology sales. He was previously Vice President, Sports & Entertainment and Food Service Management at Oracle Micros and Vice President, Leisure & Entertainment at Micros prior to its acquisition by Oracle. Then he led sales increases of 30% per annum. In the few days he has been with us we have already seen his ability to reenergize our sales teams and get going on our revenue growth initiatives. Going forward our Asia Pacific and EMEA Managing Director and our Global Marketing Head will continue to report directly to me. We have enormous untapped potential for growth in the Asia and EMEA regions. I plan on spending substantially increased time in both regions during this calendar year. Our flagship POS product, InfoGenesis, remains our main sales driver as we continue to grow our penetration into the branded full service hotel market and in international regions. Our relationship with a couple of large international hotel chain has grown during the past few months creating another good growth opportunity. Along with InfoGenesis, our rGuest Buy platform providing self-service guest facing point of sale solutions is growing by leaps and bounds. While continuing to be increasingly successful in the food service management vertical we have now expanded the reach of rGuest Buy to the casino market segment as well. We've installed rGuest Buy in a few pilot and production sites at large casinos in North America showcasing the capability of the product to move upstream into larger, more complicated installations which naturally come with more functionality and interphase demands. During calendar 2017 we added about 80 new customers to our portfolio and significantly expanded our business levels with about 200 customers. During Q3 FY18, that is the recent December quarter, we closed several important new deals, including a new customer, Camel Back Resort, who own a large full season lodge with a convention center and adventure park, a largely expanded business partnership with OCH Casinos involving a new property opening and purchase of new products, Holiday Inn Airport-Gulfport, who became one of our new InfoGenesis customers and is the first one to be implementing our new self-deployable InfoGenesis services model, and our current customer, Resorts World, installing rGuest Buy kiosks in their new upcoming casino opening in the classical area, New York. During calendar 2017 we averaged more than one competitive replacement sales contract per week. That competitive replacement sales contract count was multiple times higher during the last four months of calendar 2017 by the starting September compared to the first 8 months of the calendar year. We are now involved in significantly more discussions, demos and presales activities with customers compared to about six months ago. It's only a matter of time before that increased business momentum starts translating into tangible and significant topline growth. Customer registrations for our user conference next week have increased by more than 20% compared to last year. About 45% of the customer attendees will be attending our user conference for the first time. Considering that about half of our extensive customer base still uses only one of our products we have good growth opportunities from within our customer base as well. The number of partner sponsors for the upcoming user conference events next has increased from 28 last year to 33 this year. Led by Don DeMarinis and the increased energy level, passion and drive he starting instilling in our sales teams; and Rob Jacks, whose increased commitment to customer service is being seen and felt by our customers and backed up by an expanding technical talent base who are driving our products and technical services forward with increasing momentum every passing week I'm confident we will be able to grow consistently and profitably in the future. We expect to leverage our improving operational efficiencies, rapidly increasing product development capacity, motivated and driven sales and services organizations and ever improving ability to address new verticals and growing contributions from recurring SaaS and maintenance revenues to improve overall performance, financial results and shareholder value. We are well on our way towards becoming a more energetic, more customer centric and generally a more passionate and innovative engineering driven company. The management team, a majority of whom have joined us during the past 9 months is leading together in one direction and driving a more cohesive teamwork oriented high work ethic culture. We are now more enthusiastic than ever before about our future, our near-term and long-term growth, our profitability potential and our increasing ability to address the needs and trends impacting the hospitality industry. We continue to believe this business has massive opportunities to create substantial shareholder value. My personal decision during November 2017 to double down on my February 2017 decision to buy a significant amount of Agilysys's shares was a well thought out financial decision. I was not under any contractual obligation to do so. The hospitality industry is a great place to grow a business around, there continues to be a growing demand for world-class software solutions. We are setting ourselves up well to drive home the opportunities before us. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Tony Pritchett, to review our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Anthony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter fiscal 2018 revenue was $31.3 million, a 6.4% decrease from total net revenue of $33.4 million in the comparable prior year period. The decline in topline largely reflects a decrease in product revenue and services revenue, however both grew sequentially compared to Q2 of this fiscal year. Total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 8% of total fiscal 2018 third quarter revenue. With regard to endpoints, we currently serviced about 255,000 rooms in around 44,000 terminal endpoints, compared to 244,000 rooms and 38,000 terminal endpoints in Q3 of last year. Looking at revenue in greater detail, product revenue decreased by $1.9 million compared to Q3 fiscal 2017 or 18.5% to $8.2 million and represented 26% of total revenue during the quarter. The decline in product revenue is mostly attributable to hardware. Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue are recurring revenue, increased $1 million or 6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, attributable mostly to SaaS revenue. Total recurring revenue represented 55% of total net revenues compared to 48.5% of total net revenues in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. The recurring revenue growth was driven by a 26% increase in SaaS revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. SaaS revenues comprised around 29% of total recurring revenues compared to around 24% of total recurring revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We are pleased with this growth in our SaaS-based recurring revenue and as we continue to expand our customer base, our recurring revenue will continue to grow both, the SaaS revenue and the recurring license maintenance revenue. Professional services revenue decreased $1.3 million, or 17.6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. $1.1 million of this decrease is due to services revenue recognized in Q3 of fiscal 2017 or services provided in quarters prior to that or contractual commitments precluded revenue recognition until that quarter. The remaining $200,000 decline is due to timing of customer installations and implementation projects. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold decreased 8.9% or $1.5 million in the third quarter versus the prior year period, mainly as a result of lower revenue. I would like to point out that cost of goods sold decreased for support, maintenance and subscription services inspite of its 6% revenue growth reflecting success with the cost structure initiatives we have been working on. This led to a total gross profit decrease of $600,000 or 3.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Taking a closer look, products gross profit decreased $1.1 million with gross profit margin decreasing to 16.4%, primarily as a result of lower product sales coupled with $300,000 of higher amortization of developed technology related to the previously announced general available of the latest version of rGuest Buy sales solution and the $6.8 million of related software development cost that was placed into service in September of 2017. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $1.3 million, leading to a total gross margin of 76% on the back of the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers and the positive impact of the changes mentioned earlier. Professional services gross profit decreased by $0.8 million on the back of the lower professional services revenue, while gross profit margin decreased 20.4%, both compared to Q3 of fiscal 2017. However, we've begun to realize the benefits of restructuring our professional services workforce into teams responsible for named customer accounts as evidenced by our gross profit increase of $400,000 sequentially compared to Q2 of this fiscal year. Resulting gross margins for the fiscal 2018 third quarter of 49.9% compares favorably to 48.6% in the prior year period, and keeps us in line with stated guidance for our annual gross margins to be in the low 50% range. This improvement in gross margin is a positive trend for the company that should continue. Excluding the effect of software amortization from cost of goods sold, gross margin would have been 58.4% compared to 55.5%. Looking at operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements in restructuring, severance and other charges, the third quarter saw a 13.6% increase in operating expenses to $18.7 million, compared to $16.5 million in the prior year period. However, operating expenses, last fiscal Q3 included reversals of stock compensation and bonus expense related to forfeiture [ph] due to the departure of former executives. The important benchmark for us was fiscal Q4 of last year when we began executing on our operational plan and quarter-over-quarter comparisons will be more meaningful starting next quarter. Operating expenses excluding the charges for legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges decreased by 9.3% from $20.6 million when compared to Q4 of 2017. Product development expenses increased by $400,000 or 6.2% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year but decreased by 13.5% in comparing to Q4 of last fiscal year despite the 50% increase in our engineering development capacity. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $700,000 or 14.4% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year but decreased by 15.7% when comparing to fiscal Q4 of last year. General and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million or 66.2% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year but about $1.8 million of that increase is due to stock compensation and bonus expense which was a benefit to expense in Q3 of last year due to the forfeiture [ph] related to the departure of former executives. Comparing G&A to Q4 of last year it has decreased by 1.1%. We reported an operating loss of $3.6 million for the third quarter which includes $1.6 million in depreciation, amortization, legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges. Net loss for the third quarter was $1.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share, including a $1.6 million tax benefit related primarily to the recent tax legislation compared to a net loss of $1.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was a gain of $2.1 million for the third quarter compared to a gain of $3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA saw a 27.8% improvement through the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and importantly, a $2.3 million improvement compared to Q4 of last year when adjusted EBITDA was negative. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement; cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, was $37.6 million, compared to $49.3 million at March 31, 2017. And as we mentioned on the last call, we expect to end this fiscal year with a cash balance that is at/or slightly above $38.5 million. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $7.3 million invested in the development of proprietary software and approximately $5.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment and internal-use software development. And in terms of our NOLs, we currently carry approximately $200 million of NOL carry forwards with a full valuation allowance on our books, this will help us remain liable for only taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our current NOLs expire between the fiscal years 2031 and 2038. It is important to note that the tax law in place stipulates that all pre-existing NOLs prior to our fiscal 2019 can be utilized at 100% and are not subject to the 80% limit that any future created NOLs will be subject to. As it relates to our free cash flow, we expect free cash flow and adjusted earnings from operations to closely mere each other on an annual basis with the exception of any onetime cash payments like restructuring. As a reminder, free cash flow tends to the lagging of earnings from operations during the first half of most fiscal years and then getting ahead of it during the second half reflecting the timing of our annual recurring revenue billing and collection cycles. Looking at adjusted earnings from operations, I'm pleased with our performance given that even on $2.1 million of lower revenue our AOE would have improved compared to Q3 of fiscal 2017 had we not invested approximately $700,000 in TP&E for the expansion of our India Development Center. This reflects the positive impact that our operational initiatives are having on the cost structure of our company. In closing, we remain encouraged about the opportunities ahead of us to further leverage our existing customer base, engage with new customers and enter new markets. We feel good about the state of our business as the fundamental we have been focusing on and discussing with you continue to improve. Our efforts to lower cost as a percentage of revenue streamline operations realign our overall cost structure and further leverage our resources, as well as maintaining a disciplined investment criteria across the business are beginning to take hold. We are enthusiastic about the progress we've made towards transforming Agilysys into a more customer centric partner, a company big enough to be a stable partner to even the largest hospitality enterprise but nimble and agile enough to respond to their needs quickly. And with a healthy balance sheet that includes nearly $40 million in cash and no debt, we are well positioned to achieve sustained profitability. With that, let's turn the call over to operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee with Sidoti. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: You have a longer term growth target of revenue I think of around 10% to 20%, what has to happen, what factors have to change between where you are now to make you more comfortable that you think you will be at that level?
Ramesh Srinivasan: We are getting close Allen, the business momentum that we have now, the number of sales and other discussions we are having with customers; that momentum translating itself into revenue growth, we feel that we are quite close and then we can sustain it quite well in the future as well. For example, just a couple of areas; number one, our current customers -- many -- I mean hundreds of customers use only one of our products, in order to sell more to them our product innovation velocity, our product innovation speed has to increase a bit more than what it is now. There are many product aspects here in the process of improving that will give both customers a reason to buy from us and they want to buy more from us because like -- one major customer told us they want to reduce the number of small vendor we are dealing with, it is just us getting a few more of the product innovation aspects done. Now the big hotel chains that we are working with but the shift to the new calendar year is when their budgets open up. So that is going to give us a drive for our revenue growth. We have enormous opportunities in international regions and in each of those regions there are a couple of more product gaps that have to be filled in order for us to really make a difference in Asia and EMEA and we are well on our way towards doing that. We have opportunities in FSM, in food service management, for which again there are a few more things we have to get done in InfoGenesis and our rGuest Buy before those opportunities kick-in. So we are making progress towards that, the business momentum is there, our customer conversations are positive, we are not losing too many deals we are participating in, it is just that there are just a few more of these final steps in the product, in the services teams we'll have to get done and we feel good about how close we are now.
Allen Klee: For the Indian Development Center, can you comment a little what you're seeing out of it so far and how that potentially translate into higher sales?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Allen, if I have to pick among all the factors that will drive higher sales and higher revenue from sales; if I list out all the factors and if I'm allowed to pick only one I would pick product delivery velocity because currently it is almost an internal challenge for us, the more we can get done in our products the more we can grow the company and in order to get that done we have to do it in a cost effective manner as well. So what is going on with our India Development Center is, we have grown it to about 200 people in the last 7 months or so. So the average experience level there with our products is about somewhere between three and four months. So every passing week their productivity, their understanding of our products and what our customers' needs are is increasing every week. Some products they are making a bigger difference than the other and also we have made the transition from what was a very costly contract personal base for us and we are making that transition to the India Development Center which also is making progress every week. So in terms of products India Development Center is contributing to every product we have, both are well established set of products and our rGuest set of products and their contributions and productivity levels are improving every week.
Allen Klee: And then with the large hotel customers, can you comment a little more on what's going on during -- what is anything else you need to do and how to think about how that could grow overtime?
Ramesh Srinivasan: In two ways Allen, number one, currently our large big hotel chains are mostly focused on the InfoGenesis product; so we have an opportunity there to introduce our other products to them which we are in the process off. For example, rGuest Buy is now in the lab stage with one of those major hotel chains. So we do have an opportunity to introduce other products as we make the relationship stronger. But even before that our current implementations of InfoGenesis where we are replacing competitor systems in those hotel chains, our initial implementations have gone well and as they continue to go well it becomes easier and easier to convince the other ownership and the other hotels in that chain which are beginning to pick up our product one by one and that pace has definitely has picked up in the last three/four months because our initial implementations have gone quite well and now we expect that pace to pick up in international regions as well. And the fact that the budget cycle has now changed to the start of the calendar year is also very helpful.
Allen Klee: I heard you say that you plan to spend more time internationally; could you talk a little about just -- what the strategy is there?
Ramesh Srinivasan: I mean well more than 90% of our revenue as you know, Allen, comes from the North American region, it comes mostly from the U.S. So in the Americas we have to grow the opportunities and pay more focused attention on each of our sales opportunities in the U.S. We are just about getting some of our product gaps fixed in order to get going in Canada, so that's going to be a major area of growth for us and we have opportunities to get started in the Latin American region as well. So those are pretty big tasks that we need undivided attention on which is what Don is going to be focused on, and while he does that I'm going to be spending relatively more time focusing on Europe and Asia and making sure that we push that forward so that our revenue growth possibility there are also driven forward. We have good leadership there that is running well but relatively I'm going to be spending a bit more time in international regions than I have been doing so far.
Allen Klee: Regarding Don, your new head of America sales, he looks like a very good hire. Any thoughts about just what this change in approach could be for sales?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, Allen, we agree with you, Don is a very good hire and the management team really liked him a lot and our board liked him a lot and we are really excited about the hire. Number one, he'll bring a lot more energy to our sales activities because I think one of the aspects of revenue growth for us, he is just driving sales with a more passion and energy and making sure that we are uncovering all the opportunities and paying complete attention to it and he obviously has a terrific track record of success in Micros [ph], highly respectable company that really did well, that grew from our kind of size to a $1 billion company and Don was part of that group. So he understands revenue growth well, he understands what it takes for a company to get better and grow. And also he is a very good team player, very cohesive and he will build great relationships internally with our product development, product management services teams; so he makes our team more cohesive and he brings a lot more energy to the sales team and he arguably is the most knowledgeable person in this area now in our management team as well. So yes, we are very happy about hiring him.
Allen Klee: For your adjusted number that you guide to -- EBITDA minus CapEx and capitalized software; what do you anticipate changing by the end of the year compared to like where you are now that will turn that positive?
Anthony Pritchett: As you've seen throughout the year our cost structure has changed a bit and especially as it relates to current cost that was compared to Q4 of last fiscal year our cost has come down and these amount and especially as a percentage of revenue. So we're looking into the quarter that we're about to enter or we're in right now, our fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, there is a component of revenue that obviously impacts that and then there is a continued decline in our cost structure that leads us to positive adjusted earnings from operations. One component that goes into that number, keep in mind is TP&E and development of software. I mean as we've transitioned our expensive external contract developers to internal resources, especially in India, that brings the amount of investment required to develop our software products down, that trend should continue.
Ramesh Srinivasan: So when you think of it sequentially there are three aspects to that AOE; one is revenue, one is overall expenses and one is capital expenditure. We obviously expect sequentially revenue to be higher in Q4 and we expected expenses to be down and also capital expenditures to be down.
Allen Klee: I know you don't pay taxes today, I heard you say something about your NOLs that you can use the 100% of them; is there anything else in the new tax code that we should think about for -- that could have an impact on potential tax rate when you turn profitable?
Anthony Pritchett: Since we have such a large NOL carry forward and the one that we have today doesn't expire until 2031, they start to expire in our fiscal 2031. We should benefit from that NOL for quite a while now. So if we turn profitable we'll have years of benefit from that NOL carry forward. So the new tax legislation doesn't affect us all that much, there was a nuance [ph] in the tax law that caused us to recognize our tax benefit this quarter, specifically related to indefinite live intangibles but effectively we've got large DTA on the books, it's fully valued at this point so we'll continue in the current kind of situation we are today where we benefit from not paying much in taxes, especially in the U.S.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Phil Bernard with Eilers & Krejcik. Your line is now open.
Phil Bernard: You mentioned the market increase in competitive replacement to sales contracts this year roughly one every week. Just curious if you could speak to any trends that you see either with respect to markets or our product verticals?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Product verticals I would say mostly in the InfoGenesis POS area, that's where most of our competitive replacement comes in. Here and there lower percentage, we do have BMS [ph] replacements where on visual one product replaces a competitor product as well. So I would say a big majority of the replacements do come in the InfoGenesis POS area. And so just giving you a slightly broadened commentary on that, we are in a very unique space in this marketplace which is why we are so bullish on Agilysys in the not too big, not too small place, we are almost the only player, we have much bigger competitors than us who are in the $1 billion kind of annual revenue and there are customer services issues associated with those competitors because of which customers want to switch to us. And then again, we have a bunch of smaller competitors who are struggling to scale and so there are issues associated with that when customers want to get more done and they are not able to scale they like to switch to us. So that's where our competitor replacement opportunities come from. For now I would say they are mostly in the point of sales side and a little bit on the property management system side as well; but in future quarters I expect that to pick up on the PMS side as well.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Allen Klee with Sidoti. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: With products sales how do you visualize the trend in that going forward?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Allen, product sales are tough, I mean that's the last couple of millions of our quarterly revenue every quarter, it's the toughest part of us trying to grow revenue. When you think about product sales, basically the way that typically works is we execute a contract with the customer and we deliver the product and then there is other times when customers will execute a contract and they don't want the product at that point of time and so it's delivered at some point in the future. So there is a lot of different dependencies when it comes to product sales and how that actually impacts our current quarter revenue but overtime what we expect is that we'll continue to grow our customer base, we'll continue to sell into our existing customer base. And most of our sales -- most of our contracts with customers include one product or another thinking about product revenue. So it's a matter of really growing our customer base and penetrating our existing customer base even more and as we grow our customer base [indiscernible].
Allen Klee: Do you provide any sense of like a pipeline of like deals you're working on or like -- or that -- any type of qualitative thing like that of a pipeline that gives you with sense of how you feel now, maybe versus how you felt a quarter ago or a year ago of the future outlook?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Absolutely. We do manage that very closely, internally though we don't discuss that number externally. Yes Allen, in our weekly sales schedule call we go through those numbers in a great degree of detail and to just -- and we don't discuss for the exact numbers outside but just to give you a qualitative idea of that compared to six months ago and even compared to say the September/October timeframe, the graph has definitely picked up, there is no question about that, there is just a lot more activity, our pipeline is really beginning to turn the corner and there is just a lot more activity for us to work on now than we had three to six months ago. Qualitatively there is no question about it and it is just a matter of time before revenue actually catches up with that. We are definitely working on a bigger pipeline and more opportunities now globally, not just in the U.S., especially in Asia and in U.S. we definitely have a much more -- much aider [ph] pipeline we are working with now than say six months ago.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So I would like to return the call to Mr. Ramesh for any closing remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Samra [ph], thank you for your help with the call. And as always, thank you all for joining us this afternoon and for the confidence you have placed in us. We sincerely appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our fiscal 2018 full year results. Thank you so much.

Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Norberto. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter results, our future outlook, and expectation. Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. Taking a quick look at our financial results. Revenue as compared to last fiscal year's fourth quarter increased 4.8% to $32.1 million, leading to a GAAP net loss of $0.2 million or a loss of $0.01 per share compared to a loss of $5.3 million or $0.23 per share in Q4 of fiscal 2017. This improvement in GAAP loss included a onetime noncash gain of approximately $2 million related to changes in our tax provision as a result of the recently passed Tax Act. This brought our full year fiscal 2018 revenue to $127.4 million, in line with full year fiscal 2017 revenue, and led to a GAAP net loss of $8.4 million or $0.37 per share compared to a GAAP net loss of $11.7 million or $0.52 per share for full year fiscal 2017. The total annual onetime noncash gain included in our GAAP net loss related to adjustments from the Tax Act was $3.3 million revenue. Revenue for the fourth quarter was driven by a marked increase in our SaaS subscription and annual maintenance recurring revenue, which rose to a quarterly record of $18.1 million, 11% increase over the comparable quarter last fiscal year. This year-over-year quarterly increase in recurring revenue included a 32% increase in SaaS subscription revenue. Our overall recurring revenue base grew by $5.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, our largest single year increase since fiscal 2014 when we transformed our business into a pure-play hospitality industry software provider that we are today. This recurring revenue increase during fiscal 2018 included a 35% increase in full year SaaS subscription revenue compared to fiscal 2017. While the overall fiscal 2018 revenue level was flat compared to fiscal 2017, we achieved a much better revenue mix and higher margins, with higher-margin SaaS and other recurring revenue contributions offsetting the decline in low-margin hardware revenue. With our recurring revenue currently at an all-time high approximately 56% of overall revenue and highly predictable services revenue accounting for approximately 19% of overall revenue, our revenue base continues to become increasingly more predictable. In addition, without the impact of reselling low-margin hardware servers, which is mostly out of our revenue, our revenue mix now is significantly more favorable for achieving profitable growth moving forward. As we have continued to work through our revenue mix changes, our increased business momentum in the marketplace is not yet evident in our top line results. Our various business improvements are more evident in our EBITDA and other profitability metrics. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA gain was $3.1 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.2 million in the prior fiscal year period. Our overall expense levels as a percentage of revenue were lower in Q4 fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year. We are pleased that we achieved positive $0.6 million adjusted earnings from operations, or AOE as we also refer to this metric. We are pleased that we achieved positive $0.6 million AOE in the fiscal fourth quarter, our first such positive AOE quarter since we transformed the company in fiscal 2014. The $4.3 million year-over-year quarterly improvement in AOE from negative $3.8 million in Q4 fiscal '17 to a positive $0.6 million in Q4 of fiscal 2018 as well as the $5.6 million or approximately 48% full year AOE improvement on a flat revenue year are good proof points that the various strategic initiatives we've been working on for the past year or so are positioning Agilysys well for sustainable and consistent medium- and long-term profitable growth. As we mentioned before, adjusted earnings from operations is essentially adjusted EBITDA minus capital spend, or stated differently, a measure of our overall revenue minus overall expenses, whether they are capitalized or not, minus capital expenditure and is a comprehensive measure of our business operations performance. Aside from certain exceptional onetime cash expenditure items, AOE is also a good proxy for free cash flow over a full fiscal year period. Our free cash flow tends to be cyclical on a quarterly basis, better in the latter half of the fiscal year compared to quarters one and two due to the invoicing timing of a significant portion of our annual maintenance billing happening during the second half of the fiscal year. The adjusted earnings from operations measure normalizes free cash flow uniformly across the year. Fiscal 2018 was a pivotal year for Agilysys. It was a time of enormous transformation that has positioned the company for medium- and long-term sustainable profitable growth. It was a year in which significant changes were made across just about every aspect of our business. As we have expressed before, our intent and conviction is driven by our belief that we can achieve significant value creation by leveraging our world-class point-of-sale and lodging management software solutions already well established in the marketplace by growing our product development, enhancement, and innovation scale and improving our customer service levels in various global markets. Along those lines, we made consistent good progress on several key priorities throughout fiscal 2018. Let's start with leadership. We've now established and accomplished cohesive management team, all passionately focused on executing our growth plans. We've been fortunate to attract a group of talented leaders during the past few months to help us drive future success. This is a testament to the significant opportunity that these leaders see in our business and the positive impact they feel they can make. Regarding R&D, Prabuddha Biswas joined us recently as our CTO based in our Bellevue, Seattle office. He joined us from Alert Logic, one of the nation's leading cloud security providers, where he led the transformation of their core security incident detection engine to leverage machine learning and heuristics and led the effort to revamp their tools used to analyze security incidents. Prabuddha, or PB as he is known, has already made his mark at our Bellevue R&D centers and across the organization, having taken control of the rGuest technology team and leading the oversight of our technology initiatives and strategy. Prabuddha came to us with a lot of positive prior experience, working with offshore development centers as well. In just a few weeks, he has already started to make a noticeable impact in increasing our product development velocity. During the past 12 months, we have more than doubled our R&D resources to enable far greater innovation and product development velocity without any increase in R&D spend as a percentage of revenue. In fact, our R&D spend as a percentage of revenue and sales bookings, even including capitalized software development cost, has declined during the past couple of quarters, proving that we can do more, grow and do so profitably. With more than 450 employees in R&D now, well more than half our employee base, we are now a lot more cost effective and quicker with our product deliverables. And that is clearly helping us serve the various markets we operate in a lot better. We've made good progress on a number of long-pending product enhancements, which were required to tap the enormous growth potential we have in APAC and EMEA. We started, completed and brought more new software added-value modules to the marketplace during the past six months than we did in over three years before. The India Development Center has grown to more than 300 personnel and should be close to the current capacity level of 3-3-0, 330, during the next few weeks. As expected, they're gaining knowledge and command of our products with every passing week and represent a significant competitive advantage for us. Regarding sales, our sales momentum has picked up during the past few months, and it is only a matter of time before that increased momentum starts reflecting in top line growth. Don DeMarinis joined Agilysys earlier this calendar year as Head of Sales Americas. Don brings with him extensive experience in hospitality technology sales, having previously led sales at MICROS, both before and after the Oracle acquisition. During the past few months, we've implemented a lot more discipline, granular and process-oriented sales structure, a well-organized sales forecasting process, reinforced with a significantly higher level of accountability across all departments. All Agilysys departments are now pulling towards the customers and working in lockstep with our sales and services teams. Regarding marketing, Heather Foster, our Head of Marketing, joined us more than a month ago. This is a new position at Agilysys based in our Alpharetta, Atlanta office, that's already become a vital part of our overall business as we become more data-driven, analytical and strategic in our marketing initiatives and in how we leverage the value proposition of our solutions. Heather brings to Agilysys more than 20 years of marketing vision and execution experience across product marketing, go-to-market, content marketing, public relations, demand generation and use of social media at fast-growing technology companies. We've made good recent progress in enhancing our marketing efforts with the new analytical approach that we expect will lead to increased effectiveness and better lead generation. We are also heavily engaged in crafting our marketing messaging to better position Agilysys with customers and to ramp up our lead-generation activities. Last and definitely not the least, we are making good positive strides in transforming our culture into an obsessively customer-focused organization that is engineering- and innovation-driven and dedicated to supporting all our products across all the markets we serve with world-class zeal, excellence in quality standards, with complete commitment and relentless focus. I'm truly pleased to have such a talented, passionate and focused management team in place to enact change and better align our resources with the opportunities we have in front of us to transform Agilysys into a growth-oriented, SaaS-driven, innovative technology solutions company. The opportunities are obviously there for us to act on. Based on my and all our frequent interactions with many of our customers, we know the growing hospitality marketplace is eager for Agilysys to do well. Now looking forward. With respect to fiscal 2019, we expect to build our increasing current momentum and have a successful year with growing top line and improving adjusted earnings from operations, driven by multiple opportunities from certain large strategic accounts, of growing SaaS subscriptions and annual maintenance recurring revenue base, international expansion, increased selling to our large customer base and expanded availability of additional software modules. In accordance with the guidance we provided earlier this afternoon in our earnings press release, we expect to achieve approximately 10% full year top line revenue growth in fiscal 2019 compared to the fiscal 2018 revenue level of $127 million. In addition, we expect our improving operational efficiency will help us improve our full year adjusted earnings from operations by approximately $4 million to $6 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 where our AOE loss was approximately $6 million. That is at the higher end of our AOE guidance range, we expect to be at or close to breakeven AOE for full year fiscal 2019. One note of caution, though. While we do expect Q1 fiscal 2019, our current quarter, to be our third consecutive sequential top line revenue growth quarter, it'll be a tough comparison to Q1 fiscal 2018 where we had the benefit of some nonrecurring onetime product revenue. In addition, we expect Q1 to be quite possibly our only quarter in fiscal 2019 with a negative AOE. Q1 just happens to be expense-heavy for us, with a number of cost events happening during the quarter. While being negative, AOE in Q1 fiscal 2019 will still be a significant improvement over the comparable Q1 period in fiscal 2018. We are starting fiscal 2019 with a strong backlog and increased confidence in our ability to improve sales levels. We therefore expect positive AOE results during the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2019, Q2, Q3 and Q4. We will continue to be prudent and disciplined stewards of our balance sheet. From the fiscal 2018 year-end balance of $39.9 million, our cash and cash equivalents are expected to decline by approximately $3 million to $5 million during fiscal 2019, marking a significant improvement from the $9 million decrease in fiscal 2018 and the double-digit millions of cash loss each year since our balance sheet peak in fiscal 2014. Our working capital cash cycles are typically not favorable to us in Q1 and Q2 every fiscal year. We expect our cash balance to drop to around 30, 3-0, $30 million at the end of the first half of the fiscal year, that is after Q1 and Q2, before improving and ending in the mid- to high 30s at the end of the fiscal year. All things considered, we are pleased with our current improving position in the marketplace. We are happy with what we accomplished in fiscal 2018. A number of transformative improvements and tangible progress are taking place. We especially like our momentum in sales bookings closed during the past few months. We are now well poised to be a sought-out employer of world-class talent, a responsive, fast-moving reliable partner for our customers and vendors and a growing profitable hospitality software solutions provider that unlocks considerable value for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony Pritchett to review our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Anthony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh. To echo Ramesh's comments, we are pleased with the direction we're headed and more confident than ever in our ability to grow top line, drive back growth down to the bottom line and create shareholder value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and throughout the fiscal year, we made significant progress on our key financial priorities, including lowering our overall cost as a percentage of revenue and positioning the company for growth through all of the strategic initiatives Ramesh just explained. Taking a look at our financial results, beginning with our income statement. Fourth quarter fiscal 2018 revenue was $32.1 million, a 4.8% increase from total net revenue of $30.6 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in top line revenue largely reflects an 11.4% increase in recurring revenue to $18.1 million, offsetting a slight decline in product and professional services revenues. On an annual basis, we are happy with our $5.8 million increase in recurring revenue. The decline in our product revenue was mostly due to lower volume with third-party products. This shift in the revenue mix is important to keep in mind. Total recurring revenue represented 56.4% of total net revenues compared to 53% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We are pleased with the all-time high quarterly recurring revenue this quarter and the fact that total revenue rose sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. We are also pleased with our robust SaaS-based revenue growth, which grew at 32% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and 35% for the full fiscal year. SaaS revenues comprised around 30% of total recurring revenues compared to 25% of total recurring revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Product revenue and professional services revenue were both down slightly compared to fiscal 2017's fourth quarter, due mainly to a lower backlog of hardware refreshes in fiscal 2018. Ramesh touched on our recent success with bookings and we expect sales momentum will continue in fiscal 2019, leading to the top line revenue growth. We also expect total recurring revenue to continue to grow and our SaaS revenue growth will continue to outpace the rate of total recurring revenue growth, both of which are important measures or progress for us. With regard to endpoints, we currently service about 260,000 rooms and have approximately 46,000 terminal endpoints or 5% and 17% increase, respectively, compared to Q4 of last year. Total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 7% of total fiscal 2018 fourth quarter revenue. Moving down the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased by 1.2% or $0.2 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year period, mainly as a result of increased amortization of our developed technology, with certain versions going into service during the fiscal year and beginning their amortization period. I would like to point out that cost of goods sold decreased 4.1% for support, maintenance and subscription services in spite of the revenue growth, reflecting the success we are having with our cost initiatives. This led to a total gross profit increase of $1.3 million or 8.2% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin improved 160 basis points to 52.2% compared to 50.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Going forward, for fiscal year 2019, we expect growth in the high-margin recurring revenue stream to offset the impact of increasing amortization related to developed technology. And we expect gross profit margins to continue in this range. Excluding the impact of software amortization from cost of goods sold, gross margin would have been 60.5% compared to 58.1%, a measure we're internally focused on, as we feel it reflects the improved quality of our revenue and ability to control cost. Taking a closer look. Products gross profit decreased $0.6 million, with gross profit margin decreasing 17.9%, primarily as a result of higher amortization of developed technology. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2 million, leading to a total gross margin of 77.4% on the back of the scalable nature of our infrastructure, supporting and hosting customers and the positive impact of the changes mentioned earlier. Professional services gross profit decreased by $0.1 million on the back of the lower professional services revenue, with gross profit margin decreasing to 21.9%, both compared to Q4 of fiscal 2017. However, consistent with the trend pointed out during our Q3 call, we are now realizing the benefits of restructuring our professional services workforce and the teams responsible for named customer accounts, as evidenced by our gross profit increase of nearly $100,000 sequentially compared to Q3 of this fiscal year. Looking at operating expenses. Excluding the charges for legal settlements and restructuring, severance and other charges, the fourth quarter saw a 10.7% decrease in operating expenses to $18.4 million compared to $20.6 million in the prior year period when we began executing on our operational plan. Product development expenses decreased by $1.2 million or 14% compared to fiscal Q4 of last year, despite the doubling of our engineering development capacity. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.6 million or 12.2% compared to fiscal Q4 of last year, while general and administrative expenses decreased $0.6 million or 10.2% compared to fiscal Q4 of last year. To reiterate what Ramesh said, our overall expense levels as a percentage of revenue were lower in Q4 fiscal 2018 compared to the same period last year. Our expectation in the future is that we will grow revenue at a faster rate than cost increases. We are pleased with our ability to leverage the powerful operating structure of the company and to increase the utilization of our resources and expect to be able to continue leveraging our cost and operating structure, while we look to meaningfully grow top line revenue. Our operating loss of $2.2 million for the fourth quarter favorably compares to an operating loss of $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $0.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share, which included a noncash income tax benefit related to the new Tax Act. This compared to a net loss of $5.3 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2018, was $39.9 million compared to $49.3 million at March 31, 2017. And as we mentioned on our last call, we expect it to end this fiscal year with a cash balance at or slightly above $38.5 million. So we are pleased with our ability to manage our liquidity as we continue to invest in the business, including in the development of proprietary software and execute on our initiatives. We expect fiscal 2019 year-end cash and cash equivalents to reflect a decline of approximately $3 million to $5 million from the fiscal 2018 year-end balance of $39.9 million, a significant improvement from the -- over $9 million decline from fiscal 2018. In terms of our NOLs, we continue to carry approximately $200 million of NOL carryforwards, with a full valuation allowance on our books that will help us remain liable for taxes paid only in certain foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our current NOLs expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2038. It is important to note that the tax law in place stipulates that all preexisting NOLs prior to our fiscal 2019 can be utilized at 100% and are not subject to the 80% limit that any future created NOLs will be subject to. As it relates to our free cash flow, we expect the free cash flow and adjusted earnings from operations to closely mirror each other on an annual basis, with the exception of any onetime cash payments like restructuring. And as a reminder, free cash flow tends to lag adjusted earnings from operations during the first half of most fiscal years and then gets ahead of it during the second half, reflecting the timing of our annual recurring revenue, billing and collection cycles. Looking at adjusted earnings from operations. We posted a $0.6 million gain for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a loss of $3.8 million in the prior year period. And on an annual basis, AOE improved to a $6 million loss compared to an $11.6 million loss in fiscal 2017. I'm pleased with our performance, given that even on flat revenue, our AOE improved markedly compared to fiscal 2017. We essentially cut our AOE loss in half, reflecting the positive impact that our operational initiatives are having on the cost structure of our company. Finally, taking a look at our guidance. Our initial revenue forecast for fiscal 2019 full year calls for revenue growth of approximately 10% from fiscal 2018 revenue of $127.4 million. As noted, we are starting fiscal 2019 with a strong backlog and increased confidence in our ability to improve sales levels, especially with the new management team in place. In addition, we continue to forecast strong quarterly SaaS growth, even as that base of revenue continues to get larger. Regarding adjusted earnings from operations, our guidance is for $4 million to $6 million of improvement in fiscal 2019 from the loss of approximately $6 million in fiscal 2018. The higher end of that range would put us right around breakeven AOE. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator. Chelsey?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Allen Klee with Maxim Group.
Allen Klee: I had three questions. The first one is, can you talk a little about the timeline for rolling out new pieces of the rGuest offerings and plans to add any new services or features that you believe can improve your competitive position? The second question is, if you could expand on opportunities to grow with larger hotels internationally and how to think about the impact that, that can have on the overall revenue growth and potential upside to your guidance? And then finally, just some comments on the overall competitive environment and if it's changed in any way.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Allen, thank you. Let me just take those questions one-by-one. As far as the rGuest timeline is concerned, rGuest Buy -- the bookings for rGuest Buy is really beginning to pick up and that product is doing well right now, and we're continuing to add more features and more enhancements to that product. In terms of rGuest Stay hitting the stride, I think, like we told you before, we are a few quarters away from that before rGuest Stay really starts contributing to our revenue growth. In terms of new services and new modules and features, we are just about gone live now with a new Web booking engine that's gone actually live with the customer and we are beginning -- that's an additional software module that we're beginning to sell now. We will also be bringing in a matter of weeks a new kiosk product that's an rGuest Express Kiosk that enables customers to help themselves more and more customer guest-facing functionality. So that new module is coming to the marketplace. We are working on a whole lot of mobile applications that can be attached to our InfoGenesis product. And we're also working on a new golf and spa module that will be additions to all our property management systems, LMS, V One and Stay. So the pace at which we are now doing software modules, the newer ones that are higher margin by nature has really picked up, and they are all beginning to hit the marketplace now one-by-one. So in terms of time line, rGuest Buy is hitting its stride right now. rGuest Stay is a few quarters away. But a few more new rGuest modules are beginning to hit the marketplace now in a matter of weeks. Number two, in terms of opportunities of larger hotels, the upside that we expect from the larger hotels, we accounted for that when we said that our revenue will grow up by 10% or so. We are being conservative with how we estimate the larger hotel will expand the business with us. There was a significant pickup in the last couple of months in terms of competitive replacements. We had our best competitive replacement month in March and our best ever quarter in Q4, and a lot of that came from the larger hotels. So we are assuming that the pace at which the larger hotels are expanding their business with us will continue. The upside will come in adding a couple of more of the larger hotels to that list, and the upside will also come from how well we expand internationally with the larger hotels. So with respect to larger hotels, we expect the expansion to come from Asia and EMEA, and that will contribute to the upside. Now a couple of comments on -- competitive environment hasn't changed much, Allen, right? Our competitive environment still remains very favorable to us. We are perfectly positioned. We are the right-size company, not too big, not too small. We are big enough to provide the kind of stability that customers require and small enough to have that customer service focus that is generally lacking in this industry. So I still consider our competitive positioning quite an advantage to us. And I will tell you, it definitely feels like the rate at which our product development velocity is moving along, especially in the last three, four months, is much better than what our competition is doing in terms of improving their product set. So I would say our products and customer service are getting faster -- are getting better, faster than what our competitors are doing.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Phil Bernard with Eilers & Krejcik.
Phil Bernard: Congrats on a decent period and the significant margin improvement. And just one question today. You mentioned one opportunity to grow the top line and the increasing sales within your customer base. Just wonder if you could maybe provide a little more detail there on maybe what percentage of your current customers have a single product and maybe how that has changed over the last year and maybe your goal going forward over the next year.
Anthony Pritchett: Yes. Phil, this is Tony. Thanks for listening in. So with respect to our current customers, we did feel like there's a significant opportunity there to help grow our revenue and help grow our top line. We still have just over 50% of our customers with one of our products. So that provides a great opportunity for us to go after. There's lot of opportunity to sell rGuest Pay into those customers as well as just all of our other complementary products. So Don, when he came onboard, he's been here for about, what, four months now. That's one of his big initiatives, and we've also got several of our product teams working on initiatives to kind of drive sales into our existing customers with some of our new products that Ramesh mentioned earlier.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Dumont with Archon Capital.
John Dumont: Congrats on the strong SaaS revenue growth. It's great to see the continued growth there and as well as just the increased profitability. A couple of questions here. On the sales strategy, we're curious, as part of your strategy there, are you going back to your current customers and trying to move them over to your SaaS offerings from your on-premise customers? And then as a follow-up to that, we're also curious just have you seen a change in just how new customers are consuming the software? Is there a shift between SaaS and on-premise? Or just curious if you could give some color there.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, sure. Thanks, John. In terms of going to our current customers, I would say the chief highlight, the main highlight there is that we are going to them with a lot more software offerings, right? Following up on Phil's question, our position with our current customers, where about half our customers use only one of our products, hasn't changed much, because a lot of the innovation, a lot of the speeding up of our product development is beginning to hit the marketplace now in the last few months or so. So we just have a lot more software modules to offer to our current customers now, and that's what we're focused on. And most of the demand is for SaaS, right? Compared to on-premise versus SaaS, SaaS is where the general marketplace is. So that is going to continue to drive our SaaS revenue forward. And wherever possible, we do offer customers the option of switching from annual maintenance model to a SaaS model. When it is good for them and it is good for us, it really works out well. But in terms of selling more to our current customer base, the major driver is coming from the fact that there is just a lot more increased pace of innovation and we have a lot more new software modules to offer to them. And also, the product that they're already licensed have improved a lot in the last few months. So that is also beginning to drive our services revenue and customers wanting to upgrade to our newer versions.
John Dumont: Okay. And a couple of follow-ups if you don't mind. On the development side, I know you guys have spent the whole last year really focusing on upgrading the development and the speed of innovation there. And you kind of touched on this a little bit earlier. But curious, do you think you're where you need to be as far as just your development speed, or is there more working to do there? And just curious if you could also provide just a little bit of color in terms of just to have a difference that the -- all the increased capacities in India has put on?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, the increased capacity in India has made a big difference during the last few months. We're just getting a lot more done not only in terms of new requirements that customers have, but also we're acting quicker to all kinds of customer requirements. So that's definitely making a difference, and they're especially making a difference in India and Asia. We're beginning to support those markets a lot better. Now in terms of your first part of your question, it's a matter of continuous improvement, John. I mean, there's never a period where we're going to say we are completely satisfied. We are in a far better position now than we were 12 months ago. We are multiple times more productive now than we were 12 months ago. But it's a continuous improvement process. India can still get better. Our U.S. R&D teams can still get better. We're continuing to attract more talent into our R&D offices. And it's a continuous improvement process. But what I can tell you is we are far better off today than we were six months ago, 12 months ago, and we will continue to improve in the next 3 to 6 months as well. It's a continuous improvement, John.
John Dumont: Great. And then are you planning on adding significant headcount on the R&D side or -- as far as headcount, or are you close to where you want to be there?
Ramesh Srinivasan: We're close to where we want to be now, but that will be driven by revenue growth. Like Tony said in his comments, our plan is to grow revenue at a faster pace than we grow cost. And that applies to R&D as much as it applies to sales and marketing and G&A. So we will carefully continue to expand R&D as our revenue continues to grow as well. And at current level of revenue, we are almost there where we need to be.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tucker Golden with Solas.
Frederick Golden: Ramesh, Tony, Norberto, congratulations on continued progress and look forward to more. I was curious on the India Development Center. What's the current headcount and how far are you towards being fully staffed up there?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, the current headcount is just about at 300 or less, and our capacity there is 330. So we should be building up to 330 in a matter of weeks. We've made a bunch of offers and they are about to join. So they are about to join us. So I would say the current headcount is 300. We should be at our capacity of 330 in a matter of a few weeks.
Frederick Golden: That's great. I know that's a big piece of the puzzle. And I know you've talked about one -- in addition to hotels, one other big growth opportunity is being international, specifically Asia. Just any update there, any more granularity into where you see opportunity and when you think you might be able to begin to address it?
Ramesh Srinivasan: We are beginning to address it already, Tucker. International growth, we saw that happening in Q4, where EMEA had an excellent quarter as far as sales booking goes. And our product sets are beginning to deliver the enhancements that those markets require. So I expect, in the subsequent quarters, international to become an increasing contributor. But that's not the only growth factor we're relying on. Like we said, 50% of our customers have only one product. Our selling to our current customers has also increased, because we have more to offer them. The gaming vertical is doing quite well. So we expect considerable growth there, because generally gaming, which currently constitutes about 50% of our revenue, that industry is doing very well. So there's increased customer demand there. So we expect that to drive our revenue as well. And rGuest Buy as a product is a second offering now we have to the broad-based food services management market. So there, we were a very little dependent on one big customer. Now there are more customers there, who are talking to us with respect to InfoGenesis and Buy. And so there are a lot of areas of growth that we are currently addressing. And all of them, I think, will constitute our growth in this coming next two, three quarters. International is just one piece of the puzzle.
Frederick Golden: That's great. I know you're not guiding out this far today, but as you look into fiscal 2020, do you hope to accelerate on beyond 10% sales growth?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. Most definitely, yes. Yes. Because we like our momentum now and as we continue to improve our products, we continue to improve our people strength and talent level, we are seeing -- we are being -- we're very encouraged with the improvements we are seeing now. And I think that momentum will only continue to increase. I do expect 2020 to be a high double-digit growth year, between 10% and 20%. That's what I...
Frederick Golden: Not the 90s. That's great. It's clear you're laying all the groundwork and making a lot of progress. Just switching gears a little bit, in terms of next year's guidance, Tony, can you give us some color on CapEx and capitalized software development costs?
Anthony Pritchett: Yes. So if you look at our cash flow statement and you look at those two numbers for capitalized PP&E and capitalized software development costs, looking into next year, those numbers will probably come down a bit. We ramped up the India Center this year. That required a descent amount of capitalized PP&E. So that number will come down a bit, not a whole lot, though, because we do have other initiatives to invest in. And then the capitalized software development costs will probably tick down a little bit just as we continue to realize the benefits of our transition from the contractors that we used to have even into early fiscal '18 that are now pretty much gone and everything has kind of completely transitioned to our own internal resources.
Frederick Golden: Okay. And so I'm guessing adjusted EBITDA might be just up very modestly if we're looking at adjusted operating earnings being kind of $4 million or $6 million better with lower CapEx, lower capitalized software development cost. Any line items you can highlight on the income statement where there will be kind of incremental investment or are gross margin still going to be kind of in that 50%, 51% range?
Anthony Pritchett: We think gross margin will probably stay pretty close to where it is now, kind of as we ended the fiscal year. As you look down the P&L, all of our costs, we expect to stay about the same range as a percentage of revenue. There is still some ramping to go with respect to the engineering teams from where we are today. But overall, as a percentage of revenue on an annual basis, we're pretty close to where we're expecting it to be. Keep in mind, there's fluctuations in the quarter. Q1, we've got some additional expenses that come in for certain trade shows and professional fees for things like our annual audit, stuff like that. So it's cyclical to some extent. Some quarters are heavier than others. But on an annual basis, the percentage of revenue should be pretty consistent with where we are now.
Frederick Golden: Okay. Makes sense. And then hopefully, we'd expect to see some operating leverage in 2020?
Anthony Pritchett: Yes, absolutely. And we do feel like we're pretty well set-up at this point with descent operating leverage. As we both mentioned, I think we expect revenue to grow faster than cost.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Even in the FY '19.
Anthony Pritchett: Even in FY '19, absolutely.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Ramesh for closing remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Chelsey. In closing, we enter fiscal 2019 with growing momentum, driven by increasing SaaS and recurring revenue, improving operating margins, a world-class leadership team, expanded R&D capacity and a new work ethic and attitude across the organization, focused on being customer-centric, engineering-driven and devoted to all the markets we serve. Please enjoy a terrific and safe long weekend coming up. We look forward to reporting further progress when we report our first quarter results a couple of months from now. Thank you.

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramesh Srinivasan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Agilysys. Ramesh, please go ahead.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Norberto. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2019 first quarter results, some analysis of our recent past, our future outlook and expectations. Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. To begin with a quick review of our financial results. Revenue was a record $34 million, a slight increase of $0.1 million compared to last fiscal year’s first quarter, leading to a GAAP net loss of $1.7 million or a loss of $0.08 per share comparing favorably to a loss of $3 million or $0.13 per share in Q1 of fiscal 2018. Revenue this quarter was driven by a marked increase in recurring revenue, which rose about 7.6% to $17.9 million, that is $17.9 million, including a 19% increase in SaaS-based subscription revenue. Recurring revenue accounted for about 53% of total net revenue this quarter, increasing from approximately 49% of total net revenue for the same period in fiscal 2018. With the predictable and repeatable services revenue, again, accounting for slightly more than 20% of total net revenue, close to three-fourth of our revenue remains easy to forecast. The increase in recurring revenue also helped improve the gross margin level from 49.2% in the prior year period to 52.6% this quarter. We expect to sustain the recurring revenue increases in the future as well. Our customer retention rates continue to improve. Given the growing preference of our customers for SaaS-based installs, we also expect SaaS-based subscription revenue to grow significantly faster than the overall recurring revenue growth rate. We would suggest not reading too much significance into the fact that we have now had two first quarters, in fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2019, meaning two consecutive June ending quarters, where revenue have been at record levels. This is more of a coincidence than an indication of any significant seasonality in our top line. While our cash flows tend to be seasonal, with the second half of each fiscal year being more favorable to us in terms of working capital-related cash flow fluctuation, we don't see any such seasonality with respect to top line revenue. Whatever good or not so good revenue levels we have seen in the past quarters, they are only indicative of performance in that particular quarter and are not due to any significant seasonality inherent in the business. However, what will be important to take note of is the fact that this is our third consecutive sequential revenue growth quarter, which is reflective of our increasing business momentum, our increased R&D capacity, improved product development and innovation velocity, exponentially greater customer service and support levels and greater focus on all regions we are doing business in are all contributing towards much better business momentum, which has helped grow our revenue levels for three sequential quarters in a row. Adjusted EBITDA improved by about 1.5 million compared to Q1 of last fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA has been about 3.1 million each for two consecutive quarters now, our highest level since we transformed into a pure-play hospitality software solutions technology provider in fiscal 2014. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 also marked our second consecutive quarter of positive adjusted earnings from operations, the only two such positive quarters since before fiscal 2014. This is a goal we set out to achieve from the early days of my joining Agilysys in January 2017. We're pleased to see our efforts to improve profitability, for which adjusted earnings from operation or AOE is the metric we focus on, are beginning to show results. AOE for Q1 fiscal 2019 was about a $3.7 million improvement over Q1 of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, AOE is essentially adjusted EBITDA minus capital spend, or stated differently, a measure of our overall revenue minus overall expenses, whether they're capitalized or not, minus capital expenditure and is a comprehensive measure of our business operations performance. Aside from certain exceptional one-time cash expenditures, such as payments for restructuring or legal settlements, AOE is also a good proxy of free cash flow over a full fiscal year period. While on the subject of capital expenditure, please note that Q1 fiscal 2019 will be the last quarter where we have capitalized a portion of our R&D efforts. Our approach to product development has changed substantially in the recent past. Our product development strategies are a lot more agile now in the true sense of that term. We have dramatically reduced the time lapse between design of a module and its deployment in the field. This has negated any significant need to capitalize our R&D cost going forward. Barring any special exceptions, we don't expect to capitalize any significant portion of our R&D cost going forward. This will make comparisons with the past difficult with respect to adjusted EBITDA, GAAP profitability metrics and our product development expense on our P&L as R&D costs included in the future calculations will not have the benefit of any capitalization-related exclusions. Our various cost categories measured as a percentage of revenue have remained steady to lower over the past few quarters even as we continue to invest where we need to facilitate growth. This is especially true in R&D. Our R&D costs as a percentage of revenue have remained steady even as we have doubled our R&D capacity during the past year. Our India Development Center now has about has 310 personnel employed directly with us, all brought onboard with as strict as possible recruitment practices. We are at near full capacity in the India Development Center now. Our IDC personnel continue to improve exponentially with every passing month with respect to their product expertise and contributions. The doubling of R&D capacity during the past year has helped us increase product development and innovation velocity by leaps and bounds. A few examples of the progress we have made with our products during the recent past would include: One, about 10 months ago, towards the end of calendar 2017, a few customers suggested to us to develop our own online booking engine that integrate seamlessly with our property management system products. We completed development of rGuest Book, the online booking engine, in a matter of months and one of our customers actually implemented this module in production and took their first live reservation over 2 months ago. There are multiple other customers going live on this module soon. Such software-based modules, obviously, contribute well to both our top line revenue and bottom line profitability growth. We have now greatly reduced the cost and the time it takes for us to take such software modules from design to development to sale to implementation. Two, we have recently launched rGuest Express, a new guest self-service kiosk solution for hotels. Both rGuest Book and rGuest Express will be tightly integrated with all our property management system products. Example number 3, a new version of LMS, the property management system that many major hotels currently use, was released recently. This new version contains several new enhancements, including a modern web-based user interface. Example 4, additional mobile capabilities have been added to both our property management system and point-of-sale products that provide key features to improve guest experience, including enabling guest to check in and check out online, features that help improve staff productivity with mobile housekeeping and tablet-based solutions for use in various remote areas within a resort. Five, we recently released a new significantly enhanced version of our flagship InfoGenesis POS product. This new version includes an all new look and feel to the POS terminal application, providing more modern user interface themes with enhanced style and branding opportunities for our customers. This version also employs the latest Microsoft technology features, allowing customers to create more meaningful guest experiences. In addition, we introduced a robust fiscal integration network -- integration framework that will enable a wider global reach for the product. We are continuing to see benefits from increased sell-through and customer adoption of our two point-of-sale products, InfoGenesis, which provides SaaS-oriented POS functions and reporting and rGuest Buy, our guest-facing kiosk POS solution. These two products complement each other well. Together, they provide a market-leading comprehensive POS solution. InfoGenesis continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace through its strong reporting and analysis features, enterprise-grade menu and item configuration capabilities as well as multi-language support. rGuest Buy, which leverages InfoGenesis’ robust transaction engine is already installed in over 100 locations and continues to open up near and long-term sales opportunities for us. Recently, rGuest Buy made its entry into the casino gaming market with a couple of recent casino openings featuring the product to provide self-service capability to their guests. Customers are also increasingly valuing rGuest Pay's complete and secure payment gateway services. rGuest Pay provides access to validated point-to-point encryption, includes a payment information proxy that secures data arriving via e-commerce interfaces and a full range of fixed and mobile EMV-ready payment devices, which facilitate compliance with payment card security regulations. rGuest Stay, the property management system product built ground up to be a cloud SaaS-based cutting edge technology solution is beginning to see increased acceptance in limited services hotels. We continue to increase the speed at which we are adding various functionality features to this product to address the needs of middle market and full-service hotels. rGuest Stay is currently live in over 100 properties. With Don DeMarinis and Heather Foster, both of whom joined us earlier this calendar year, with Don and Heather leading the charge, our go-to-market strategy definition and execution continues to improve. Good product development and innovation momentum backed with greatly improved sales and marketing processes have resulted in increased sales momentum. We are also encouraged by our Q1 results across several operational metrics, including another quarter of net positive competitive replacements, increase in sales of additional products to existing customers, growth in sales with large strategic accounts and some initial success in developing our international sales efforts. All of which will help drive revenue growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Regarding our international efforts, we recently initiated a search for a new head of Asia and have identified several good candidates who are keen to join us. We expect to fill this position during the next couple of months. Our Q1 results included many new customer wins, including the Ellis Island Hotel, Casino & Brewery in Las Vegas, who chose InfoGenesis and rGuest Pay. Silver Reef Casino, Hotel and Spa in Ferndale, Washington, who chose Visual One, InfoGenesis and Eatec. The Rosewood Mayakoba Resort in Mexico, who chose a suite of Agilysys solutions to replace a competitor set of products. And Hotel Interurban in Seattle, who selected Visual One and rGuest Pay. Our management team is settled and working well now. Collectively, we are driving positive culture and work ethic changes, which are beginning to show in our results. We are now dramatically more passionate with our customer centricity. We are a lot more engineering and innovation driven. We also care a lot more seriously about supporting all the markets we play in. In summary, we are off to a solid start in fiscal 2019. We remain confident in our strategy and direction. We're beginning to see good early results from our transformation process. We have unique and industry-leading product offerings that we continue to enhance and expand so that we can evolve successfully along with our customer demands. We're now finding a good rhythm working internally as a unified and cohesive team across all organizational areas and all geographies. And most important of all, we are winning back the trust of our customers. As stated in our earnings call last quarter, we continue to expect to achieve approximately 10% full year top line revenue growth in fiscal 2019, compared to the fiscal 2018 revenue level of approximately 127 million. In addition, we continue to expect our improving operational efficiencies will help us improve our full year adjusted earnings from operations by around 6 million for the full year fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018 where our AOE loss was approximately 6 million, meaning we expect to be close to at or slightly above breakeven adjusted earnings from operations for full fiscal 2019. Due to the negative working capital cash flow fluctuation that is typical of the first half of every fiscal year, our cash balance went down by close to 5 million in Q1 as forecasted. We expect a similar slightly lesser decrease in cash balance in Q2 as well. We expect Q3 and Q4 of this fiscal year to be positive cash flow quarters for us, bringing our cash balance back to the current level or higher at the end of fiscal 2019. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Tony Pritchett, to provide more color on our financial results. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh. Our fiscal 2019 start provides evidence of the significant progress we are achieving across many key financial priorities, including lowering our overall cost as a percentage of revenue, growing our recurring revenue base and positioning the company for further growth. Our overall revenue grew by $0.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to $34 million compared to $33.9 million in the prior year period, marking our highest revenue since we transformed our business into a pure-play hospitality software solutions technology provider in fiscal 2014. First quarter revenue also marked the third consecutive sequential rise in overall revenue, growing from $32.1 million in Q4 of fiscal 2018. Importantly, as we mentioned in our earnings release, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had a very minimal impact on our overall revenue. Under the old revenue recognition method, our current quarter revenue would have been about $50,000 higher. Please note that in accordance with the modified retrospective method of adopting the new revenue recognition standards, our March 31 balance sheet has not been restated to reflect the new guidance. Therefore, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other noncurrent assets, contract assets and contract liability are not directly comparable on the basis of the balance sheet. Please refer to the full disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financials in our 10-Q, which will be filed later this week for more disclosure to help the comparison. Moving to installed endpoints, by the end of Q1, we serviced about 264,000 rooms in approximately 48,000 terminal endpoints, or a 6% and 18% increase, respectively compared to Q1 of last year. And total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 8% of total fiscal 2019 first quarter revenue. Product revenue decreased 11.7% to $9.1 million on the back of significant hardware shipments in the same period last year. However, when compared to the average product revenue for the trailing four quarters of $8.4 million and the prior quarter's product revenue of $7.9 million, the results for fiscal 2019 Q1 reflect growth of 8% and 14%, respectively. Looking at the support maintenance and subscription services line item, our recurring revenue rose 7.6% to $17.9 million compared to the prior year period. Keep in mind that our fiscal 2019 first quarter revenue for this line item was reduced with the adoption of the new revenue standards compared to prior quarters as presented by about $250,000, meaning using comparable numbers, the growth will be even stronger. We are pleased that the recurring revenue increase included a 19% increase in SaaS-based subscription revenue. Recurring revenue now represents 53% of total revenue with SaaS-based subscription revenue representing approximately 32% of recurring revenues, marking steady growth compared to 29% in Q1 of last year. Professional services revenue was up 1.2% to $7 million compared to the prior year period even with the $170,000 headwind from the adoption of the new revenue rules. Going forward, we expect sales momentum to continue in fiscal '19 leading the top line revenue growth, while SaaS revenue will continue to outpace the rate of total recurring revenue growth. While the overall fiscal 2019 first quarter revenue was only slightly up compared to fiscal 2018 first quarter, we continue to achieve a much higher quality revenue mix that provided us with higher margins given the added contribution from SaaS subscription and other recurring revenue. Recurring revenue grew by $1.2 million and recurring margin grew by $1.2 million, reflecting the scalable nature of our infrastructure to host and support our customer installed base going forward. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold decreased by 6.3% or $1.1 million in the first quarter to $16.1 million versus the prior year period, mainly as a result of a lower mix of third-party products and the success we've had with the realignment of our professional services team to support more revenue on a lower cost basis. This overall decrease in cost of goods sold on our slight increase in revenue, including lower professional services costs on similar revenue and flat recurring revenue costs on meaningful revenue growth reflects the success we are having with our cost initiatives. The revenue mix and reduction in cost of goods sold led to improvement in gross profit margin, which rose nearly 340 basis points to 52.6% from 49.2% in the prior year period. Taking a closer look, products' gross profit decreased $0.7 million with gross profit margin decreasing to 21.5%, primarily as a result of lower sales and higher amortization of developed technology. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $1.2 million, leading to a total gross margin of 77.3% compared to 75.8% in Q1 of fiscal 2018, reflecting a positive impact of the operational changes we have implemented. Professional services gross profit increased by $0.7 million with gross profit margin increasing to 29.8% compared to 19.9% in Q1 of fiscal 2018. Looking at operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges, the first quarter saw a 3.3% decrease in operating expenses to $19 million compared to $19.7 million in the prior year period. Product development expenses increased by $0.5 million or 7% compared to fiscal Q1 of last year, while doubling the size of our R&D teams over the same period of time. However, we did realize the benefit of about $500,000 related to stock compensation expense reversals in Q1 of fiscal 2019. Also, as Ramesh pointed out, we will no longer be capitalizing software development costs. As some of you may remember, these costs largely reflect the investments made in our rGuest platform over the past few years. Starting with the fiscal second quarter, we will report these costs in our income statement as part of development expense rather than in our cash flow statement and balance sheet as capitalized software development cost. The change in accounting treatment is dictated by our newly implemented development practices being much more nimble and faster to bring products to market. We expect this change hitting the P&L, along with normalized stock comp expense level starting next quarter and a full quarter of the IDC being fully ramped, we'll increase product development expense by around $3 million. However, when you see this increase, remember that our total spend on product development, including OpEx and CapEx will be comparable to recent quarters as a percentage of revenue, still lower than Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '17 when we began the effort to double our R&D strength. Starting next quarter, when this begins to impact our GAAP P&L, we will provide disclosure to help reconcile quarterly expense trends. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.4 million or 7.3% compared to fiscal Q1 of last year, while general and administrative expenses decreased $0.8 million or 11.7% compared to fiscal Q1 of last year as we continue to focus on more efficient and cost-effective ways to operate. As was the case in the prior quarter, our overall expense level as a percentage of revenue was lower in Q1 fiscal 2019, compared to the same period last year, and our expectation remains that we will grow revenue at a faster rate than cost increases as we leverage the operating scale of the business. Our operating loss of $1.6 million for the first quarter favorably compares to an operating loss of $3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This led to a net loss of $1.7 million for the first quarter, also favorably comparing to a net loss of $3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA was a gain of approximately $3.1 million in the first quarter, almost double the $1.6 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As Ramesh highlighted, we achieved our second quarter -- our second consecutive quarter of positive AOE as this metric rose more than $3.7 million year-over-year. Ongoing improvement in AOE clearly demonstrates that the various strategic initiatives we have been working on for the past year or so are positioning Agilysys well for sustainable and consistent profitable growth. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2018, was $35.1 million compared to $39.9 million at March 31, 2018. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $2.9 million in expense for our ongoing product development investment and investments in our internal assets as well as a normal cash outlflow from operations that we experienced in the first fiscal quarter due to the timing of when we bill and collect annual maintenance and pay bonuses. And in terms of our NOLs, we continue to carry approximately $200 million of NOL carryforwards with a full valuation allowance on our book that will help us remain liable for taxes paid only in certain foreign jurisdictions, along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our current NOLs expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2038. As a reminder, the tax law in place stipulates that all preexisting NOLs prior to our fiscal 2019 can be utilized at 100% and are not subject to the 80% limit that any future created NOLs will be subject to. Going forward, we expect cash to come down some from our current balance before rising again to end fiscal 2019 at $35 million to $37 million, a decline of approximately $3 million to $5 million from the fiscal 2018 year-end balance of $39.9 million. This will mark a meaningful improvement from the over $9 million decline in fiscal 2018 and much higher rate of cash burn in years prior to that, providing us with healthy financial flexibility to achieve our near and long-term goals. Regarding guidance, we have reiterated our previously provided forecast for fiscal 2019 full year revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to $127 million in revenue during fiscal 2018, and we expect to realize an improvement of about $6 million in adjusted earnings from operations in fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018. In closing, we are pleased with the solid start to the year and with the progress to meeting our 2019 and beyond financial goals as we increase the visibility and sustainability of our sales momentum and remain on track to achieve our guidance for full year revenue growth of approximately 10% and significant profitability gains. I would now like to open the call to questions. Jonathan?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee from Maxim Group.
Allen Klee: Question of the change in R&D that the amortization will stop and then this will go into product development expense. How -- what did you say in terms of the -- what the impact will be of that? Were you talking about for a full year or for quarters? When you -- could you maybe just walk through that a little bit?
Tony Pritchett: Yes. Allen, so just to clarify, the amortization won't stop. What's going to stop is the capitalization of certain R&D costs. If you look at our current P&L, you'll see that there is capitalized software development costs -- I'm sorry, not the P&L but the cash flow statement, there's capitalized software development cost. Those costs in future quarters won't show up on the cash flow statement like that. They'll actually be included in the P&L in product development expenses. So our expectation if you look at Q2 of this fiscal year, so next quarter, our expectation is that product development expense will grow up by about $3 million compared to Q1, and that should be the ongoing -- roughly the ongoing rate of product development expenses for the next few quarters. But keep in mind that increase in product development expenses really is not comparable to prior quarters. You have to incorporate that capitalized software development costs along with product development expense from the P&L in order to get a full view of product development expense.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Okay. But one thing, Allen -- thank you. One thing to keep in mind, this doesn't mean that our R&D expenses is going up, right? In reality, that's not going up, but part of what we spend in R&D today gets capitalized, gets removed out of the GAAP P&L and goes into the balance sheet and that practice stops. We won't be capitalizing any of our R&D costs anymore. But in terms of what we are really spending in R&D, that doesn't change. If anything, it will only go down with time as a percentage of revenue.
Allen Klee: Okay. How would you -- in terms of the growth coming from your different vertical end markets, would -- is there any way you would kind of rank it in terms of the casinos, the hotels, foodservice. How would we think about that?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, Allen. I mean, I don't know about ranking it because our growth opportunities are pretty high in each of those. So let's look at it in two ways, Allen. One from a product segmentation perspective. For the next, say, 9 to 12 months, a significant portion of our growth comes from our point of sale products, meaning InfoGenesis and rGuest Buy. InfoGenesis is more of the staff-facing functionality product, and rGuest Buy is more of the guest-facing kiosk-related product. Those two products together will be a majority of our growth for the next 9 months or so, and we expect PMS to really become a major product -- property management systems to be a major driver of growth in -- starting FY '20 and beyond. So that's from a product standpoint. So there if you have to rank it, I would rank point-of-sale first and property management system second. If you move to our market segments, in terms of how you rank, gaming is doing very well for us, right? Gaming, that business continues to grow for us. But I would guess a major portion of our growth would come from HRC, hotel, resource, cruises and also foodservice management, where the business is really beginning to come back to us. And I expect a major portion of our growth to come from Asia and EMEA as well because our market share is extremely low in those regions. And services -- technical and professional services will also be a significant contributor to our growth.
Allen Klee: Okay. And what percent -- or how -- what was your international for the quarter and how did that grow year-over-year?
Tony Pritchett: Allen, international remains in the high single-digits as a percentage of revenue, not a lot of change in the first quarter compared to the prior year results. We're seeing some significant opportunity there, we're getting some momentum there. But as far as growth in the first quarter, it wasn't a whole lot different than the prior year.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then with the rGuest Stay and with the larger hotel chains, it's been a long term -- a lot of time working on these products. And I know you just said fiscal 2020 where you think more traction, but to what degree do you have higher confidence now of the products coming out and the reception?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. What used to be long term, Allen, is now short term. So now we are talking in terms of months and quarters. So I do understand what you are saying, that rGuest Stay has been in the development phase for multiple years now. But now since we've added a lot more R&D capacity without increasing the cost too much, things are happening much quicker in Stay. The last quarter, we saw a lot more opportunities for Stay come to us than probably 3, 4 quarters before that combined. So Stay is really beginning to pick up steam, and FY '20 is only like 2, 3 quarters away for us. So it is in the short term, it is a matter of months and quarters now before Stay really starts pulling our growth engine forward.
Allen Klee: Okay. And any comments just on the sales pipeline today? And how that -- maybe that compares to how it's been over the last couple of quarters?
Ramesh Srinivasan: The pipeline is looking healthier now, Allen. The large hotel chain opportunities that were captured, say, about a year or two ago, the pipeline from those large hotel chains is a lot more significant than it was before. Our pipeline from international and Asia regions have definitely increased. We are working on several significant size deals now and those significant size deals are more in number now than it used to be in the past. And with our products getting better now, we've added a number of new products just in the last -- just since the last quarter, like couple of quarters ago, we didn't have rGuest Book, we did have the rGuest Express kiosk, we didn't have our new product, rGuest Service, the guest tablet ordering, lot more simplified mobile ordering. We didn't have all those software modules with us. So those software modules are driving their own sets of opportunities that we didn't have before. So we have a lot more software module selling opportunities now than we have before. And probably more than anything else, our traction with rGuest Buy has really picked up in the last couple of quarters. So I would say, our pipeline is more than it was in the previous quarters. It is a lot more broad-based. It comes from multiple vertical segments, and it is also more broad-based in terms of the number of software modules that we have in our bag now to sell. So our pipeline is looking a lot healthier than it used to before.
Allen Klee: Okay, great. And then, you said that the SaaS revenue is expected to grow faster than overall revenue. Is there a way that we can think of the relative margins of the SaaS relative to the company overall? Or perhaps, like an incremental margin? Or how should we think about that?
Tony Pritchett: Allen, the SaaS margins are definitely good margins and incremental SaaS revenue comes without much incremental costs. So that's the way to think about it. I mean, as you can see in our results, our recurring revenue in total increased by about the same amount as our recurring margin increase. So that's the way to think about that. I mean, there's going to be some incremental cost, as we expand internationally, there's potential incremental cost that could come in. But there's significant scalability in all of our recurring revenue, and that applies to SaaS as well.
Ramesh Srinivasan: So one comment I would like to add, Allen. As you break that down, well more than 50%, like 53%, 54% of our revenue now is recurring revenue. And all recurring revenue is very good margin for us. What we said was, recurring revenue will continue to grow but SaaS within recurring revenue will grow faster than the non-SaaS part of recurring revenue, right? So SaaS, we'll continue to grow at a much faster pace, and all recurring revenue is very good margin for us. Now when you look at services revenue behind that, which is about 20% of our revenue, and if you see our P&L, you will see our services margins have also increased compared to last year Q1. So that aspect of our business is also producing much better margins for us now.
Allen Klee: Okay. My last question is more just a minor thing. But on the balance sheet, you have an item called contract assets, which I hadn't seen before. I don't know if you redefined something. Could you just explain what that is?
Tony Pritchett: So Allen, that is essentially unbilled revenue. That has always been in our balance sheet, and previously, it was included in accounts receivable. So I mentioned that in my remarks that the June 30 balance sheet isn't directly comparable to the March 31 balance sheet. That's just the way that the new accounting guidance was implemented. But essentially, contract assets in the balance sheet is unbilled revenue. We've always had it, and if you look in the 10-Q that comes out later this week, there'll be a lot more disclosure around that.
Ramesh Srinivasan: That's related to the 606.
Tony Pritchett: Yes, related to the new revenue recognition standard.
Allen Klee: But it's not deferred revenue?
Tony Pritchett: No. If you look on the balance sheet, there is a line item called contract liabilities. That is the old deferred revenue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Phil Bernard from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.
Phil Bernard: First question. With respect to the new products that you mentioned, rGuest Express, rGuest Service, the new LMS version, are all of those available as we speak right now?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. The quick answer to your question is yes, Phil. But in terms of them getting integrated with each of our property management system products, they are happening one by one. So most of these products were demoed in the HITEC show, which was, what it is, a month or 2 ago. And so yes, they are all available. They're being actively sold by our sales team. The integration efforts with all our other products, they continue to make progress with every passing week, right? But the quick answer to your question is yes, these are all products that we are selling actively now.
Phil Bernard: Okay. And so you mentioned, let's see, specifically the rGuest Book, there is a trial that started 2 months ago. How long does it generally take for one of these to be ready for general availability for all of your clients?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, that was not a trial, Phil. That customer is actually using it in production and that -- it's the first install, right? So it is not a trial install, it's the first install. And it is working very well for them. It has actually helped them sell certain kinds of rooms. They have certain 5-bedroom villas that they were not selling great before. Now those sales have really picked up because with our booking engine, you can actually show pictures of the place. And so that is really helping them out. So they are making good progress in terms of using the product, and they are taking reservations in it, and they are doing very well with it. So they are live and in production. And what we are working on the product now is the Phase 2 of enhancements and also making sure it's integrated with all our PMS products. So that product is being sold actively to other customers as well.
Phil Bernard: Let's see. The professional services gross margin this quarter had a pretty good bump. Curious -- and I know you guys mentioned that the team has been retooled somewhat to be -- to more efficiently serve your customers. Is this the new kind of run rate? Or was this an anomaly?
Tony Pritchett: No. This -- Phil, this is Tony. This isn't an anomaly. This is a level that you should see going forward. I mean, this has kind of been our target over the past year, we've been working and the professional services margin is up. So this is -- this Q1 is not an anomaly.
Ramesh Srinivasan: So if you compare Q1 of last year with Q1 of this year, when you look at the P&L, you will see that the services revenue is around the 6.9 million range for both those quarters. The 6.9 million or close to $7 million this quarter was achieved at -- on a much less cost basis than last year's Q1. And you should expect that to continue.
Phil Bernard: Okay. That's good to know. And that will actually --- oh, actually one more question on the new sales and marketing duo that you have in place. I'm curious from a high-level if you could speak to what the major differences are between the way that this current marketing team and sales is operating versus the -- any prior teams because there has been kind of quite a bit of turnover in that part of the business over the years.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, sure. So in terms of Heather Foster in marketing and Don DeMarinis in sales, let me talk about marketing first, right? Our marketing efforts are getting a lot more professional and pointed now, especially in the area of demand and pipeline generation. I cannot tell you that we did a great job of demand generation before and now the turnover in marketing is sort of a positive turnover. And Heather and the professionals we are getting in place in marketing are more demand-generation experts, right? So that is one area we could have done a lot better in. So our demand generation efforts are a lot more metric driven, lot more pointed and a lot more professional now. That's a big improvement in marketing. And also if you have been to HITEC, you would have seen that the look and feel of our booth is a lot more modern, lot more high-tech, which is what our products deserve. And if you come to G2E, you will see that our booth has tripled in size and has a lot more modern high-tech look now. That's on the marketing side. Now on the sales side, I know far bigger changes there with Don, who has worked at MICROS for many years when that company grew from kind of our size to $1 billion revenue company, our sales process is a lot more disciplined and granular now. There's a lot more accountability in sales forecasting, right? We take our sales forecasting a lot more serious, it's granular, it is monitored on a weekly basis, and there is more accountability there, right? When people make forecasts, we are supposed to meet those forecasts. So Don is a lot more disciplined in those areas. And Don along with the Sales Directors working with him have realigned sales territories. And probably the most important thing in sales is a culture change in our company that all of us work for sales. Not just the people in the sales department but everyone else, R&D, services, customer support, all of us are part of sales. So when sales needs help, all of us jump up, right? So there's much better cross-function teamwork now. And we are focusing on new customers. That's one big change that Don has brought to the place, that we are going after a lot more bigger, newer customers, especially in the foodservices management, FSM space, in that vertical, and a lot more customer touches. A lot more of our executive team is getting closer and closer to prospective end customers. So it's an entirely different, more disciplined, more granular, more accountable sales processes in place now.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Ramesh Srinivasan for any further remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: There's one more question?
Operator: We just got one -- yes, we just got one question in the queue. Our next question comes from the line of Tucker Golden from Solas Capital.
Tucker Golden: Just had a question on some of the sales drivers you've mentioned. It seems like there's a lot to be excited about. You mentioned net positive competitive replacements. Can you maybe discuss the competitive environment? Where you are seeing your products as most advantaged, maybe where they're challenged, any color there?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Tucker, thank you for joining the call. So in terms of competitive environment, it has not changed much during the last few quarters. If anything, it has become a bit more favorable to us. And the reason is, we are in a very good space now in terms of -- this business, this B2B enterprise software business requires enormous customer focus and it requires enormous flexibility. You just can't be a product company and say this is our product, take it or leave it. You can't be that way. You have to be a solutions-oriented company that remains flexible to customer needs around our products. We have to maintain our products, keep them upgradable, but we need to be very flexible, very close to customers. So that requires a very flexible sort of culture, and the team that is used to the fact that things change based on customer request. And that kind of culture is not easy to create, right? So we have very big competitors for whom that kind of flexibility is, obviously, quite difficult, it's not easy. And then we have much smaller competitors, who are -- it's not easy to scale. So there is reasonable barrier to entry into the space, right? You just can't get into a B2B space like ours and can't scale up that quickly, right? So that barrier to entry is there. And so I would say our competitive environment is quite encouraging. It is the same. If anything, it's improved a little bit in our favor. And also the fact that we have improved our product development velocity now is putting that in a -- putting us in a much better competitive situation now. So I like our positioning now. I think it really will facilitate future growth for us.
Tucker Golden: That's great. And in terms of the large strategic accounts, I know you already provided some color on the call. Any anecdotes or specific color you can give us on a case study or maybe an account where you've made progress and where you see significant opportunity?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, we don't want to name customers, Tucker. But there is one major strategic customer in the hotel, resorts, cruise space that we did sign about 1.5, 2 years ago and across the literally hundreds of hotels that they have, that is providing us good fuel for growth as we go through those hotels one by one and replacing competitive products in those hotels. And like I told you, in the FSM space now, we are focused on a couple of bigger size customers with whom we did not do any business before. So we are adding to the bigger customers, bigger strategic customers, in terms of numbers. And the strategic customers we already had, the bigger ones, we are increasing our business breadth with them.
Tucker Golden: That's great. And then this last one likely for Tony. In terms of the gross margins, if we just want to compare year-over-year, I understand there's lower product mix and then I know the timing of product rollout can impact cost of goods as well. Can you just kind of bridge the increase because they were up pretty significantly, over 300 basis points? Can you just discuss sort of what's going on within gross margin?
Tony Pritchett: Yes, the main impact on gross margin is the improvement in the professional services gross margin that we mentioned as well as the increase in recurring revenue that came with very little incremental cost. That's offset a little bit with some incremental amortization that's coming in to the product cost of goods sold line. But in effect, the increase in gross margins is due to the recurring revenue and the professional services cost improvements that we made. Does that answer the question?
Tucker Golden: That's great. So the amortization was actually not favorable. This is really more operating leverage. Great.
Tony Pritchett: The amortization is unfavorable, absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Ramesh Srinivasan for any further remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Jonathan. We started off fiscal 2019 with growing momentum, driven by recurring revenue, healthy margins and balance sheet, a world-class leadership team, a fully functional India Development Center and an entirely new attitude across the organization, focused on being customer centric and engineering driven, devoted to all the markets we serve. If you're planning to be at G2E at the G2E show in Las Vegas in early October, please let us know, and we'll be happy to meet you there and also provide product demonstrations, especially of the newer software modules we have going now. We'll have a much larger presence at the show this year, which will highlight our improving and growing product portfolio. I also look forward to reporting on the additional progress we are achieving in the business when we announce our second quarter results later this fall. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, you may now disconnect. Good day.";[0.013521776715716971, -0.011487229067061455];-0.011487229067061455;0.013521776715716971;1

Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Norberto. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2019 second quarter results. Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. Taking a look at our financial results revenue was a quarterly record $34.2 million or an increase of 4 million compared to fiscal 2018 second quarter leading to a GAAP net loss of $3.8 million or a loss of $0.16 per share, compared to a loss of 3.2 million or $0.14 per share in Q2 of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA was 2.6 million this quarter compared to 2.3 million in the same period last year. Both adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net loss calculations for last year fiscal 2018 Q2 benefited from approximately 2.5 million of capitalized software development costs. If all software development costs were not capitalized in both periods then adjusted EBITDA this quarter would have been at $2.8 million improvement over the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA would have been positive 2.6 million for this period that is fiscal 2019 second quarter as against a loss of 0.2 million for the comparable period last year. Along the same lines the increase in GAAP product development cost in Q2 of fiscal 2019 over Q2 of fiscal 2018 is mostly due to Q2 of fiscal 2018 having the benefit of capitalized software development costs which are not applicable to Q2 of fiscal 2019. This was our second consecutive record revenue and fourth consecutive sequential revenue growth quarter. Revenue increased in all three major revenue lines. Product revenue was up 20%, recurring revenue increased 10%, highlighted by a 27% increase in SaaS based subscription recurring revenue, and professional services rose by over 15%. Recurring revenue comprised of annual maintenance and SaaS subscription services was a quarterly record 18.9 million or 55% of total net revenue compared to 17.1 million or 57% of total net revenue in Q2 of fiscal 2018. SaaS revenues increased 27% year-over-year and was a record high 34% of total recurring revenue, compared to 29% of total recurring revenue in Q2 of the prior year fiscal 2018. We remain confident in our ability to maintain and improve on our recurring revenue levels driven by growth in SaaS revenue. Adjusted earnings from operations or AOE was positive 2 million this quarter compared to a loss of 1.2 million in Q2 of fiscal 2018; as a reminder AOE is essentially adjusted EBITDA minus capitalized software spend minus CapEx. A measure of our overall revenue minus overall expenses whether we're capitalized or not minus capital expenditures. Excluding some extraordinary one-time cash expenditures such as restructuring costs or legal settlement payments AOE is also a good proxy for free cash flow over a full year fiscal period. We narrowed our cash losses during the first half of fiscal 2019 to $7 million compared to 10.7 million cash loss during the first half of fiscal 2018. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions remain healthy with close to 33 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. As a reminder due to the timing of our annual maintenance billing cycle our cash flow tends to be significantly better during the second half of the fiscal year compared to the first half. Thus we expect our cash balance to improve during each of Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2019 and end up about 35 million as of the end of the current fiscal year. As expected a majority of our current revenue growth is being driven by our industry leading POS products, InfoGenesis and rGuest Buy. We have introduced crucial mobility based modules along with other enhancements to complement our core point-of-sale POS product strength. We continue to work on enhancing our PMS products as well, including the creation of additional software modules, some of which have already been deployed on customer production flows. During the past six months we’ve added multiple new innovative software modules which work with and add value to our POS and PMS product offerings there’re about eight new software modules that have already been implemented or will be implemented during the next few months. Each of these are based on customer requests and were designed quickly and efficiently to allow our customers to implement them in the shortest possible timeframe. Such increased development and deployment speed will continue to help us gain traction with both current and new customers. We expect our property management system product line to contribute to our revenue growth with increasing effectiveness going forward. In the recent past, we’ve made considerable progress with our leading edge cloud SaaS based rGuest Stay property management system both in terms of product enhancements and sales deals closed. rGuest Stay is currently live in more than 130 properties across more than 20,000 rooms. Given the rapid progress we’re making with this product we expect rGuest Stay to be an increasingly important growth driver for us. Our property management system solutions currently support 270,000 rooms, which is a small fraction of the overall market price. As an added perspective our largest competitors reported to support about 5 million rooms. Increased product development and innovation velocity have clearly been the main driver of our revenue growth during the recent past. We plan to continue driving home that competitive advantage with sensible carefully managed increases in R&D investment. Our US based R&D teams have led and collaborated with the currently 320 person strong India development centers in an exemplary manner. We have made significant progress with our well established products like InfoGenesis, LMS and B1, and our rGuest solutions have made considerable progress as well during the recent past. Customers have noticed the improved velocity of product improvements and new innovative modules creation and that has resulted in improved sales and revenue levels. Given that success and with the opportunity in front of us to build on our current business momentum our board recently approved an initiative to increase our US-based R&D services and customer support engineering resources along with doubling our India development central capacity from the current 330 to approximately 660 by the end of calendar 2019. While our goal remains to grow revenue significantly faster than cost that can be seen by our six months fiscal 2019 versus 2018 AOE improvements of more than 6 million on a revenue increase of about 4 million. Our goal remains to ultimately get our R&D cost to under 20% of overall revenue. While we expect 1 to 3 percentage point increase in R&D as a percentage of revenue over the next four to five quarters, that ratio will start moving down as revenue increases and should settle down at a run rate of less than 20% of overall revenue. Despite remaining very disciplined while managing our cost we are also keen on investing in the right areas at the right time to support our market position and growth. Our recent focus on world class customer service and support and on delivering product enhancements, new products and innovative solutions to real customer demands has been driving our recent revenue growth. This increased investment in expanding and strengthening our software engineering talent should further those gains. As we have highlighted in the past one of our major revenue growth opportunities lies in cross selling to our current extensive customer base. With a broader product offering we are in a good position to take advantage of this opportunity. About 12 months ago approximately 50% of our customers were using only one of our products. That percentage has been reduced to 42% now and we are confident it can continue to improve. This quarter was one of our best ever quarters in terms of new business sales wins. During this quarter we added 24 new customers of which 15 were SaaS. We also expanded partnerships with more than 60 current customers through more than 100 new sites and over 50 new product purchases for current sites. Altogether new business made up of three categories, one new logos, two new sites sold to current customers and three new product sales to current customer sites. All taken together this was one of our best ever quarters for new business sales. We continue to see multiple areas of opportunities to expand our business with large strategic customers, across all our market segments. We continue to expand our business and partnership with Hilton Properties across the world. Since we were named as one of Hilton’s approved hospitality solutions vendors about two years ago many Hilton properties all over the world have switched their POS system to InfoGenesis. Over the past few months alone we’ve closed more than 20 engagements with various additional Hilton properties in the US, Europe, and Asia. And we’re currently in the early stages of initial implementations with at least a couple other large customers across the hotels, resorts, cruises and foodservice management market segments. With respect to food services management we continue to make good headway led by our InfoGenesis and rGuest Buy products. Multiple major operators in this segment are in the process of expanding their business partnership with us. Our gaming casino hospitality related business continues to do exceptionally well. Growth in non-gaming continue to outpace growth in gaming revenue in various major casinos across the country that also means our casino customers will spend relatively more on enhancing the non-gaming areas of their resorts which obviously bodes well for hospitality technology solution providers like us. Our overall sales levels in the gaming casino segment during the past six months were our best first half of the fiscal year start ever. Earlier this month we attended the Global Gaming Expo, G2E show in Las Vegas where we made a good splash with triple the booth space we had last year in order to showcase the increased core product enhancements available along with our new innovative software modules. We enjoyed a significant increase in customer meetings and the number of actionable leads generated during the show was twice as much as in 2016 and about 60% greater than last year. International expansion in EMEA and APAC remains a major revenue growth focus for us, we continue to work on several initiatives including required product enhancements to accelerate our growth in these regions. The past year has been one of our best periods in terms of sales from APAC and EMEA and we’re only getting started as our market share in both those regions is nowhere close to where we’re capable of achieving. Rod Talbot an experienced application software executive who is an expert in selling technology solutions in virtually all major countries in Asia joined us earlier this month as our APAC Managing Director. We’ve also made good strides in our marketing efforts and overall company messaging. We’re now a lot more consistent and focused with our positioning and messaging. Our lead and demand generation activities are currently in the process of getting kicked into a higher gear. A couple of quick comments regarding the current environment and the market we serve. The hospitality industry is now well poised and at an inflection point having outperformed many other sectors and the overall economy. We are lucky to be operating in a healthy and growing market where there is an important and strategic need for better technology solutions that empower and enable property operators to compete more effectively and efficiently for their guests' loyalty. Our customers are facing increasing demand from their guests, who in turn are getting more and more familiar with greater conveniences in various aspects of their lives most of them driven by technological advances. Face with such demand from their guests our customers are looking more and more to partners like Agilysys to help them meet those guest demands. Be it across casinos, hotels, cruise ships or food and beverage outlets our customers are laser focused on improving guest experience and loyalty level. This constitutes the major opportunity for us and for the other technology vendors in this business. We are in an environment where our growth depends almost entirely on our speed of innovation and remains largely insulated from the various uncertainties many other industries are currently facing. As a leading provider of both cloud SaaS based and on prem solutions across all our product lines and as a provider entirely focused on hospitality with an increasingly cost-effective and powerful R&D engine powering us forward, we are uniquely positioned to be the most trusted and innovative partner for our customers. These industries and markets we serve are hungry for the world class technology providers and we are well on our way towards being the one. Our sales and marketing teams are reenergized with the support they are getting for their business development initiatives from the various product finance services and support teams and this is leading to much improved sales productivity and a positive change towards the more driven and passionate culture. In conclusion we are increased by our results so far when we think about our ability to grow the business and drive shareholder value. We are beginning to see positive results from our transformation process. We are very conscious that we have a lot of improvement yet to get done and a lot more opportunities to address in front of us. We will remain disciplined with our growth plans. If there is anything the recent past has shown us disciplined and profitable growth is clearly possible for us. We look forward to reporting on another record revenue quarter late January 2019. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO Tony Pritchett to provide added perspective on our financial results and maybe other aspects of our business. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thank you Ramesh. Our fiscal 2019 second quarter results highlight our continued progress and provide further proof that our initiatives are yielding success across many key financial metrics, including double digit topline growth, lowering our overall cost as a percentage of revenue turning into a cash generating company and positioning the company for further growth. All while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and operating the company in a prudent and disciplined fashion. Starting with our topline overall revenue grew by 13.5% or $4.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to $34.2 million compared to $30.1 million in the prior year period marking our highest quarterly revenue since we transformed our business into a pure play hospitality technology provider in fiscal 2014. Second quarter revenue also marked the fourth consecutive sequential rise in overall revenue growing from $30.1 million in Q2 of fiscal 2018. Importantly, we were able to achieve this while maintaining a disciplined and focused approach to cost and have continued to achieve a much higher quality revenue mix that provides us with higher margins given a strong contribution from SaaS subscriptions and other recurring revenue. Before I discuss our results in more detail I want to point out a few things to remember when reviewing our Q2 fiscal 2019 financial statements. First of all, please remember that beginning in fiscal Q2 of this year, we adopted agile development and deployment methodologies across all of our product that preclude the ability for us to capitalize internal labor costs onto the balance sheet. The fiscal second quarter of 2019 is the first quarter that you will see the results of this change in our financial statements. As a result of this change, and as discussed on our last call product development expense on the income statement is significantly higher than prior quarters, due largely to this change. The cost that was previously removed from the P&L and capitalized on to the balance sheet is now hitting expense. In Q2 of fiscal 2018 this was about $2.5 million, in the back of our earnings release, you will see a reconciliation of product development expense for Q2 of fiscal 2018 to include this $2.5 million. As an effect of this change our operating loss and net loss are also lower this quarter than they would have been if we had capitalized labor. For comparison purposes operating loss and net loss would've been around $2.5 million worse in fiscal Q2 of last year with comparable development practices. In addition, our operating cash flows on the cash flow statement now include the effect of wages and contract labor costs that was previously capitalized, whereas previous quarters reflected this expenditure as an investing activity. Free cash flow defined as cash used in operating activities plus cash used for capital expenditures and cash used for capitalized software development costs is a better cash flow metric to look at for us. Free cash flow for the six months ended September 30, 2018 is a first half record for us, free cash outflows of $6.3 million in the first half of this year compared to $10.2 million in the first half of last year a nearly $4 million improvement over a half year period. Finally, please note that in accordance with the modified retrospective method of adopting the new revenue recognition standards, which we adopted beginning with Q1 of fiscal 2019 our March 31st balance sheet has not been restated to reflect the accounting standard. Therefore accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other noncurrent assets, contract assets and contract liabilities are not directly comparable on the face of the balance sheet. Please refer to the full disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financials in our 10-Q which will be filed later this week for more disclosure to help the comparison. Getting back to my normal commentary product revenue increased 19.8% to $8.8 million compared to $7.3 million in the prior year period as a result of higher hardware sales on the back of one of our best new business bookings quarters. Professional services revenue was up 15.3% to $6.6 million compared to $5.7 million in the prior year period due to growth in our customer base including installations of our traditional on premise and subscription-based software solutions, and increased use of our technical services team for customer specific software development projects. Looking at the support maintenance and subscription services line item, our recurring revenue rose 10.2% to a quarterly record $18.9 million compared to $17.1 million in the prior year period. We are pleased with our continued growth across our recurring revenue, particularly 27% increase in SaaS based subscription revenue, which was a little ahead of the expectation we previously stated of approximately 20% year-over-year growth for this metric. Going forward, we continue to think the 20% year-over-year growth expectation is the right way to think about the progress we will make in growing SaaS revenue this year. Recurring revenue now represents over 55% of total revenue with SaaS-based subscription revenue representing approximately 34% of recurring revenues, marking steady growth compared to 29% in Q2 of last year. Going forward, we expect sales momentum to continue in the second half of fiscal 2019, resulting in topline revenue growth while SaaS revenue growth will continue to outpace the rate of total recurring revenue growth. Regarding installed endpoints, by the end of Q2 we serviced about 270,000 rooms and approximately 51,000 terminal endpoints or an 8% and 21% increase respectively, compared to Q2 of last year. And total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised of approximately 9% of total fiscal 2019 second quarter revenue. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold increased by 11.5% or $1.7 million in the second quarter to $16.5 million versus $14.8 million in the prior year period, mainly as a result of higher hardware revenue and the associated third party costs along with amortization of developed technology, which increased by almost $1 million compared to last Q2. This led to a gross profit margin of 51.9% or 90 basis points higher than the prior year period. Products gross profit decreased $0.8 million with gross profit margin decreasing to 12%, primarily as a result of the inclusion of developed technology amortization. Normalizing out developed technology would have resulted in profit margins of around 50% per product down 900 basis points from prior year due to the higher mix of hardware revenue this year. Professional services gross profit increased by $1 million with gross profit margin increasing to 27% compared to 14% in Q2 of fiscal 2018 as a result of higher revenue along with better management and utilization and billability of our professional services resources. Support maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.2 million, leading to a total gross margin of 79% compared to 74% in Q2 of fiscal 2018 reflecting the positive impact of the operational changes we have implemented allowing us to grow revenue per recurring revenue at a faster pace than growing cost. Looking at operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements and restructuring, severance and other charges the second quarter saw an 18.7% increase in operating expenses to $21.1 million compared to $17.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses is due primarily to product development expenses which increased by $3.4 million compared to fiscal Q2 of last year. As discussed we have dramatically reduced the timeline between design of the software product or feature in its deployment in the field. In Q2 this precluded capitalization of software development costs, and we expect similar outcomes going forward this change along with the growth in our number of global R&D resources led to the increase. Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.2 million or 4.4% compared to fiscal Q2 of last year while general and administrative expenses decreased to $0.4 million or 6.9% compared to fiscal Q2 of last year as we continued to make progress on implementing more efficient and cost-effective operational processes. As was the case in the prior quarter our overall expense levels, including capital expense and operating expense as a percentage of revenue was lower in Q2 fiscal 2019 compared to the same period last year and our expectation remains that we will grow revenue at a faster rate than cost increases as we leverage the operating scale of the business. Q2 of fiscal 2019, resulted in operating loss and net loss of $3.8 million for the second quarter, compared to an operating loss and net loss of $3.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2.6 million in the second quarter compared to $2.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. However, as reconciled in the back of our earnings release if all software development costs were not capitalized in both periods adjusted EBITDA would show an improvement of $2.8 million over a loss in the fiscal 2018 second quarter of 0.2 million. Adjusted earnings from operations for Q2 of fiscal 2019 was $2 million this is a metric unaffected by the capitalization changes and improved $3.2 million over last Q2. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2018 was $32.9 million compared to $39.9 million at March 31, 2018. Going forward we expect cash to increase over the second half of fiscal 2019 so that we will end the year with $35 million to $37 million of cash on hand. This will mark a meaningful improvement from the over $9 million decline in fiscal 2018 and much higher rate of cash burn in prior periods, providing us with healthy financial flexibility to achieve our near and long-term goals. And in terms of NOL we continue to carry just over $200 million of NOL carry forwards with a full valuation allowance on our books that will help us remain liable for taxes paid only on certain foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our NOLs generated prior to this fiscal year expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2038. Regarding our other guidance this afternoon we reiterated our forecast for fiscal 2019 full year revenue growth of approximately 10% over the $127 million in revenue during fiscal 2018, and we expect to realize an improvement of about $6 million in adjusted earnings from operations in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. We expect to achieve breakeven or modestly positive AOE for the full year, even as we will invest $1.5 million to $2 million to increase our US engineering strength along with doubling our India development center capacity as Ramesh discussed earlier on the call. In closing, we are pleased with the progress and momentum across our business and our ability to achieve our financial goals for fiscal 2019 by growing profitably and creating shareholder value while continuing to leverage our overall resources and keep our cost basis in line with topline growth. Our focus continues to be on generating profitable revenue growth. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us, including leveraging our increased research and development resources that will allow us to grow across both existing as well as new markets. I would now like to open the call to questions. Nicole?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: Could you just remind me I'm not sure if I caught it as for the increased spending for engineering of what you expect that to be?
Tony Pritchett: So Allen this is Tony. The increased spending in engineering isn't going to affect the R&D line as a percentage of revenue much this year. So the levels we are at now should continue for the rest of this fiscal year. We expect them to tick up a little bit maybe somewhere in the 1% to 3% range for next year. As you think about going to the next fiscal year they tick up a little bit. And then looking into the year following that we do expect R&D costs as a percentage of revenue to start coming back down. As Ramesh mentioned in his prepared remarks, 20% or less is really kind of our long-term target for that venture.
Ramesh Srinivasan: And also to just to add to that Allen, we guided to AOE adjusted earnings from operations as you know adjusted earnings from operations does get affected by capital expenses as well. So there will be about 1 million to 2 million of capital expenses plus other costs this year but in spite of that we expect to do at or slightly better on our AOE guidance this year of being breakeven.
Allen Klee: And then the additional engineering in the US and in India how do you think about the timing of how that translates into higher revenue?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Our objective remains, Allen just to reiterate our revenue will grow faster than the cost. We are obviously seeing revenue growth now. We are seeing a lot of business momentum. We see our sales increasing now. So given all that we decided that we have to keep this momentum going by improving our products at an even faster rate and also bringing newer products that customers are asking for. So we will manage the engineering increase over a period of time by carefully watching the revenue growth. So we are just giving you a heads up that we are planning to do that but we will be controlling that dial carefully depending on how our revenue continues to grow. And it will be in proportion with that.
Allen Klee: Thank you. And then do you have any view just to the seasonality where the second half relative to the first half if we should think there will be continuous sequential growth in revenue in the second half?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, the quick answer to your question Allen is yes. You should anticipate the second half being better than the first half and that is what the math points too as well, because we are retaining our guidance of 10% growth over last year. You know the last year revenue was 127 million plus, so to grow that 10% yes our second half will be better than the first half. And that is what our current momentum sales momentum everything is showing.
Allen Klee: And then any comment on just the sales pipeline overall of how you would say compares now to this time last quarter?
Ramesh Srinivasan: This time last quarter you mean this time last year, right?
Allen Klee: Yes, right, yes. Either way.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Either way, okay, our sales pipeline is at the healthiest that it has been at least as far as I have been here, so we obviously feel very positive about it which is why we’re making the decision to continue to fuel that momentum with more engineering work and supporting our customers a lot better and the pipeline comes from various different angles Allen, as the product delivery velocity and innovation velocity as we’re paying a lot more attention to customers that is definitely driving the pipeline increasing APAC, EMEA the pipeline is increasing large strategy customers we’re talking to couple three major customers across segments with whom we’ve started some initially implementations so that is feeling very positive. The casino spend shift to non-gaming is really helping and to start with our HRC market share was quite low so that is moving forward and like we’ve said selling more to our current customer base because we’ve a lot more products to sell now that is picking up. So that number used to be 50% a year ago and it was about 46% even a quarter ago and just last three months that number has come down from 46 to 42 meaning we now only have 42% of the customers who have only one product so that’s improving, there’re about four new software modules we’ve launched just in the last six months or so and there’re about five other modules that will launched in the next six months; rGuest Buy is definitely picking up traction in gaming and HRC, so in a lot of different ways Allen the pipeline now is the healthiest it has ever been and definitely better than the same time last quarter, and significantly multiple significantly better than the same time last year.
Allen Klee: Are you able to disclose how much international was as a percent of sales?
Tony Pritchett: Alan it hasn’t grown as a percentage of revenue without giving specific numbers for the quarter it’s still under 10% of our total revenue. A lot of momentum internationally we’ve seen a lot of progress there but it started from a small base.
Allen Klee: And maybe my last question would just be with the weakening of the Indian currency relative to the dollar, how should we think about how much benefit may be that gives you on the savings also?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes -- not a needle mover Allen I won’t consider that as a major needle mover but reasonable because obviously India itself is very cost effective for us and the current exchange rates do help us to a reasonable degree but not a major needle mover, so if the exchange rates strengthen the other way in the future I would not get too worried by it, it’s quite cost effective it’s working very well for us but it’s the talent level it’s the amount of innovation we’re doing, how quickly our products are improving, we’re able to add new products quicker that’s the way I would think about it. The exchange rate does give us a little bit of an advantage now but it’s nothing to be too happy about or get concerned about later.
Allen Klee: So maybe one other question I just thought could you just talk about you guys are doing some really great stuff competitively what are you seeing from your other competitors out there does it feel like you're moving ahead of them or any of them that you think that are getting more competitive or how would you comment on that?
Ramesh Srinivasan: I don’t think the competitive environment has changed too much for us Allen. I would say, I mean since the enterprise software area and hospitality is an attractive area, there is more attention to it from other competitors as well which is a good thing, I think we are operating in a good neighborhood which is always a positive thing. See we are Allen basically our advantage is we are in a good sweet spot, when you think about that 100 million to 300 million annual revenue range we are in an excellent sweet spot. And among the leading vendors we are probably one of two the only ones who are only focused on hospitality. We have very big competitors who are focused on a lot of other things as well including hospitality. And we have a lot of smaller competitors who obviously scaling up is not the easiest thing to do. So again a good sweet spot. So I still believe Allen like I told you that our faith is in our hands. If we continue to do a good job, improve the products, introduce new products, serve customers well we are in an excellent spot now and I'm happy about our competitive environment as I was a year ago.
Allen Klee: Okay, congratulations, thank you very much.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks Allen. Thank you for your time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no questions at this time. I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Ramesh Srinivasan.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Okay, thank you Nicole. In closing while we have significant work ahead of us and many areas to improve on we are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half of fiscal 2019 and with the progress we are making toward meeting our goals for the rest of this year and beyond. We remain on track to achieve our guidance for full year revenue growth of approximately 10% and significant profitability gains as well. We are confident we can continue to deliver growing revenue, healthy margins, profitability and overall improved results and performance going forward. I hope to see many of you during the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. Otherwise have a great rest of the year and we look forward to speaking with you on the fiscal third quarter call late January 2019. Thank you.

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ramesh Srinivasan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Ramesh, please go ahead.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2019 third quarter results. Joining me on this call is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. Let's get started by taking a quick look at our financial results. Q3 revenue was again a quarterly record at $36 million, a good $1.8 million ahead of the previous record number in Q2 and an increase of $4.7 million, 15% increase, that is 1-5 [ph] percent increase compared to the fiscal 2018 third quarter, leading to a GAAP net loss of $4 million or a loss of 18, 1-8 cents [ph] per share, compared to a net loss of $1.9 million or a loss of $0.08 per share in the prior year Q3 period. Last year's Q3 numbers included a onetime $1.6 million income tax benefit and a $1.8 million benefit from capitalized software development costs, which did not occur in this fiscal 2019 third quarter. This was our third consecutive quarter with record revenue and fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. This was also one of our best sales and competitive replacement quarters. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, our revenue grew by 9.4% from $95.3 million to $104.2 million, in spite of a flat first quarter. The year-over-year revenue increase this quarter was driven by a 25% increase in subscription revenue. Our overall recurring revenue rose by 12.4% to a record $19.3 million. One of the contributors to this increasing recurring revenue trend is the fact we have significantly reduced customer churn, both in absolute terms and as a percentage recurring revenue during the past few quarters. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, our customer retention levels in absolute terms improved 12% compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. Given our increasing recurring revenue levels, the improvement was significantly higher than 12% with respect to customer retention as a percentage of recurring revenue. The increasing customer satisfaction levels have helped, both with far better customer retention than before and as the good word spreads, better new business sales wins. We look forward to the days in the not-too-distant future when our annual recurring revenue levels reach the $100 million. Between recurring revenue and the highly predictable services revenue base we continue to build, our revenue predictability and visibility are getting better, making our forecasting processes progressively easier and better. Both recurring and services revenue together constitute more than 70, 7-0, 70% of current revenue level. Given our current sales and business momentum, we expect our full year fiscal 2019 revenue level to meet the 10% revenue growth guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. The January through March quarter, the last quarter of this fiscal year, should be our third consecutive year-over-year double-digit revenue growth quarter and yet another quarter with record revenue. Before I move on further, one thing to keep in mind. All our references to records or best ever performances and such refer only to our history starting mid-calender 2013 or fiscal 2014 when we divested various pieces of our business we were involved in previously and became the entirely hospitality software technology solutions-focused business that we are today. Now switching back to our Q3 fiscal 2019 results. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.1 million in both the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 third quarter periods. Last year fiscal 2018 third quarter had the benefit of $1.8 million in software development costs, which were capitalized. Given our current agile software development and deployment practices that went into effect at the start of fiscal 2019 second quarter, there were no software development costs capitalized in the fiscal 2019 third quarter. Effectively, our adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of this year was about $1.8 million better than last year's Q3, assuming no capitalization of software cost in either quarter. During the past couple of years, we have tried to give you a good financial view of our operations by using a non-GAAP measure, adjusted earnings from operations, which we also refer to as AOE. AOE is essentially adjusted EBITDA minus capitalized software costs minus CapEx, and therefore, a measure of our overall revenue minus overall expenses, whether they are capitalized or not, and minus capital expenditures. The items excluded from the AOE calculation are non-cash and certain nonrecurring cash expenditures such as restructuring costs or legal settlement payments. Over a full fiscal year, AOE should be a good proxy for free cash flow. Q3 of fiscal 2019 was our fourth consecutive positive AOE quarter at $1.9 million compared to an AOE loss of $1.9 million during Q3 of last year. The cumulative AOE during the first three quarters of this fiscal year is $4.1 million compared to an AOE loss of $6.5 million during the first 3 quarters of last year. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, AOE therefore improved year-over-year by $10.6 million while revenue increased by $8.9 million. At the beginning of fiscal 2019, during our May 2018 earnings call, we provided guidance stating that we expect to improve AOE of fiscal 2019 to a breakeven level compared to an AOE loss of $6 million in fiscal 2018. We have obviously exceeded those expectations so far. During the current January to March fourth quarter, we are planning increased capital investments in a couple of areas. Number one, expanding the India Development Center from the current capacity of 330 to 660 personnel. While we've already started the expansion process, this does not mean we will do all the hiring right now. As of now, we are creating the space and the infrastructure to grow the center, and we have completed some initial hiring. The actual pace of hiring will depend on how well our business continues to grow. Number two, the second area of capital investment plan between now and the end of March is improvements in our SaaS development operation's IT infrastructure. We expect our subscription SaaS-based revenue to continue to grow and want to ensure our infrastructure to support such growth is improved accordingly. Since AOE is a measure of adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenses, we expect AOE to be somewhere close to breakeven, not a bit less than that in Q4. Our cumulative AOE for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 was $4.1 million. We expect to round out AOE for the entire fiscal 2019 year to around $3.5 million to $4.5 million, which is an increase from the original annual guidance provided of breakeven AOE and would also mean an annual year-over-year improvement of about $10 million. Q3 fiscal 2019 was also one of our best quarters with respect to improving our cash balance. The cash balance at the end of the quarter rose to $37 million, an increase of $4.1 million from the end of the September quarter. This was achieved with no special onetime working capital management practices. We manage to a normal accounts payable and accounts receivable rhythm during the quarter. This is one of our best cash balance increase quarters ever, and that's a good reflection of our improving business reality. We've narrowed our cash losses during the first three quarters of this fiscal year to about $2.9 million compared to a cash loss of $11.6 million during the first 3 quarters of the previous year. At the beginning of fiscal 2019, we provided guidance that we expect our cash losses during fiscal 2019 to be somewhere between $3 million and $5 million compared to fiscal 2018, where our cash losses were about $9.3 million. We now expect to do better than that original guidance. We expect our cash loss for the current year to be somewhere between $0 and $3 million. In addition, we have a reasonable expectation of turning the corner and having a positive cash flow the next fiscal year. We will provide more comprehensive guidance regarding the various aspects of our business for the next fiscal year, including cash flow expectations, during our next mid-May earnings call. A word or two regarding sales. The last four quarters have been consistently good sales quarters for us, this December quarter being particularly good and one of our best sales quarters ever across all three of our current major geographical regions: U.S., Europe and Asia. We continue to make excellent progress with expanding our relatively small market share in Asia and Europe. This was also one of our best-ever quarters with respect to new business added. We define new business as a sum of three types of sales, one, new logos, meaning new customers who have never used one of our core products before. Two, new sites, meaning current customers beginning to use our core products in additional sites. And three, new products, meaning current customer sites adding one of our products they had not used before. In addition, business from our current major strategic customers continues to increase. Our efforts to expand the base of such major strategic customers are also yielding good results with continuing good progress with multiple such prospective customers. Our current sales pipeline is at the healthiest level we have seen in a long while. Our win percentage also continues to get better. Our competitive advantage is getting better with each passing month, especially on the point-of-sale, POS, side of the business, driven by our flagship InfoGenesis product complemented perfectly by rGuest Buy. We still have a few more quarters to go before we start commanding such a winning position in the property management, PMS, side of our business. Our current growth continues to be driven mostly by our POS products. We continue to focus on and invest in our PMS products as well and are confident they, too, will become significant growth drivers within the next few quarters. Our R&D and engineering resources trend has more than doubled during the past couple of years. While that helps continuing innovation and improvements in our core products, such increased strength has also helped us introduce multiple new ancillary software modules, providing the much needed innovation around POS and PMS our customers have been hungry for. Multiple such modules have been sold and implemented at various customer sites during the past few months. Apart from providing additional upsell opportunities, such modules also help us sell our core POS and PMS products more effectively while retaining and improving our pricing levels. All these software modules have been developed, sold and implemented in relatively quick time and are based on specific customer requests. We are encouraged by the possibilities in each market we serve. All the market segments we serve continue to invest in deploying technologies to improve efficiencies, to minimize disruptions, to increase process automation, to enable increasing levels of mobility and systems integration, to increase personalization levels throughout the guest journey in a resort, and every one of those aspects is in tune with our focus areas. Gaming casinos and resorts are increasingly focused on the non-gaming hospitality-related areas with their investments, and that continues to be good for us. Hotel occupancy rates have risen from approximately 60, 6-0, percent in 2001 to approximately 66% in 2018, the highest occupancy rates in nearly 30 years. Hotels, resorts, cruises, foodservice management, each of the market segments we serve has an increasing need for the kind of technology solutions we are specialized in. Technology is becoming increasingly interwoven into the guest experience in each of these industries. And in Asia and Europe to a large extent, we are only getting started. There is obviously a growing need for hospitality-focused solutions in these continents, which we are beginning to serve well now. Asia and Europe taken together, this fiscal year 2019 Q3 quarter was our best sales bookings quarter ever by a fair distance. And again, we are only getting started now. We like how well we are currently positioned to continue our business momentum and create significant future shareholder value. Within reasonable business limits, we are also fairly well insulated from the vagaries of the general political and macroeconomic environment. To start with, we serve a huge global market where the total addressable market size in terms of revenue possibilities for vendors like us runs into multiple billions, that's with a B, which is huge relative to our current size. We have a big runway to grow revenue in both the POS and PMS sides of our business. It's only a matter of how much better we can become. A small change in the rate of growth of the industry either way does not and should not affect our growth prospects. In addition to that, enterprise software for the hospitality industry is inherently challenging. Serving the kind of big customers like we do and continuing to do so at a world-class level that we do is, by definition, difficult. There's a challenging need to get the core products right, enable various kinds of integrations with third-party products and customer internally developed ancillary modules and systems, innovate well within the core products and create various ancillary products, which create value for customers, handle major complex implementations all over the world, provide world-class customer support and be there every step of the way for our customers, pick up every call from customers and partners seeking help, be there for them. Getting all of this right requires a combination of intense focus on day-to-day execution while also simultaneously keeping the innovation engine running at a high level. That combination is not an easy task for any software vendors, especially the smaller sized vendors. Now the point of all that is there are big barriers to entry into this business. While there are promising software providers coming up in the retail restaurants, QSR and other market segments we don't currently operate in, where relatively standardized one size-fits-all approach could work, such approaches will not work for the industry segments we serve. And therefore, we don't see too many major competitive threats in the enterprise hospitality space we are essentially focused on. As we continue to increase our R&D and customer services resource levels and talent strengths, as we continue to decrease our cost per unit of R&D output and become a stronger company financially, and from a management team's standpoint, we do have multiple other organic and inorganic avenues to grow our business, which we can evaluate carefully when the time is right and make well thought out, good, solid growth-driving decisions. Now on the other hand, the hospitality industry is growing and will continue to grow. Our customers are now dealing with guests who are increasingly more demanding with their technology and customer service needs. The demand for our products has never been higher. Our success depends mainly on how well we can serve such needs. From our vantage point, even if the economic conditions become a bit rocky, to a certain extent, that will only make our products even more important as our customers have to ensure they serve their guests who they are competing for even better. Due to a general lack of software technology providers of our size in this industry who are not too big, not small by any stretch and stable, focused only on the hospitality industry and improving with respect to products and customer service, we feel we are well positioned and will continue to grow if we keep our focus and work relentlessly hard and smart. We believe our fate is essentially in our hands. We are not too dependent on the economic environment around us. And one cannot ask for a better position than that. Without question, like all businesses, we do wish for a good business, political and economic environment to help us continue to do well. But we like our position of not being too dependent on such external variables. In summary, we like our current sales and business momentum. We are now moving past the turnaround phase and entering into a growth phase in our business. During the past two years, we have worked hard. We have worked smart to turn around our business. And starting now, it's a matter of how well we manage our growth possibilities. This is an exciting time for us. With the turnaround-related heavy lifting behind us, we are now focused on our future growth path, which frankly is a lot more fun to manage. We are determined to stay humble, work hard, serve our employees, our customers, our products, our processes well, outwork our competition as best as we can, be the most reliable, always available, most innovative and improving partner for our customers and an organization which always keeps the best interest of our shareholders in mind. Consistent profitable growth is the road ahead for us. We like the pathway we are marching along now and remain confident in our future. We look forward to discussing our January through March quarter, Q4 of fiscal 2019 results mid-May. We have every expectation that will be yet another record revenue quarter for us. With that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Tony Pritchett, to provide additional perspective on our financial results and other aspects of our business. Tony?
Anthony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh, and hello, everyone. Echoing Ramesh's remarks, we are pleased with our fiscal 2019 third quarter results. More so, we are pleased with the continued progress we are making with our initiatives and their benefit to our operations and key financial metrics, including double-digit topline growth, progress towards becoming a cash-generating company and positioning the company for further growth. Starting with our topline. Overall revenue grew by 15% or $4.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 to $36 million. That compares to $31.3 million in the prior year period, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and the third consecutive quarterly revenue record since becoming a pure-play hospitality technology provider in calendar 2013, fiscal 2014. Third quarter revenue grew by over $1.8 million or 5% sequentially from $34.2 million in the second quarter of this fiscal year. Importantly, we continue to improve and grow the business while being laser-focused on our cost line items. As a reminder, and as discussed on our Q2 call, we adopted agile development and deployment practices across all of our products earlier this fiscal year that preclude the ability for us to capitalize internal labor cost onto the balance sheet. The second quarter of this fiscal year was the first quarter we saw the effect of these practices on our income statement. The same effect has carried into the third quarter. As a result, our product development expense line item on the income statement is significantly higher than in prior year quarters since the cost that was previously removed from the P&L as capitalized software development costs and capitalized onto the balance sheet is now being reflected as an expense. In Q3 of fiscal 2018, this was about $1.8 million. In the back of our earnings release, you will see a reconciliation of product development expense for Q3 of fiscal 2018 to include this amount. As an effect, our operating loss and net loss are higher this quarter than they would have been if we had capitalized labor. In addition, our operating cash flows on the cash flow statement now including wages and contract labor payments that were previously capitalized, whereas previous quarters reflected a fixed expenditure as an investing activity. Also, please note that in accordance with the modified retrospective method of adopting the new revenue recognition standards, which we adopted beginning with Q1 of fiscal 2019, our March 31 balance sheet has not been restated to reflect the accounting standards. Therefore, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other non-current assets, contract assets and contract liabilities are not directly comparable on the face of the balance sheet. Please refer to the full disclosure in the notes to our consolidated financials in our 10-Q, which will be filed soon, for more disclosure to help with comparison. Now looking at revenue in greater detail. Product revenue increased 25.5% to $10.2 million compared to $8.2 million in the prior year period as a result of higher hardware and proprietary software license sales on the back of one of our best sales quarters. Professional services revenue was up 8.4% to $6.4 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting growth in our customer base. Support, maintenance and subscription services or recurring revenue rose 12.4% to a quarterly record $19.3 million compared to $17.2 million in the prior year period. We are pleased with our continued growth across our recurring revenue, particularly the 25% increase in subscription revenue, which continues to trend ahead of previously stated expectations of approximately 20% year-over-year growth. Recurring revenue was 54% of total revenue with subscription revenue representing approximately 32% of recurring revenues, marking steady growth compared to 29% in Q3 of last year. Also of note is that total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 9% of total fiscal 2019 third quarter revenue. We are pleased to see rGuest gaining traction in the marketplace and are very anxious to see what we expect to be a significant contribution as we further leverage rGuest Buy, rGuest Stay and bring to market emerging modules such as rGuest OnDemand, rGuest Book and rGuest Service. Looking ahead to the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect the sales momentum to continue and help us to further our top line growth and for subscription revenue to outpace the rate of total recurring revenue growth. Regarding installed endpoints, by the end of Q3, we serviced about 53,000 terminal endpoints and 271,000 rooms. That translates to a 19% and 6% increase, respectively, compared to Q3 of last year. Moving down the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased by 10.7% or $1.7 million during the third quarter to $17.4 million versus $15.7 million in the prior year period. Of note is that gross margin of all product lines increased compared to the third quarter of last year, meaning that although cost of goods sold increased, it increased at a lower rate than revenue. The largest contribution to the overall cost of goods sold increase was products cost of goods sold, which increased by $1.6 million, of which $700,000 was due to the increase in amortization of developed technology. And the balance was due to an increase in third party hardware and related operating system software, which carries with it a hard cost of buying the products from vendors. This led to a gross profit margin of 51.8% or a 190 basis point improvement over the prior year period. Products gross profit increased $0.5 million with gross profit margin improving to 18.2%. The increase in gross profit margin can be attributed to higher software license sales and reduced supply chain costs as a result of processing customer orders directly out of our own warehouse. Professional services gross profit increased by $0.1 million with gross profit margin increasing to 21% compared to 20.4% in Q3 of fiscal 2018 as a result of increased revenue and higher utilization and billability of our professional services resources. Our margins were at the low end of our expected range due to the mix of projects handled during the quarter. We continue to expect services margins to range from the low 20s to the high 20s, depending on the mix of projects in any particular quarter. Support, maintenance and subscription services gross profit increased $2.4 million, leading to a total gross margin of 79.8% compared to 76% in Q3 of fiscal 2018, reflecting the positive impact of the operational changes we have implemented and the success of our initiatives to grow recurring revenue at a faster pace than cost. Looking at operating expenses and excluding the charges for legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges, the third quarter saw a 20.1% increase in operating expenses to $22.5 million compared to $18.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses is due primarily to product development expenses, which increased by $2.8 million compared to fiscal Q3 of last year. As discussed, we have dramatically reduced the timelapse between design of a software product or feature and its deployment in the field. In Q3, this precluded capitalization of software development costs, and we expect similar outcomes going forward. This change, along with the growth in our number of global R&D resources, led to the increase. Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.9 million or 21.9% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year due to increased incentive compensation and the timing of tradeshows, while general and administrative expenses decreased $0.2 million or 4.1% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year. As was the case in the prior quarter, our overall expense level, when normalizing the treatment of capitalized software development by taking both capital expense and operating expense together as a percentage of revenue, was lower in the fiscal 2019 third quarter compared to the same period last year. And our expectation remains that we will leverage the operating scale of the business and grow revenue at a faster rate than cost. Our fiscal 2019 third quarter results led to an operating loss of $3.9 million compared to an operating loss of $3.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Our operating loss mainly widened as a result of the classification of capitalized software development costs. Our fiscal 2019 third quarter net loss was $4 million compared to $1.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Our net loss widened due to the classification of capitalized software development costs as well as a $1.6 million tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2.1 million in the third quarter of both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. However, as reconciled in the back of our earnings release, if software development costs were not capitalized in either period, adjusted EBITDA would show an improvement of $1.9 million over a gain in the fiscal 2018 third quarter of $300,000. Adjusted earnings from operations or AOE for Q3 of fiscal 2019 was $1.9 million, a $3.8 million improvement compared to a loss of $1.9 million in Q3 of fiscal 2018. This is a metric unaffected by the classification of capitalized software development costs. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018, was $37 million compared to $32.9 million at September 30, 2018. Free cash flow, defined as cash used in operating activities plus cash used for capital expenditures and cash used for capitalized software development costs, is a good cash flow metric to look at for us. Free cash flow for the 9 months ended December 31, 2018, was a record for us. Free cash outflows of $2.1 million in the first 9 months of this year favorably compares to $10.5 million in the first half - in the first 9 months of last year, which is over an $8 million improvement. Going forward, we expect fiscal 2019 year-end cash and cash equivalents to be flat to down $3 million from the fiscal 2018 year-end balance of $39.9 million. And we expect to end the year with $37 million to $40 million of cash on hand, a significant improvement from the $9.3 million decline in fiscal 2018. Regarding our revenue and AOE guidance, we reiterated this afternoon our forecast for fiscal 2019 full year revenue growth of approximately 10% compared to fiscal 2018 revenue of approximately $127 million. In addition, we expect to report full year adjusted earnings from operations of between $3.5 million and $4.5 million in fiscal 2019. That compares to a loss of approximately $6 million for this metric last year. In closing, while we have a lot of work ahead, we should not lose sight of the fact that fiscal 2019 is so far proving to be a very strong year. We have set several financial records this year and at the same time set ourselves up for future growth and consistent profitability. As Ramesh noted, we continue to be bullish on the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2019 and beyond. I would now like to open the call to questions. Sonia?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Allen Klee of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: Yes, hello. Congrats on a great quarter. I had a couple financial questions to start with. In terms of gross margins, if I look at your segments, the product segment and the recurring-type revenues, they're continuing to improve the last couple of quarters. And you had a little uptick in the professional one this quarter. Is that - are those a trend that I should think as kind of continuing and it kind of ends up with the overall gross margin roughly flat? Or is there any other color you can add to that?
Anthony Pritchett: Allen, I think the way to think of it is if you just take our overall gross margin, it should continue to improve. We expect our recurring revenue to continue to grow, and our subscription revenue should grow faster than any the line of revenue. And those lines of revenue carry the highest gross margins that we have, right? Incremental revenue added to recurring revenue comes with really high gross margins. So over time, our margins should start to tick up or continue to tick up. If you think about the different product lines, product revenue and services revenue can be somewhat lumpy when it comes to gross margin percentages. Services changes from quarter-to-quarter just kind of based on the project mix that we have going on in a given quarter, and like I mentioned on the call, we expect services margins to be somewhere in the low 20s to high 20% range. But again, it kind of varies quarter-to-quarter. And then product margins can vary depending on the mix of software license revenue that we have. It can vary a decent amount as far as the percentage goes, but the way to think about it over time is just that on an ongoing basis and over the next several quarters and years, our overall margin should continue to improve.
Allen Klee: Great. And then the operating expenses below gross margins, is it reasonable to think that kind of stays at kind of the run rate it's been at as a percent of sales?
Anthony Pritchett: Yes. So where we are now for the next few quarters is a generally good expectation. We have said - I think we said it on the last call that product development expense next year probably ticks up a couple or 3 percentage points from where it is now. On the whole though, if you think about on an annual basis and you start thinking about next year, our overall cost as a percentage of revenue should continue to be about in this range or maybe come down a little bit with that nuance for product development expense ticking up a little bit. Does that answer your question?
Allen Klee: Yes. And then just remind me with the building out of the India Development Center. I wasn't quite sure of what the impact that has on CapEx. Maybe you said it and I missed it, I'm sorry.
Anthony Pritchett: So the initial cost to build out the facility - in that facility, we rent space in a complex in India. So we have about 68,000 square feet there. We're building out about half of that right now. We will see a decent contribution to CapEx in Q4 from that build-out. That's why we expect AOE to be close to breakeven, possibly slightly negative in Q4. It's because of that CapEx that we are going to spend in Q4.
Allen Klee: That's right. Thank you. And you - could you just repeat the percentage increases of point-of-sale and hotel rooms served, what that was year-over-year? And what I'm trying to think about is right now, it sounds like point of sales has been growing high double digits and PMS has been growing kind of like high single digit. But you've alluded to that in a couple of quarters, it's possible that PMS could pick up its growth rate once you build out the products. So was there a way to think about the relative kind of size of a typical POS versus a hotel type of a deal and profitability so that maybe that can help us think about what this could mean a couple of quarters out when the PMS hopefully ramps up?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. So - Allen, thank you. This is Ramesh. We would think of POS and PMS as two fairly distinct separate businesses. POS sales involve both software and hardware typically because you sell terminals along with the POS software. PMS is a classic application software sale. It's only software when we sell PMS. And the two are fairly independent. I mean, certain customers will prefer buying both from us. That is always there. But in general, they are not going to make a decision to buy one just because they have the other from us. We have to win each of them based on the merit of our products and service and support and all the variables that go into a selection process. So dollar-for-dollar, I would say PMS is more profitable for us because it doesn't involve hardware. And currently, competitive advantage-wise, it is difficult to say no to us on a POS RFP. PMS, we have a bit more work to do. That doesn't mean we don't win PMS deals now. But in order for PMS growth to also reach the 20% range, we just have a few more quarters of work to do on the product. And all our success, all our growth is mostly product-driven, Allen. When the products become - when the products reach a stage when they are obviously competitively the better products, everything else flows easier for us. And on the PMS products, we just have a few more quarters of work to do, and that only makes me think positive as far as revenue growth is concerned. Currently, POS is pulling as well, but once PMS also starts pulling, our revenue should really start growing at an even faster pace.
Allen Klee: That's very helpful because it sounds like not only it was could revenue growth better but also profitability if PMS is a little more profitable. Thank you. And then on the competitive position, you talked about your advantages versus some of companies that are maybe smaller than yourselves and can't be as innovative. But how do you think you're competing with the kind of £800 gorilla, the big guy out there? Are you seeing anything that makes you worry more than normal? Or what are you thinking?
Ramesh Srinivasan: I think if anything, I'm worrying a bit less these days. If anything, during the last couple of quarters, as can be seen by the sales results, our competitive advantage is increasing. Our position is becoming better. Based on what we see in the marketplace, it does feel like we are making more progress with our core products, with our innovation within the core products in terms of adding features and doing what will produce value for customers. We are coming out with ancillary products around POS and PMS at a faster rate than the competition. That's how it seems like to us. And given our - the current momentum of increasing sales, I'll tell you that I think our competitive advantage is getting better. It's a positive move. And from the bigger competitors, I think we are better in terms of customer service and how much attention we pay to customers, mainly because this is the only industry we are focused on. So things are getting better, Allen, from a competitive advantage and from a selling standpoint.
Allen Klee: Okay. Great. And then it was nice to hear how international has ticked up in the quarter. Any - is there anything you can point to of your actions that you think is going to be supporting that going forward?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, Allen. So majority of why we are beginning to make an impact with our international selling and revenue is also product-driven. The products needed features that our European and Asian customers required, which for a long time we did not get done. So those features are getting done now. And therefore, our products have competitive advantage in Asia and Europe as well. And in addition, we are also increasing our presence there. We've added sales staff there. We've added support staff there. The fact that the India Development Center is in Asia obviously helps. We are able to service our Asia customers a lot quicker these days. So all of that is contributing to our international sales and revenue levels picking up. The products are - now have the features those markets require, plus we have more stable offices there. We are adding sales staff. We are adding support staff. All that is helping.
Allen Klee: Okay. And then maybe just lastly, could you talk about some of the newer software modules or maybe stuff that came from the customer that you feel most promising about?
Ramesh Srinivasan: All of them are beginning to make an impact, but I will just touch on a couple of them for you, Allen. One is rGuest Book, which is a web-based booking engine, that multiple customers came to us and wanted us to develop our own booking engine which integrates well with our property management system because customers want -- when you go to a website to book a room, they want to differentiate between, say, a platinum player and a gold player and make different kinds of offers to them. And that booking engine can do only if it has visibility to the PMS data. So we develop that. One customer went live, if I'm not mistaken, in the May-June time frame. One major Vegas customer is going live as we speak now in the next couple of weeks. And one other major customer in Vegas is in the process of going live, say, in the next three, four weeks or so. So that process is making -- that product is making good progress. And then we have rGuest Express Mobile, which is a mobile phone-based check-in, checkout, so that you don't need to stand in a queue. We also have an Express Kiosk that has gone live and is in the process of expanding to more kiosks in the casino in Las Vegas again. rGuest OnDemand is a product that enables desktop ordering and mobile ordering. And a couple of major customers are looking at it now, and we have actually signed a couple of deals just in the last one or two weeks. rGuest car, golf activity. So basically, we have additional modules to our PMS that handles car management and golf management. There are customers who are in the process of buying that. And in addition to all of this, like we have other mobile ordering features that we are adding to InfoGenesis, and there is a whole lot of features we have recently added in the last six months to our rGuest Stay product. So that product is getting filled up with PMS features. So in terms of software improvements, ancillary products and core products, we are a long way ahead now than we were six months ago. And we expect that rate of improvement to continue over the next six months and only get quicker after that.
Allen Klee: That’s great. Thank you so much.
Ramesh Srinivasan: You’re welcome, Allen.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And this does conclude for question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ramesh for any closing remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Sonia. Thank you all for your continued interest in Agilysys. Please enjoy a couple of terrific weeks around the Super Bowl, and we'll talk to you soon mid-May. Thank you.

Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal year 2019 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today will be Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer. Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.2%, that’s 14.2, increased 14.2% over the comparable quarter last year to a record $36.6 million. Q4 fiscal 2019 was our third consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth quarter, the fourth consecutive record revenue quarter and the sixth consecutive sequential revenue growth quarter. Our sales momentum continues to be strong. The third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 were two of our strongest ever with respect to overall global sales. That sales momentum trend has continued into the first half of our current Q1 fiscal 2020 quarter as well. And we seem well set to make this current Q1 FY ‘20 our fifth consecutive record revenue quarter. Our full year fiscal 2019 revenue was $140.8 million, that is 1-4-0, $140.8 million, slightly exceeding our expectations and just above our full year revenue guidance of 10% growth over fiscal 2018 revenue. For the full year, our overall recurring revenue base grew by $6.4 million over the prior year. The largest single year increase since we became a pure play hospitality software solutions provider during fiscal 2014 and included a 24% increase in full year subscription revenue compared to fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings from operations or AOE was positive during each quarter in fiscal 2019, adding up to $4.8 million for the year, approximately $10.7 million better than fiscal 2018 and well ahead of our original expectations and guidance provided. Adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 13%, 1-3, 13% year-over-year to $10.3 million. Free cash flow was $1.7 million for the year, our first such positive free cash flow year since before fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2019 was an important milestone year for us, where in we made the transition from a turnaround company to a growth company. We executed on a number of transformational positive initiatives across almost every aspect of our business that have set us up well for continued and sustainable profitable growth. Fiscal 2019 was by far our best year with respect to international sales. One of our key strategic initiatives continues to be to make Agilysys an engineering driven company, consistently innovating, creating and enhancing great products, and we made substantial progress with that objective. Our overall R&D and technical services personnel grew from approximately 450 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to 510 by the end of the year, helping us drive our products forward at a pace far higher than at any time in our history and I suspect quite possibly faster than most of our competition. During fiscal 2019, we made substantial improvements with all our core product sets, including point-of-sale, property management systems, inventory and procurement, document management and data analysis. Our increased pace of innovation significantly improved our core products, and in addition, helped us create and implement high value ancillary software modules around the core POS and PMS products. Most of these additional modules have been sold and implemented in at least a couple of customer sites each during fiscal 2019. Along with a couple of crucial mobile-enabled software modules, which add value to our POS products, the majority of the additional software modules have been valuable additions to our core PMS product sales. Such additional software modules command good pricing, comparable to the pricing of the core products, and will play an increasingly crucial role in driving our revenue growth, and increased profitability. Our customers today cater to guests with high expectations regarding technology efficacy. The additional modules we’ve brought to the market in the recent past cater to that exact mean. Each of these additional software modules integrate seamlessly across all our core PMS products, allowing for less integration work and good value for our customers and in turn for us as well. During fiscal 2019, we developed and implemented the following additional software modules, all well integrated with our core PMS products. One, rGuest Book, a web booking system that is arguably the only booking engine in the market today that integrates with major loyalty and revenue management systems, allowing for truly personalized and differentiated booking experiences for each loyalty tier level of guests. Two, rGuest Express Mobile, a mobile check-in, check-out module that enables guests to check in by room upgrades, make dining reservations, do digital ID verification, check-out and receive room ready SMS notifications, all from the convenience of their own mobile device. This module is the industry’s first fully integrated check-in, check-out solution with digital ID verification and digital key delivery. Three, rGuest Express Kiosk, a self-service kiosk that allows guests to check in and out of their rooms, while balancing ease of guest use with security considerations of the hotel operators and includes innovative features like soft check in and the ability to purchase upgrades at the time of check in. rGuest Service four, this software module facilitates resort-wide staff communication and integrated customer service and is designed to mobilize all internal workflows by using wearable technology, thereby enabling all staff to receive instant housekeeping, in-room dining, concierge and other alerts. Additionally, we are a few months away from implementing new modules for golf and spa facilities that will help our customers operate more efficiently and leverage customer data from across the guest journey. As we continue to improve our PMS products to drive the level of revenue growth that exceeds the current POS revenue growth rate, we are simultaneously strengthening the ecosystem around PMS to further leverage the PMS competitive advantage we are working toward. While POS is carrying the bulk of our revenue growth currently, we expect PMS to begin contributing significantly to our growth during the upcoming years. Regarding our POS food and beverage business, we continue to add solutions that bring the point-of-sale to the guest in dynamic ways that improve guest experience and provide operational efficiency to our customers. We will soon be implementing the InfoGenesis mobile order application, which enables restaurant staff to carry out most of their order taking functions using consumer grade iOS or Android devices or even cellphones. This is in addition to the InfoGenesis Flex application that we have implemented at many customer sites over the past several years, which is essentially a full featured InfoGenesis terminal application optimized for mobile devices. We round out our POS offerings with the guests facing rGuest Buy Kiosk and our recently implemented rGuest Buy on demand module, which enables restaurant guests to order directly from their mobile phone or PC before going to the F&B location for pickup. What makes this value proposition even more attractive for our customers is that, we are able to provide all this functionality through a single integrated menu, price and order management functionality set driven by the core point-of-sale application InfoGenesis, instead of the multiple disparate systems many properties are currently having to deal with. During this quarter, we also implemented a new rGuest Pay and Go module, which is a new payment app that gives the guests control to tender their checks from their mobile device, including the ability to add tips and split checks. It further enhances the guest experience and helps our customers turn over their tables faster. The vastly improved engineering strength along with a sharp culture shift to become obsessively customer-centric has helped us significantly improve how we serve our customers. This is reflected in the fact, fiscal 2019 saw the lowest customer churn in the past four years in spite of operating with a far higher recurring revenue base. Increasing recurring revenue and decreasing customer churn together led to our lowest customer churn year in percentage terms. Customer retention as a percentage of recurring revenue during fiscal 2019 improved 10% over fiscal 2018 and 25% over fiscal 2017. Our customer retention rate was significantly higher than 95% during fiscal 2019. During Q4, 22 new customers joined the Agilysys family, bringing the total to 89 new customers for the year. Fiscal 2019 was our best year ever with respect to competitor replacements, especially during the second half of the year. Continuing to grow our market share in a steadily expanding overall market is a great position to be in. Being entirely focused as we are on the hospitality industry and serving it well by balancing day-to-day execution and future innovation simultaneously is not an easy task. And we are happy to be handling the challenge seemingly better than most of the competition. With respect to the various market verticals we serve, we continue to thrive and grow in the gaming sector as that industry continues its shift toward non-gaming amenities and focuses on non-gaming revenue growth. During Q4 fiscal 2019, about five different casino operators switched from a competitor system to Agilysys products. With respect to the hotels, resorts and cruises market vertical, Q4 was one of our biggest ever sales quarters in this segment. Apart from many new customer, competitive replacements, and other wins across various hotels and resorts, the highlight of the quarter was a successful pilot go-live on a major new cruise customer ship where we replaced a competitor’s system with InfoGenesis and InfoGenesis Flex and helped automate many processes within the ship, making the handling of food and beverage orders and fulfillment across multiple restaurants and bars a lot more efficient. The other major highlight of the quarter was the expansion of our foodservice management, FSM business. We continue to expand our partnership with a major FSM customer, who we have had a longstanding relationship with and we recently completed a successful pilot install at one of their major clients, again replacing a competitor system. We expect to expand our implementation with that important client during the next few quarters. Apart from that, we are also in the early stages of expanding our business with a couple of other major FSM providers, who are relatively new customers for us. In addition, we made significant breakthroughs into the healthcare, senior living and higher education, FSM market segments and are getting close to a breakthrough in the sports and entertainment area. These are all market segments, which have not been areas of strengths for us in the past. With our increased product development strength, we are now able to provide the required product functionality these new customers require. During fiscal 2019, our marketing efforts were a lot more focused on our key messages and played a big part in Q3 and Q4 being two of our strongest sales quarters ever. The overall stability and increasing constructive teamwork among the management team was another highlight of fiscal 2019. Apart from the addition of Jeba Kingsley to head US professional services teams about six months ago, all the members of the current management team were with us at the start of the fiscal year and continue to drive our progress now. All things considered, the biggest highlight of fiscal 2019 is the major improvement in sales processes and sales results across our three major geographical regions US, Asia and Europe. Fiscal 2019 was our best global sales year since we became entirely focused on hospitality software solutions in fiscal 2014. Along with having more and improving products, together with improving customer service levels, our sales processes have become a lot more disciplined with a far higher level of accountability for forecasts and for results. Now looking forward to fiscal 2020, we expect to grow revenue at a similar rate as last year. We expect our revenue levels to grow approximately 11% in fiscal 2020 from the approximately $141 million revenue level in fiscal 2019. We continue to enjoy good operating leverage and expect to grow profitability faster than our revenue growth rate. In spite of no longer having the benefit of capitalized software development costs unlike previous years, we still expect to grow adjusted EBITDA by around 25% in fiscal 2020 to approximately $13 million. As a result, free cash flow generated during fiscal 2020 should be well ahead of the $1.7 million generated during fiscal 2019. In summary, we are pleased to get past the turnaround phase and enter a growth phase across all our business areas. We worked hard for it, but we are also lucky to be in a marketplace largely insulated from the short-term economic vagaries and market fluctuations created by the daily news cycle. We will continue to work hard and smart to translate our successful efforts to growing shareholder value. Our annual revenue level is still a small fraction of the total addressable market we operate in, and even more so, when we look at the vast opportunities before us in Asia and Europe. A long growth runway is ahead of us. It is great we are in a growing industry with an increasing need for a world-class technology vendor, who is focused on serving the industry with a broad range of products backed up by world-class services and support. Even if that industry growth rate were to slow down a bit due to external reasons, our growth path will continue as we keep expanding our competitive edge. Our future is clearly in our own hands and not too dependent on anything else. As we continue to get better, we will also perform better. Our top line growth will continue to be driven forward by many factors, but none more important and impactful as subscription recurring revenue, which grew by 24% during the full fiscal year 2019. The top line growth will continue to outpace required cost investment increases, thereby driving profitability at an even faster clip. We look forward to catching up with all of you again in our next earnings call a couple of months from now when we will report on what should be our fifth consecutive record revenue quarter. We expect Q1 of fiscal 2020 to be the first quarter in which we exceed the $38 million quarterly revenue milestone. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tony Pritchett for further color on our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thanks, Ramesh. To echo Ramesh’s comments, we are pleased with the results for both the fiscal fourth quarter and for the full year. We are very encouraged by the growth trajectory we see in our business as we are more confident than ever in our ability to grow top line and leverage our momentum down to the bottom line to create shareholder value. Throughout the fiscal year, we made significant progress on our key financial priorities, including lowering overall costs, total OpEx and CapEx as a percentage of revenue and positioning the Company for growth through the result of success of the strategic initiatives we put in place over the past two years. We are pleased with the success we are having with sales and the positive impact that it’s having on our overall business momentum. Taking a look at our financial results, beginning with our income statement, fourth quarter fiscal 2019 revenue was $36.6 million, a 14.2% increase from total net revenue of $32.1 million in the comparable prior year period. This marks our fourth consecutive record revenue quarter and our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The increase in top line largely reflects the 37.5% increase in product revenue to $10.9 million and a 7.1% increase in recurring revenue to $19.4 million. On an annual basis, we are pleased to see growth across all three of our revenue line items, including a $6.4 million increase in recurring revenue, our largest annual increase in recurring revenue to-date. Total recurring revenue represented 52.9% of total net revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter and 53.6% for the full year. That compares to 56.4% and 54.2% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018. We are also pleased with our robust subscription revenue growth, which grew at 23% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 24% for the full fiscal year. Subscription revenues comprised approximately 34% of total recurring revenues, compared to 30% of total recurring revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect total recurring revenue to continue to grow and for subscription revenue growth to continue to outpace the rate of total recurring revenue growth and remain in the 20% growth rate range for fiscal 2020. Both of which are important measures of progress and a good reference point regarding the health of the business. With regard to endpoints, we currently serve approximately 271,000 rooms and have approximately 54,000 terminal endpoints or up 5% and 16%, respectively compared to how we exited Q4 of last year. Total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 9% of total fiscal 2019 fourth quarter revenue, which is up 200 basis points year-over-year. Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold increased by 11.2% or $1.7 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year period, mainly as a result of the increase in product sales, including third-party costs associated with more hardware revenue and to a lesser extent, higher amortization of software development costs. Cost of goods sold decreased 3.5% for support, maintenance, and subscription services, and 5% for professional services in spite of the revenue growth we saw in both, reflecting the success we are having with our cost initiatives. This led to a total gross profit of $19.6 million, a 17% or $2.8 million improvement from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit margin improved 126 basis points to 53.5% compared to 52.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Taking a closer look, products gross margin improved to 21.2% in Q4 of fiscal 2019 from 17.8% in the prior year period primarily as a result of higher software revenue related to licensing our software to customers. Recurring revenue gross margin for Q4 fiscal of 2019 improved to 79.7% from 77.4% in the prior year period on the back of the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers and the positive impact of the changes mentioned earlier. Professional services gross margin also improved from 21.9% in Q4 of fiscal 2018 to 29.2% in Q4 of fiscal 2019. We are pleased with our ability to improve on our gross margin, a measure we continue to be very much focused on as we feel it reflects the improved quality of our revenue and ability to control costs. Going forward for fiscal 2020, we expect total gross profit margins to continue with modest improvement, similar to what we have seen in the last couple of years. Looking at operating expenses, excluding charges for legal settlements and restructuring, severance and other charges, the fourth quarter saw a 25% increase in operating expenses to $23.1 million compared to $18.4 million in the prior year period. Half of this increase is attributable to the fact that we no longer capitalize software development costs. As a reminder and as discussed on prior calls, we adopted agile development and deployment practices across all of our products earlier this fiscal year that preclude the ability for us to capitalize internal labor costs onto the balance sheet. The second quarter of this fiscal year was the first quarter we saw the effect of these practices on our income statement. The same effect has carried into the third and fourth quarters. As a result, our product development expense line item on the income statement is significantly higher than in prior years. Since the cost that was previously removed from the P&L as capitalized software development costs and capitalized onto the balance sheet is now being reflected as an expense. In the back of our press release, you will find a reconciliation of product development expense to include these amounts. As an effect of this change, our operating loss and net loss are higher this quarter than they would have been, if we had capitalized labor. This also affects operating cash flows as wages and contract labor payments that were previously capitalized now reflect as an operating cash outflow. Now looking at our operating expense line items in more detail, product development expense increased by $3.3 million or 46% compared to fiscal Q4 of last year, about two-thirds of which was due to the change we implemented beginning in the fiscal 2019 second quarter to no longer capitalize software development costs and the remainder was due to the extra costs for higher bonus eligibility due to better financial performance in fiscal year ‘19 versus fiscal year ‘18. Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.8 million or 18.5% compared to fiscal Q4 of last year, while general and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million or 9.1% compared to fiscal Q4 of last year both mainly attributable to higher incentive compensation associated with our financial performance. Our operating loss of $3.8 million for the fourth quarter compares to an operating loss of $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $3.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share, which did not include the $1.8 million non-cash income tax benefit or approximately $1.6 million in software development costs capitalization, both of which were a benefit to net income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2019 was $40.8 million compared to $39.9 million at March 31,2018. This is in line with our prior guidance to end this fiscal year with a cash balance at or slightly above $38.5 million and it’s notable because it marks the first time, we have generated cash during a full fiscal year since fiscal 2014. We are pleased with our ability to manage our liquidity as we continue to invest in the business, including in the development of our solutions and execute on our initiatives. As it relates to our free cash flow, I am pleased to see an increase in net cash provided by operating activities, which rose from $6.9 million to $7.2 million for the 12 months ended March 31, 2019 even with the headwind of previously capitalized engineering costs not reflected in operating cash flows. As has been historically the case, we do expect the first half of the coming year to be a drag on cash, especially during the first quarter, which will be more than made up in the second half of the year resulting in significantly improved free cash flows for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Looking at adjusted earnings from operations, we posted a set of $0.7 million gain for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $0.6 million in the prior year period. A slight improvement even while incurring $0.9 million more of CapEx during the current quarter for the expansion of our India Development Center and investment in our SaaS development and operations IT infrastructure. And on an annual basis, AOE improved to a $4.8 million gain compared to a $6 million loss in fiscal 2018. Since we are no longer incurring the capital expense of capitalized software development costs, starting this fiscal year, we will focus more on adjusted EBITDA as a profitability metric, rather than adjusted earnings from operations. For the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 million compared to $3.1 million in the year ago quarter. However, assuming no software development costs were capitalized in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter would have been around $1.4 million or $1 million less than the current year. In terms of our NOLs, we continue to carry approximately $210 million of NOL carry-forwards with a full valuation allowance on our books that will help us remain liable for taxes only in certain foreign jurisdictions, along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our current NOLs expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2038. Finally, taking a look at our guidance, revenue growth is expected to continue in the double-digit range in fiscal 2020 as we expect revenue growth of approximately 11% and for subscription revenue to continue to grow in the 20% range. In addition, we expect adjusted EBITDA to improve to nearly $13 million, a 25% improvement over fiscal 2019. And as we mentioned, we expect to generate meaningful increase in free cash flows over the fiscal 2019 full year $1.7 million mark. In closing, we are pleased with our 2019 financial results and with our improving revenue mix becoming more predictable everyday. With our continued focus on prudent management of our cost structure, we are confident in our ability to achieve ongoing profitable growth as our guidance for fiscal 2020 reflects. We have both the resources and the capital flexibility we need to continue to support and invest in our products and in our people, and to diligently and effectively pursue new opportunities. We are confident that fiscal 2020 will mark another year of growth and overall improvement for Agilysys. With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to the operator. Liz?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: Yes, hi. I missed you said something about what you expected your next fiscal quarter revenues to exceed I thought you said $38 million, but could you clarify that. And then can you just remind us of how we should think about any seasonality throughout the year?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Hi, Allen. Thanks for joining the call. Yes, I did say that based on our sales momentum was very good in Q3, Q4 of last year and so far, we have almost done with half the quarter now of this quarter and that momentum continues. So, based on all of that, I did say that there’s a high probability we’ll cross – we will exceed the $38 million mark for the first time in our history. So that is one. As far as cyclicality in our business, there is really not much cyclicality in our business at all. Like you see with our consecutive sequential growth, we are just getting better quarter-after-quarter like six consecutive sequential quarter growth. Our business is getting better, our market share is getting better. We have more products to offer to our customers. So, it’s getting better. So, there’s no cyclicality in our business at all, with the exception of one aspect, which is cash balance. Our cash tends to be bit of a challenge in Q1 and Q2 where there are certain expenses that happen and also a lot of our maintenance invoices tend to go in the second half of the year. So, the cash balance alone will tend to go down in Q1 and Q2 and then more than make up for it in Q3 and Q4. That is about the only part of our business I would call cyclical, Allen.
Allen Klee: Okay, thank you. And can you tell us where you had set a goal of doubling the amount of people, I believe, in your India Development Center. Can you give us an idea of where that stands and then of the spend expenses that you’re planning to spend in fiscal ‘20, is there a way we can think of like how much extra spending there is to get to that higher level. What I’m trying to figure out is, if it might be the expense run rate at least the incremental increases maybe at a little higher rate than a normalized rate would be there after. Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. Hi, Allen. Yes. Just to clarify, Allen, what we set about what we said about the India Development Center is that, we have created the space and the infrastructure to double the people. Like we initially had a capacity of 330 and we said we will double it to 660 and get the infrastructure ready. But how much of the 660 we hire is going to be carefully balanced against how our sales grows and how our revenue grows. So, our objective does remain that we will grow revenue at a faster pace than costs, and that applies to R&D as much as it applies to any of our other OpEx headlines OpEx heads. So, we will be growing R&D revenue fast. We will be growing revenue faster than we grow R&D costs. And how much we hire in India will depend on how our sales and revenue grows. At the moment, our India Development Center is about, it’s crossed the 400 mark, it’s a little higher than 400. But there is no specific plan we are committed to as to how quickly we will grow that to 660. It will we’ll just grow it along with our business. Currently, when you look at our product development expense in our GAAP P&L, it looks like those costs have gone up, while actually it is more because we are not capitalizing software cost now and we were before, and you just have to work through that. But in general, we do expect revenue to grow faster than our R&D expense. Tony, you have something to add to that?
Tony Pritchett: Yes. And just, for a little bit more clarity and precision, Allen, if you look at our P&L, our operating expense line items are product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. As we’ve said over the last couple quarters, since we announced the expansion of the IDC, we do expect product development expense to probably tick up a couple of percentage points next year. That’s on an annual basis. If you look at our current product development as a percentage of revenue on an annual basis, you can apply that to next year and add a couple of percentage points likely. And then sales and marketing and G&A combined, they stay about flat, they might come down a little bit to offset that increase of product development expense. So overall, you’re looking at as a percentage of revenue, our OpEx should stay fairly consistent.
Allen Klee: Thank you. And any thoughts on what CapEx would be for the year?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. So, we’re looking at CapEx next year that’s a little bit higher than what we saw in fiscal ‘19, not substantially, but probably increases a little bit from where we were in fiscal ‘19.
Allen Klee: Okay, alright. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks, Allen.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. Your line is now open.
Tim Klasell: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter. My first question has to do with this is sort of the, obviously the time of the year where you have set your sales quotas and territories and goals, what have you, I’m sure. Can you sort of maybe, even just qualitatively tell us where you are directing maybe additional sales efforts and resources this year? Are there particular geography or product set that is getting extra attention for this fiscal year? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. Sure, Tim. Great to have you on board, Tim. To answer your question, yes. The quotas, the goals and all our budgets everything has been set. The anomaly happened during the first month of the fiscal year. So those are all set. In general, the good news about our business is, we see growth in all our major verticals. The gaming sector continues to focus more and more on non-gaming and they require more and more products that are well integrated with the rest of the systems they have and they’ve always done well in that sector and we see more and more opportunities there. Like I said in my prepared remarks, just in the last quarter alone, there are like five major operators, who switch from a computing system to us. So, we continue to see growth there. Hotel, resorts and cruises, what we call HRC, there are massive opportunities for us there. So, we do have extra focus in those areas now, especially in the cruise segment of that, there are multiple big cruise companies that are currently talking to us based on the recent successes we’ve had. And foodservice management also remains a major focus area because with what we have done there, with one major customer now we have opportunities with a couple of other major foodservice management providers and also, we are branching into market segments where we have typically not done well. So that’s a big focus area for us, getting into senior living, healthcare, higher education, sports and entertainment. So, we do have additional sales staff, who are focused on those areas and of course Asia and Europe remain huge opportunities for us. So, we have improved bulked up our sales support and sales staff there. In Europe, we are just in the process of expanding our sales team there and the same with Asia as well. So, you think of Asia, Europe and our three major verticals in the U.S., we see opportunities in all of those and we are continuing to expand our sales efforts in each of them. Now you switch to products. POS continues to be a scent area for us now. That’s where a bulk of our growth is happening and we are beginning to increase our focus in the PMS area as well. As the products are improving, as we have created more and more ancillary products that our customers have always wanted, where they would have, they like to get the core products and the ancillary products from one vendor, if they can help it, so PMS is a major product focus area for us.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. And then in your guidance, you mentioned some new products or areas, I believe golf and spas. Is there anything in the guidance that is coming from new products or the guidance predicated all on existing products? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: It’s a combination of the two, Tim. Our growth, our, the guidance we have provided is based on both. We do have a lot of strength with our core products now that have been established over many, number of years. And of course, the rGuest platform is continuing to gain strength with every passing month. So that is a big growth driver for us. And then a lot of these new additional modules that I mentioned they achieve two objectives they help us achieve two objectives. One, the revenue and book sales bookings we gain from those additional products increases, they also help us increase the sales of our core products, because a customer will prefer to buy the core product when you have these ancillary modules that also add value. So, I mean fortunately or unfortunately, the answer is all of the above. Our guidance is based on continued growth in all our core products and from our newer set of products.
Tim Klasell: Okay, good. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate the help.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Tim.
Tony Pritchett: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions in queue at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Ramesh Srinivasan for closing remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Liz. And does Allen have another question? No?
Tony Pritchett: I think Allen has.
Operator: We do have a follow-up question from the line of Allen Klee. Your line is now open.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, sure, Liz. Yes.
Allen Klee: Hi. It’s not that meaningful, but it’s something that stood out that I was just trying to understand. I noticed that your gross margins in the professional services segment improved pretty significantly in the quarter compared to where they’ve kind of averaged around and I was just wondering what was behind that and is that anything that to think about going forward?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Allen, we’ve talked about this a bit in the past. Professional services margins vary a decent amount depending on the mix of projects that we have going on in any given quarter. We continue to expect that our margins for professional services will be in the 20% range, sometimes it’s low-20s and sometimes it’s high-20s. It will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Likely next year that trend will continue to be comparable to what we saw in fiscal ‘19. So not great predictability there, but in the 20s, that’s what we expect to see.
Allen Klee: Okay. Thank you very much.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Allen.
Tony Pritchett: Thanks, Allen.
Operator: I’m showing no further questions in queue at this time.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Liz and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. Look forward to speaking with all of you again in a couple of months when we report our Q1 FY ‘20. Enjoy the summer and good luck with everything. Thank you.

Ramesh, please go ahead.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal year 2020 first quarter earnings call. Joining Dave and me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer.We completed another strong quarter highlighted by revenue of $38.4 million, a 12.9% increase over Q1 of last year with increases in all three of our revenue lines, recurring revenue, product revenue, and professional services, driven by sales growth across our verticals.This was our seventh consecutive sequential revenue increase, fifth consecutive record revenue, and fourth consecutive double-digit year-over-year revenue increase quarter. Recurring revenue was a record $20.1 million for the quarter, driven by a 24% year-over-year increase in subscription revenues.Our cash balance decreased by $3.5 million during Q1 fiscal 2020 which is typical for us. While our revenue is not cyclical, our cash collections tends to be cyclical, Q1 being the most pronounced of them with each subsequent quarter thereafter improving during the fiscal year. We continue to expect fiscal year 2020 to be overall a significantly better free cash flow year compared to fiscal 2019.As I get more deeply into my comments, I want to make it clear that, when we refer to sales, that encompasses everything, we have sold during a period, which we normally measure internally in terms of annual contract value.Revenue on the other hand, is driven by product shipped or in the case of recurring revenue what has already been implemented and refers to the amounts we have recognized as revenue during a period.Sales during a period contributes towards both, current and future revenue. That said, our strong sales momentum continues to drive good revenue growth. The last three quarters have been among our best ever in terms of sales.The year-over-year increase in sales this quarter was the highest percentage than the corresponding revenue increase, which augurs well for continued future revenue growth.We are particularly encouraged by the continued increases in sales across Asia, Europe and the domestic hotel resorts/cruises vertical and especially in the food service management vertical.During the past few months, we have made substantial sales progress with a second major food service provider. Within food service management, we are also seeing good traction in healthcare, senior living, stadium arenas and higher education subverticals.These subverticals have contributed minimally to our revenue profile in the past, in spite of their business requirements aligning quite well with our products and services. These verticals represent good new sales and revenue growth opportunities for us.We recently had good success, implementing POS, and kitchen video system automation in a major cruise ship. We were successful in automating dining operations on the ship, which were practically all pen and paper based before.This ship became our first customer, to have 100% flexible mobile tablets, with no fixed terminals across its numerous revenue centers. As a result of this implementation, their staff became significantly more mobile and could fill orders even while remaining at the guest's table, resulting in a significant increase in the speed of guest service.The success of this recent ship implementation is beginning to open new doors for us across the cruise industry. Given our normally strong presence in gaming casinos, this sales momentum in other verticals, is making our growth increasingly more broad-based.A significant portion of our current success is due to our continued focus, accountability and strategy between our sales efforts, across all verticals and regions. Our go to market strategies and execution, has become a lot more effective and are continuing to yield improved results.We recently formed a product strategy team, consisting of Agilysys hospitality industry veterans that is helping guide the development and rollout of our integrated product sets in a thoughtful and coordinated way, directed by our medium and long-term strategies.We also increased our global quota carrying sales team by approximately 10%, during the quarter. As an overall organization culturally, it is more prevalent with us now than ever before, that all of us work to support our sales teams and our customer facing personnel, including in services and support.That is true for me as well. Sales, services and customer support do not work for me. I work for sales services and support and through them for our customers. From a product set standpoint, while point of sale POS solutions, consisting of InfoGenesis POS, InfoGenesis Flex, rGuest Buy Kiosk and rGuest Buy On-Demand continue to be the main drivers of our current success.We are also making good progress with our property management systems, PMS, related product development initiatives both with respect to core products and with respect to innovations and software modules, surrounding the core product features.We are making good progress with the recently launched ancillary PMS modules, like one, rGuest Book, a booking engine which integrates directly with major property management systems and can enable full package booking including spa and golf appointments along with room bookings and upsell features based on the profile of each guest.Two, rGuest Express Mobile, a fully integrated check-in, check-out solution with digital ID verification, and digital key delivery. Three, rGuest Express Kiosk, a self-service check-in, check-out kiosk. And four, rGuest Service, a resort-wide customer service and task management module, also offering a staff communication platform designed to mobilize all internal paths and workflows utilizing variable technology.All these modules have been implemented in multiple locations and offer good value and return on investment for our customers. About 40 new sales agreements have been signed for these new emerging software modules during the past 12 months.The increasing sales pipeline we are beginning to see in property management systems, PMS gives us good reason to believe that our future growth will be driven in a more balanced manner across both POS and PMS solutions. PMS solutions were implemented in nearly 2,400 additional rooms during Q1 fiscal 2020 and we believe we can do much better in the future with this metric.With respect to our continuing momentum with POS solutions, the rGuest Buy guest facing kiosk solution has been a star performer for us during the past year, with rGuest Buy Kiosk installations more than doubling during the past 12 months from 266 to 676 endpoints.The rGuest Product Suite now represents 11% of total revenue in Q1 of fiscal 2020 compared to 8% during Q1 last fiscal year. We continue to increase our R&D spend without impacting profitability. The adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a record $3.2 million in spite of not having the benefit of capitalizing software development costs as was the case prior to Q2 of last year.Our R&D strength including personnel and technical services across the U.S. and India development center was 540 as of June 30, compared to around 230 2.5 years ago. We are improving our core products now at a faster rate than ever before and simultaneously increasing innovation within both our core products and complementary modules.The hospitality industry currently has a big need for modular and well integrated POS and PMS software solutions and even the biggest providers in the space are unable to deliver the kind of end-to-end solutions customers increasingly demand at the level we currently are able to provide. That gives us a significant competitive advantage in the hospitality industry, the only industry we are focused on. That will continue to drive topline revenue growth for us and we remain confident we can do so by also simultaneously growing profitability.On the international front, I recently returned from a two-week trip to Singapore and to our 400 plus strong India development center. We also held a successful EMEA customer summit in London during the quarter. It is exciting to see the extent of international revenue growth opportunities in front of us.Our revenue from international regions during Q1 of fiscal 2020 was an all-time record. This quarter also marked five consecutive quarters of increasing international revenue. Some of our recent international wins include the St. George's Hotel in London and the Angsana Teluk Bahang hotel in Pinang, Malaysia.During the past few quarters, we have made significant improvements in expanding SaaS development operations infrastructures partnerships in Netherlands, Singapore, China and Australia to accommodate our growing global SaaS implementation needs. During my recent visit to our India development center, it was exciting to see that rate at which various product improvements and innovation initiatives are getting done and the extraordinary work culture.In summary, we continue to see multiple avenues for sustainable growth that we can and I expect we will execute well on. We operate in the growing hospitality industry that is massive compared to our current modest annual revenue size. And it's an industry with an increasing need for a world-class technology-solutions provider who can provide end-to-end modular and well-integrated POS and PMS software solutions and a partner who continues to invest in people, products and customer service.I firmly believe that our future success continues to be entirely within our own control and as such we are about as well-insulated as is reasonable to expect from the ups and downs of the daily macro headlines, economic predictions, trade wars, interest rate fluctuations and virtually everything else we read and hear about every day.Given these characteristics, I remain optimistic about the investment case for Agilysys at the current share price level given the many opportunities we have in our hands to continue to grow shareholder value.I look forward to talking to all of you again about three months from now to report on the Q2 September quarter, which given our current sales momentum should be our sixth consecutive record revenue quarter.With that, let me hand the call over to our CFO, Tony Pritchett for more color on our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thanks, Ramesh. As Ramesh highlighted, we are pleased with the results for the fiscal 2020 first quarter. When we look back at the last 12 months to 18 months, we see clear and tangible proof of improvement in growth across just about every facet of our business.As we look ahead, we are very encouraged with the growth potential in the markets and remain confident in our ability to grow top-line and improve profitability and shareholder value.The results reflect the significant progress we are making on the operational side of the business including managing OpEx and CapEx spend in total so that it declines as a percentage of revenue while at the same time investing in the right areas of the company that will afford us the clearest and surest path to growth.Taking a look at our financial results beginning with our income statement first quarter fiscal 2020 revenue was $38.4 million, a 12.9% increase from total net revenue of $34 million in the prior year period. This marks our fifth consecutive record revenue quarter and the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.We are pleased to see growth across all three of our revenue line items and record revenue in two of these revenue lines. The increase in top-line largely reflects a 19.7% increase in product revenue to $10.9 million and a 12% increase in recurring revenue to a record $20.1 million as well as a 6.3% increase in professional services to a record $7.4 million.Total recurring revenue represented 52.3% of total net revenue for the fiscal first quarter compared to 52.7% of total net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. It is important to note that within that recurring revenue growth, we enjoyed robust subscription revenue growth which continues to outpace our overall revenue growth.Subscription revenue grew at 24% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Subscription revenue comprised approximately 35% of total recurring revenue compared to 32% of total recurring revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Both total recurring revenue and subscription revenue are good reference points regarding the health of the business.Going forward, we expect total recurring revenue to continue to grow and for subscription revenue growth to continue to outpace the rate of total recurring revenue growth and continue to grow faster than 20% for the balance of fiscal 2020.With regard to endpoints, we currently service approximately 273,000 rooms and have approximately 55,000 terminals reflecting an increase of 4% and 14%, respectively compared to Q1 of last year.Total gross profit of $20 million represents an 11.9% increase from $17.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit is mostly attributable to the growth in recurring revenue with minimal increases in associated cost of goods sold, resulting from the scalable nature of our existing infrastructure to support and host customers.Gross profit margin was 52.1% compared to 52.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Gross profit margin decreased 50 basis points, due primarily to a decrease in professional services gross profit margin from 29.8% in Q1 of fiscal 2019 to 25.1% in Q1 of fiscal 2020. As a reminder professional services margins vary greatly depending on the mix of projects that we are engaged in. And during the quarter just ended, we experienced an impact on margins due to our ramp in hiring to help manage our growing backlog of projects, resulting from our recent sales momentum.Having said that, we continue to expect that our margins for professional services will be in the mid to high-20% range as we get our new professional services personnel trained and deployed on customer projects. Gross profit margin for products was 20.7% compared to 21.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, while gross profit margin for recurring revenue was 79.2% compared to 77.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.Looking at operating expenses. Excluding charges for legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges, the first quarter saw a 12.3% increase in operating expenses to $21.3 million, compared to $19 million in the prior year period. As expected, this increase is attributable to the increase in product development expense which increased by $3 million or 42% compared to fiscal Q1 of last year, about 70% of which is due to the change in treatment of software development costs.As we have mentioned on prior calls, we instituted agile development and deployment practices across all of our products during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 that preclude us from capitalizing internal labor costs on the balance sheet. As a result, our product development expense line item on the income statement is significantly higher now than in prior years, since the cost that was previously removed from the P&L and capitalized software development costs and reflected on the balance sheet is now being reflected as an expense on the income statement.In the back of our press release, you will find a reconciliation of product development expense to include these amounts. As an effect of this change, our operating loss and net loss are higher this quarter than they would have been if we had capitalized labor. The development costs capitalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 of $2.1 million was a benefit to product development expense that did not recur in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.This also affects operating cash flows as wages and contract labor payments that were previously capitalized, now reflect as an operating cash output. The increase in product development expense was slightly offset by decreases in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense.Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $0.3 million or 5.4%, compared to fiscal Q1 of last year. And general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million or 2.2% compared to fiscal Q1 of last year, due to the timing of certain events that will occur later this fiscal year compared to last year.Looking at appreciation of fixed assets, we had a $0.4 million benefit in the fiscal 2020 first quarter that did not impact the fiscal 2019 first quarter and will not affect our ongoing depreciation expense in future quarters. This led to an operating loss of $1.5 million for the first quarter compared to an operating loss of $$1.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Net loss for the first quarter was $1.6 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to $1.7 million and $0.08 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2019, was $37.2 million compared to $40.8 million at March 31, 2019. You'll notice a large increase in long-term assets as well as to short-term and long-term liabilities. We recorded a right of use asset of $13.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $15.7 million, split between current and long-term liabilities. These balances are the result of our implementation of ASC 842, a new lease accounting standard that became effective for us in the quarter. This new accounting standard requires companies to record liabilities, which were previously off balance sheet obligations and the associated assets onto the balance sheet. For us, there is no impact to the income statement classification of rent expense or depreciation expense.As we have previously stated, we expect the first half of the fiscal year to pose a drag on cash, especially during the first fiscal quarter, when we pay our annual bonuses, which will then be more than offset in the second half of the fiscal year.As it relates to our cash flow, we reported an increase in net cash used by operating activities, which rose from $1.4 million to $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and which included the headwind of previously capitalized engineering costs not reflected in operating cash flows.Free cash flow, however, which is a more comparable metric since it includes the software development costs in both periods, improved by 41% compared to last year from a $4.2 million outflow last year to a $2.5 million outflow this year.For the fiscal 2020 first quarter, adjusted EBITDA was a record $3.2 million compared to $3.1 million in the year ago quarter. However, assuming no software development costs were capitalized in the fiscal 2019 first quarter, adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2019 first quarter would have been around $1 million or over $2 million less than the current year.Regarding our NOLs, we continue to carry approximately $210 million of NOL carry forwards with the full valuation analysis on our books that will enable us to remain libel for taxes only in certain foreign jurisdictions as well as minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our current NOLs that expire do so between fiscal years 2031 and 2038.Finally, taking a look at our guidance, this afternoon we reiterated our forecast for fiscal 2020 full year revenue growth of approximately 11% compared to fiscal 2019 revenue of approximately $141 million, and expect to record an approximate 25% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $10 million.We also expect fiscal 2020 free cash flow will be significantly more than the $1.7 million of free cash flow generated in fiscal 2019.In closing, we are pleased with the start to the year and with the improvements across our business, particularly around our ability to grow the top line, including recurring revenue. We are pleased with the consistent progress we are making as we prudently manage working capital, so that going forward we can further optimize operating cash flows and continue to strategically leverage our healthy balance sheet.With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Katherine?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Allen Klee with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: Yes. Good afternoon. Your results topped my expectations. I was just curious if there was anything that you would point out that might have been one-time in nature in this quarter that I should think about?
Tony Pritchett: Hey, Allen, this is Tony. Thanks for listening in today and continuing to follow the stock. As far as one-time items ago we mentioned the depreciation expense, which is not even part of EBITDA. But that depreciation expense item was a non-recurring item.Otherwise things were generally consistent this quarter. Nothing unusually outside the norm from a revenue perspective. There was nothing material. That was a one-time item. You know from time-to-time, we do have operating expenses that hit us in different quarters of the year. So, for example, we had some trade shows and events that hit us in Q1 of last year that don't come in until later this year. So there is some lumpiness in OpEx. But from a general business perspective, ongoing operations there was nothing materially unusual in the quarter.
Allen Klee: Okay. Great. And then in terms of the Indian development center, and I think I heard you say around 400 people in it now. Can you help us think about like the cost of -- that you're spending like the run rate of building that out? And is there a sense of like that to any degree that that's like will normalize in a certain time period?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. Hi, Allen. This is Ramesh. So as far as the CapEx is involved, the CapEx is already done. Those costs have been incurred and we have built out the facility to accommodate about 660 to 670 people. And in my prepared remarks I told you it's 400 plus. It is well north of 400 now.And in terms of how you model the cost, I would think of R&D as a whole as an entirety, Allen. And R&D as a percentage of revenue will remain stable may tick up a point or two this year. But in general over the medium-term, R&D as a percentage of revenue will keep going down. Meaning, we will grow revenue at a faster rate than we grew R&D this fiscal year. This fiscal year you may see a one or two point tick up in R&D. So the IDC and how we manage the U.S. development centers gives us a way to manage R&D in a responsible and prudent way is the way I would think about it.
Allen Klee: Okay. Thank you so much. Maybe my last question would just be if you could comment on the competitive environment if you're seeing anything new or different in terms of the level or products and pricing and that type of stuff.
Ramesh Srinivasan: No major change Allen in the competitive environment. We feel in many areas our competitive advantage is increasing mainly because of two reasons. I think we are investing in our core products more than what the competition is I suspect. And also in terms of also investing in the ancillary modules, that is the software modules that surround the core POS and PMS products, we are investing more in that than I suspect the competition is.So in terms of the end-to-end solutions we are able to provide both on the POS side and the PMS side, I can see raised eyebrows with our prospect to the customers. They're appreciating it more and more. So I think we are working hard to increase our competitive advantage. Nothing major has changed in the competitive environment in terms of pricing or anything else, but I would say on the other side of the ledger, the PMS competition is improving.I think PMS products in general are improving in the industry, which is good for the industry. And also POS competition in APAC in Asia is getting better is increasing. So we are doubling our efforts in APAC to make sure we compete well. But the fact that one or two vendors are doing well here and there should not bother us, because it's a massive industry compared to our size. And we remain very confident about our sales and revenue growth prospects.
Allen Klee: Okay. Thank you so much.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks Allen.
Tony Pritchett: Thanks Allen.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tim Klasell with Northland Capital. Your line is open.
Tyler Wood: Hi. This is Tyler Wood on for Tim. Thanks for taking our question. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you saw in terms of customer retention for the customer? Obviously, we've been seeing it steadily pick up under the new management. Are we kind of seeing that flatten out a bit now or how much more room for improvement, do you see there?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. Hi Tyler, thanks for joining the call. The measure customer retention as a percentage of recurring revenue and that is continuing to do better. That is continuing to do better than the past.So this fiscal year 2020, in percentage terms, in terms of customer retention as a percentage of recurring revenue should improve over previous years. And we have room to improve there.We have room to number one grow the denominator. Number one grow recurring revenue which is steadily occurring. And we also have room to improve customer retention.So in percentage terms, we are doing better year after year, for the past two or three years. That will continue to improve. But we do have room to improve there. Right we are working hard to make that even better Tyler.
Tyler Wood: One more, as we look at the international opportunity growing, could you talk a little bit about maybe how the international buyers differ from domestically? You know are they taking on-premise versus hosted more or are there certain modules that you're seeing resonate internationally?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. So, when you think of international regions Tyler, what you need to keep in mind is our market share there is very low, right. In the past, since we didn't do a great job. We did not do a great job with international regions, our market share there is extremely low.So, there are massive opportunities to improve there to grow our revenue, which is why we've had like five consecutive quarters of revenue growth in international regions.It tends to be a reasonable mix of on-prem and SaaS, like it is here. If anything it's probably a little bit more on-prem oriented than SaaS as things stand now, especially in APAC.And our standing in both Europe and Asia is improving, because more and more customers are taking notice of the improvements we have made in the last two years.So, international regions is just a matter of making sure we improve our products, we provide the kind of functionality features, that our international customers require. We provide the kind of language translations and localization in our product that we require. And since all that is improving now, they are taking more and more notice of us.
Tyler Wood: All right congrats on the performance.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Tyler. I appreciate it.
Dave Wood: Thanks, Tyler.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Ramesh, for any closing comments.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Katherine. To conclude we had a solid start to fiscal 2020. We continue to focus on maintaining our operational discipline, while pursuing the highest value growth opportunities.We continue to make progress in evolving our solutions portfolio to better address our customer needs, transform our sales efforts and improve our organization to better complement our solutions. And generally improve how we serve our customers.We remain confident that we will continue to make consistent progress. We will see added growth. And will increase shareholder value in continuing future periods. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.";[-0.016399846399229756, 0.0415348509630149];0.0415348509630149;-0.016399846399229756;0

Ramesh, please go ahead.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you Dave and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our CFO.We are pleased to report that we completed yet another strong quarter, highlighted by revenue of $40.7 million, a 19% increase over Q2 of last year, with increases across all three of our revenue lines: recurring revenue, product revenue and in particular, professional services revenue.Professional services revenue is directly proportional to the number of software implementations we are involved in. It is therefore a good indicator of our current level of overall selling success and business activity. The fact that this was a record professional services revenue quarter exceeding the $8 million mark for the first time, all that is well for future recurring revenue growth, especially subscription revenue growth given a majority of the installs we are currently working on are subscription revenue related. Recurring revenue was a record $20.3 million, driven by a 16% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue.Regarding overall quarterly revenue, this quarter marked the eighth consecutive sequential revenue increase, sixth consecutive record revenue and fifth consecutive double-digit year-over-year revenue increase. Fiscal 2020 second quarter was also a record quarter in terms of value of major competitive replacements won. In summary, we are improving with respect to almost all business indicators every quarter.In addition, our cash balance increased by $1.7 million during fiscal 2020 second quarter, a significant improvement over the $2.2 million cash loss during the same period last year. The cash balance at the end of fiscal 2020 second quarter is about $6 million higher compared to the end of the second quarter last year. That is our largest year-over-year cash balance increase during a 12-month period since Q1 of fiscal 2015, which was only better due to the effect of the sale of the Retail Solutions Group.We continue to expect fiscal 2020 to be a significantly better free cash flow positive year compared to fiscal 2019. We remain committed to both, being disciplined in driving revenue growth in a profitable manner, and supporting strategic investments that will help drive profitable revenue growth.In terms of selling success, fiscal 2020 second quarter was our second best quarter ever. In fact, the past recent four quarters have been four of our five best quarters since we transformed to a pure play hospitality software solutions company in fiscal 2014. Our best quarter ever was back in fiscal 2016, and included a major hardware refresh project that skewed the number upwards.So in terms of consistent successful sales activity, this trailing 12-month period is a new high mark for us. In addition, our last five quarters are all record quarters for close deals involving software subscription services. We are confident the year-over-year growth in quarterly subscription revenue will remain in the 20’s in percentage terms for the full fiscal year 2020, and during most quarters for the foreseeable future.Our selling and revenue momentum are not only at record levels now, but just as important are also much more broad-based than before, providing us with added future growth areas and further diversifying and de-risking our revenue streams.Our strong presence in the gaming and casinos vertical continues to expand as evidenced by our growing partnership with Choctaw Casinos and Resorts, well known for the top-rated casinos and the AAA Four-Diamond hotel in Durant, Oklahoma.During Q2 Choctaw selected our PMS property management system suite of products, including subscription based versions of LMS, rGuest Book and rGuest Express Mobile for all three of their hotel properties in Oklahoma. Another well-known regional gaming operator, Maverick Gaming, joined our family of customers during Q2, purchasing subscription based versions of InfoGenesis, InfoGenesis Flex and rGuest Pay for their properties in Nevada, Colorado and Washington State.Outside of gaming, we are particularly encouraged by our increased selling momentum across the hotels, resorts and cruise ships vertical. We expanded our partnership this quarter with The Kessler Collection Hotel Group who purchased InfoGenesis, rGuest Pay and rGuest Analyze, all subscription based for a few of their properties, including for the Beaver Creek Lodge, a Marriott Autograph Collection, ski-in / ski-out hotel in Colorado.Also, in the hotels resorts category, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Teton Village, Wyoming purchased subscription based versions of InfoGenesis, InfoGenesis Flex, rGuest Pay and rGuest Seat for all their on-mountain ski resort fine dining and quick serve restaurants.In the cruise vertical we expanded our partnership with Carnival UK during the quarter. Carnival UK is now looking to expand their deployment of InfoGenesis and InfoGenesis Flex onto their 5,200 passenger cruise ship, Iona, the biggest ever ship purpose built for the UK market that will launch in May 2020. This will be our second ship with Carnival UK after the successful pilot on their 3,000 plus passenger Grand class cruise ship, Ventura. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with Carnival UK, supporting their food and beverage point of sale needs.In the foodservice management vertical we continue to expand our existing relationships and add new customer sites. We closed sale agreements and implemented our point of sale software at several outlets in multiple major airports during the quarter, leveraging a relatively new customer relationship that has evolved quickly over the last few quarters, as we continue to successfully install and support software in these high-volume, quick-turn food and beverage locations.Outside of these customer segments that represent the majority of our current revenue, we also recently closed a major new logo stadium sales agreement in the sports and entertainment vertical. Within the foodservice management vertical, we also continued to make good progress in the areas of healthcare, senior living and higher education.Another recent new logo win in a sector in which we have had no other installations before is Virgin Trains USA, the only privately owned and operated intercity passenger railroad in the United States. Virgin Trains purchased InfoGenesis, rGuest Buy Kiosk, rGuest Buy Mobile, rGuest Pay, Eatec and rGuest Analyze, all subscription based for one of their trains between Miami and West Palm Beach. These are just a few notable examples of the recent success we’ve had winning new customers and new kinds of customers, while expanding our partnerships with current customers.During our fiscal 2020 first quarter call in May earlier this year, we guided that the full year fiscal 2020 revenue would be about 11% higher than the full year fiscal 2019 revenue level of about $141 million. Given our increased business momentum, we feel it prudent now to increase that revenue growth guidance to 14% for the full year fiscal 2020.We continue to make good progress with our product development initiatives with respect to property management systems, PMS and related additional software modules, and also recently announced a major PMS win against stiff competition. However, our revenue growth continues to be largely dependent on point-of-sale, POS, side of our business.Alongside our star performer InfoGenesis, rGuest Buy continues to build good momentum in the marketplace, with increasing instances of rGuest Buy replacing competitor systems in cafeterias, in multiple large prestigious campuses, all across the U.S. While POS by itself is good enough to keep driving our revenue and profitability levels forward at a significant pace, we are steadily reaching the stage where our growth will be driven by both major product segments, point-of-sale and property management systems.The hospitality industry is in need of a world-class PMS technology provider who can create value by improving guest experience and increasing guest loyalty with well-integrated solutions that are able to incorporate modules like direct channel web booking systems, mobile check-in / check-out, kiosk check-in / check-out and service optimization, to better manage tasks and operations across an increased number of property initiatives. We now have multiple examples of customers who have implemented such additional value-adding software modules offered by us around our PMS offers.Given the demand we see in the market, we will be bringing to market an additional software module called the Agilysys Customer Engagement Suite during fiscal Q3. This module will serve as a launching pad for our proprietary offering that will provide customers the platform for loyalty programs, stored value, gift card and meal card type applications. We are excited to be one of the very few hospitality solution providers to be focused on developing and offering fully integrated guest self-service solutions.Encouraged by our successes during the past couple of years, we continue to increase our R&D resources and continue to do so without significantly increasing R&D costs as a percentage of revenue to ensure we drive our increasing competitive advantage in top line growth down to increasing profitability levels. Our R&D teams, including technical services are currently about 650 people strong compared to approximately 230 at the beginning of calendar 2017. This increase has afforded us the ability to strengthen and modernize our core products more quickly and effectively, while also increasing innovation levels.We recently leased additional space at our India Development Center and we’ll staff it in line with how our business momentum continues to evolve. In addition, we continue to increase our R&D resources and capabilities in the U.S. in addition to increasing our SaaS operation support, professional services, technical services and customer support, U.S. based staff.In summary, we are operating in an industry with the total addressable market, which is a couple of orders of magnitude larger than our current relatively modest annual revenue size, providing us with ample runway for growth.The hospitality industry continues to grow. Our customers have an increasing need for the products and solutions we provide. The success we are seeing across our business is not only improving and growing, but also doing so consistently. Our continuing success is well grounded on the stable foundation we have built over the past few years.Possible downward macroeconomic dips, if and when they happen, tend to actually increase the need for software solutions like ours, which help improve operational efficiencies and attract and manage guests better. During challenging economic times there is often an increased need for tools to attract and retain guests.We look forward to talking to all of you again in about three months from now to report on the December ending Q3 fiscal 2020 quarter, which given our current selling momentum should be our seventh consecutive record revenue quarter.With that, let me hand the call over to our CFO, Tony Pritchett, for more color on our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thanks Ramesh. We are pleased with the results for the fiscal 2020 second quarter both as it relates to the quarter itself, as well as with the trend that the results show. We continue to see improvements across many facets of the business and in our financial results that reflect the success we are achieving. We are confident the success will continue.Looking at our financial results, second quarter of fiscal 2020 revenue was a record $40.7 million or 19% higher than total net revenue of $34.2 million in the prior year period. As Ramesh highlighted, this represents our eighth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth, our sixth consecutive quarter of record revenue and our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit year-over-year revenue improvement.We are pleased to see that growth came from all three of our revenue line items, including record revenue across support, maintenance and subscription services revenue, as well as for professional services revenue. The increase in our top line was driven by a 35.4% increase in product revenue to $11.9 million, a 7.8% increase in recurring revenue to a record $20.3 million and a 29.5% increase in professional services revenue to a record $8.5 million.I want to highlight that the 7.8% recurring revenue growth includes subscription revenue growth of 16% for the quarter. Subscription revenue comprised approximately 36.1% of total recurring revenue, compared to 33.6% of total recurring revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.Total recurring revenue represented 49.9% of total net revenue for the fiscal second quarter compared to 55.1% of total net revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. It’s important to keep in mind that the strong selling momentum we have generated which Ramesh discussed earlier, is not only driving our product and professional services revenue growth but also have a high correlation to future performance for our total recurring and subscription revenue growth. As such, this trend provides us with added confidence that both total recurring and subscription revenues will see increased growth in future quarters.Following our comments from our Q1 call, we continue to expect total recurring revenue to grow, and for subscription revenue growth to outpace the rate of total recurring revenue growth, and we continue to expect subscription revenue to grow faster than 20% for the entire year as we have discussed previously.With regard to endpoints, we currently service approximately 274,000 rooms and have approximately 57,000 terminals, reflecting an increase of 2% and 12% respectively, compared to Q2 of last year.Moving down the income statement, total gross profit was $20.2 million, representing a 13.9% increase from $17.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit is the result of growth across our three revenue line items.Gross profit margin was 49.6% compared to 51.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Total gross profit margin is down slightly compared to last year, due to the acceleration of selling momentum as mentioned earlier, which results in converting products and professional services contracts to revenue in the near term. This should lead to better than originally expected recurring revenue growth rates in the coming quarters.We have also hired some additional people for our support team, as well as adding some people and infrastructure around our SaaS operations, which puts temporary pressure on our recurring gross profit margins. One important fact to note is that even though total gross profit margins are down compared to last year, gross profit margins for product and professional services are both up compared to last year and we continue to expect on an annual basis for total gross profit margins to expand slightly from last year.Moving on to operating expenses, excluding charges for legal settlements and restructuring, severance and other charges, the second quarter saw 9.3% increase in operating expenses to $23 million compared to $21.1 million in the prior year period. This increase is in line with our operating plan to increase cost at a slower pace than we increase revenue.Combined our three main operating expense line items, product development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses were 53% of revenue this quarter compared to 58% of revenue during Q2 of fiscal 2019, and the increase in those same operating expense lines combined was only 10% while revenue increased 19%.There is still much work to be done and many more opportunities to grow. As such, and as Ramesh pointed out, we will continue to invest in the business, including in R&D, SaaS operations, customer services and support, while maintaining our focus to increase the cost well below the pace of revenue growth.Operating loss of $2.9 million for the second quarter is an improvement compared to an operating loss of $3.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and net loss for the second quarter was $2.9 million or $0.13 per diluted share, favorably comparing to a loss of $3.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.Moving to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2019 was $38.9 million compared to $40.8 million at March 31, 2019, and compared to $32.9 million at September 30, 2018. As we previously stated, we expected the first half of the fiscal year to pose a drag on cash due to the timing of collections, as well as the payment of annual bonuses. This loss will be offset in the second half of the fiscal year.One important fact to note, during the previous five second quarters, we have lost several million dollars of cash or more. This is the first time since July 2013 when we sold the Retail Solutions Group and received the cash for that transaction, that we have increased our cash balance during the second fiscal quarter of the year.During the fiscal 2020 first quarter, we recorded a right of use asset of $13.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $15.7 million, split between current and long-term liabilities. These balances are the result of our implementation of ASC 842, the new lease accounting standard that became effective for us in the first quarter of this fiscal year. This new accounting standard requires companies to record liabilities, which were previously off-balance sheet obligations and the associated assets onto the balance sheet. There is no impact to the income statement classification of rent expense or depreciation expense for us.As it relates to our cash flow, we reported net cash provided by operating activities of $3.1 million compared to $1.4 million of net cash used for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Free cash flow also showed a significant improvement from an outflow of $2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to an inflow of $1.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Through the first six months of fiscal 2020, free cash flow has improved by approximately $5.5 million compared to the first half of fiscal 2019.For the fiscal 2020 second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $3 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million in the year ago quarter. We continue to carry approximately $218 million of NOL carry-forwards with a full valuation allowance on our books that will enable us to remain liable for taxes only in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our NOLs will expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2038.As it relates to our guidance, given the continued improvement across our business, we are confident in raising our guidance for fiscal 2020 year-over-year revenue growth from 11% to 14% compared to full year fiscal 2019 revenue of approximately $141 million. We continue to expect an approximate 25% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $10 million.The reason we are not raising adjusted EBITDA guidance is that given the increased business momentum we are currently enjoying in the global hospitality marketplace, we have made the decision to slightly increase our investments in SaaS operations, in preparation for future increases in subscription based services, as well as in R&D professional services and customer support resources. Please keep in mind that fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million had the benefit of about $2.2 million of capitalized software costs, which did not occur in fiscal 2020.Growing adjusted EBITDA by 25% between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 is actually the equivalent of growing adjusted EBITDA by 60% if we remove the $2.2 million capitalization benefit in the prior year.Growing revenue by 14% and adjusted EBITDA by around 60% after normalizing for software development capitalization costs reflects the significant operating leverage we continue to work with as we manage expense-related investments carefully to continue to support future profitable revenue growth. And regarding free cash flow, we continue to expect fiscal 2020 free cash flow will be significantly more than the $1.7 million of free cash flow generated in fiscal 2019.In closing, our business is improving as reflected in the consistent progress across multiple quarters and we are confident that we’ll continue to do so. We have spent much of the past couple of years working toward building a company to deliver world-class solutions and service that is second to none, and we hope you can see the results of our efforts coming through in our financial results.We’ve been laser-focused on improving this company and the great set of products we have and feel our efforts are beginning to pay off. Going forward, we will continue to stay focused, work hard and work every day toward making our hospitality industry customers happy and successful.With that, I’d now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Sarah?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Wood with Northland Securities. Your line is now open.
Tyler Wood: Hey, I’ll ask a question on the gaming side of the business. How big do you think the opportunity is there outside of Las Vegas and how are you approaching that market differently, and how far along are those customers been – their transformation to – what were they using previously? Is it a competitive displacement or were they using something homegrown? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah, hi Tyler. So the opportunity in gaming continues to be good for us and its good both in Las Vegas and outside, and a good portion of the opportunity is outside Las Vegas. So we generally do well in gaming – in the gaming casino industry and that is true for both, within Las Vegas and outside Las Vegas, and a significant portion of the opportunity is outside Las Vegas as well.And the two things, the two reasons why our gaming business will continue to improve: number one, all the customers in general are relatively more focused on the non-gaming hospitality side of their business and that gradually continues to improve. They are more and more focused on the hospitality non-gaming part of the business. And in terms of competitor systems there, most of the competitive replacements we do there are of a couple of major competitors. That space has been dominated by a couple of major competitors and most of the replacements we do are switches from those major competitors.
Tyler Wood: Thank you, that’s helpful. And one more, any progress during the quarter on the international opportunity worth mentioning, and then could you just remind us what sales resources do you have internationally? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah, thanks Tyler. Yeah, the international opportunities continue to make good progress and like I described in the earnings call, the major cruise ship customer that we are beginning to make great progress with is an international customer, and we are also making good progress with a major hotel chain that is our customer, both domestic and in international.And outside of these two major customers we continue to make good progress in both the APAC region and the EMEA region and we do have future plans to look at Mexico, and the rest of Latin America as well. So international is going to be a major growth area for us. And the number of salespeople there, I don’t know the exact number Tyler, but it is sufficient to cover the area. And we are always open to increasing our sales staff as the market demands.So currently we are more focused on sales productivity. We are giving them more products to sell and as and when it is required, we will increase our sales staff there, but currently our coverage is very good, both APAC and EMEA.
Tyler Wood: Alright, thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks Tyler.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Allen Klee with National Securities. Your line is now open.
Allen Klee: Yes, hi. Can you just give us an update on the – and I apologize if you mentioned this and I missed it, the Indian Development Center in terms of number of people and the products and modules and things that are getting added from there? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah, hi Allen. Thank you for the question. Our India Development Center, IDC, our original capacity for a number of sources was about 670 or so and so far we have about 570 resources there.
Allen Klee: Do you have a sense of where you want that to be kind of percentage wise by the end of the year and…
Ramesh Srinivasan: Are you talking to us, Allen? Hi, Allen. Yeah, so as far as India Development Center is concerned, our capacity is about 670 and we have about 570 resources and we continue to hire there, and recently we have taken up, we have leased some extra space at our IDC as well.Now in terms of products and modules, all our products, all our modules are developed across U.S. and India. So we don’t have any demarcation of certain modules and products that are done in the U.S. and certain that are done in India. All our products have teams both in the U.S. and in India. So everything that we described in our call so far is done both in the U.S. and in India.You said something else like the – grew organic growth in light of the legacy business was and if we could think about what series this was, if it was last year for both of them?
Allen Klee: You said something else like the – grew organic growth in light of the legacy business was and if we could think about what series this was, if it was last year for both of them?Okay, thank you very much.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks Allen.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ramesh for closing remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Sarah. Thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your continued interest and support. Agilysys continues to be well positioned to increase shareholder value. There is a great value creation opportunity we are determined to make good on for our employees, customers and shareholders.I want to also take this opportunity to give a special thanks to our 1,000 plus team members across the globe, who are working hard every day to make Agilysys a world-class company, and to our customers who trust us with their investments now more than ever before.Our best wishes to all for a joyful and safe holiday season. We look forward to our next earnings call in late January. Talk to you then. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.";[0.279024013977315, 0.04094073752013494];0.04094073752013494;0.279024013977315;1
46;AGYS;2020-01-29;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Agilysys Fiscal 2020 Third Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Wood, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations at Agilysys. You may begin.
Dave Wood: Thank you, Sheri, and good afternoon everybody. Thank you for joining the Agilysys' fiscal 2020 third quarter conference call. We will get started in just a minute with management's comments. But before doing so, let me read the safe harbor language.Some statements made on today's call will be predictive and are intended to be made as forward-looking within the second half provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including statements regarding our financial guidance and continued business momentum. Although, the Company believes its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially.

Ramesh, please go ahead.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings call. Joining Dave and me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our CFO.We're pleased to report that we completed yet another strong quarter, highlighted by revenue of $42 million, a 17% increase over Q3 of last year with record revenue across all three received lines, recurring revenue, product revenue and professional services revenue. With respect of overall quarterly revenue, this is the ninth consecutive sequential revenue increase, seventh consecutive record revenue, and sixth consecutive double-digit year-over-year revenue increase quarter.Recurring revenue was a $21 million, led by a 28% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. Our customer's satisfaction levels continue to improve. As a result, customer churn as a percentage of recurring revenue continues to decline significantly year-over-year as of being the case the past couple of years. That improving metric continues to validate our organizational improvement across all aspects of our business especially in product development, professional services and customer support.Professional services revenue for Q3 fiscal 2020 was a record $8.9 million. This was our second consecutive record revenue quarter in professional services. As we mentioned in our last call, professional services is a good measure of how busy we are with various software implementations all across the globe and is therefore a good leading indicative of the overall strength of our business, especially our future growth of recurring revenue. Due to changing customer preferences, an increasing number of new customer software implementations involve subscription revenue arrangements.Our selling momentum continues to be strong with our global selling success in Q3 fiscal 2020 being one of our best ever. Please note, we used the word sales, selling and bookings to mean new product and services sale arrangements with customers, while revenue is of course recognized revenue. In many other places, the word sales and revenue tend to be used interchangeably, while it means different things for us. For us, sales this quarter will partially effect the current quarter revenue and also contribute towards building future recurring revenue, product revenue and services revenue backlog.With the exception of one quarter, way back in fiscal 2016 which contained a couple of significant deals. The last five quarters have been our five best selling quarters ever. This has helped build our revenue backlog significantly, making our revenue growth increasingly more consistent and predictable. In addition, the last six quarter through Q3 of this fiscal year have been our sixth best subscription booking quarters on record, which offers well for our continued subscription revenue growth.During Q3 fiscal 2020, we added 18 new customers to our family. Our international momentum continues to grow. Q3 this fiscal year was a record sales quarter for us in the APAC region and was our second best overall international sales quarter. To a large extent, our current sales and revenue growth is still being led by our market leading point-of-sale, POS solutions, InfoGenesis and ‎rGuest Buy Kiosk.Alongside, our star performer InfoGenesis which for the most part handles POS staff facing software solutions, rGuest Buy Kiosk which handle the growing demand for guest facing kiosks and other functionality requirements continues to build momentum in the market place with increasing instances of competitive systems being replaced in employee cafeterias in multiple, large and prestigious workplace campuses all across the U.S.While our POS solutions by themselves are good enough to drive our revenue and profitability level further forward at a significant pace for the foreseeable future, we continue to improve our property management systems, PMS offerings. Several of our new logo wins during Q3 fiscal 2020 included PMS software solutions as well. We've also had good success during the past couple of years, building a set of emerging products, which are ancillary software modules which work in conjunction with and add strength to the core POS and PMS products.Especially on the PMS side of equation, there is a major industry need for well integrated solutions which can bring together the world of core PMS with modules like direct channel web based booking systems, mobile check in, check out, kiosk check in, check out, guest loyalty management, service optimization to better manage various hospitality tasks and operations, and spa, golf and other guest activities management software.We have several customers sites as already implemented such modules integrated with the core PMS products also provided by us, resulting in significant improvements in operational efficiency, guest experience and guest satisfaction. While there are many completing POS vendors in the marketplace today, there are far fewer major PMS providers. And a number of providers who are actually trying to create a fully integrated model of PMS ancillary module is even fewer.Customers are increasingly inclined to use as few vendors as possible to get such integrated software solutions from and that's a trend which is favorable to our product and strategy direction. We have now sold close to 100 deals containing a huge one of these emerging product modules with about half of them coming just in the past six months.Thanks to these additional software products, our average deal size is increasing and more crucial than that our competitive advantage is increasing with no comparable competing vendors as intensely focused as we are in providing end to end software solutions and delivering a fully integrated technology platform to serve the full breadth of hospitality operators and their evolving guests engagement ecosystem.Customers in the industry have starved for such progress and are steadily rewarding us for being the partner they can depend on for both day to day rate execution and industry leading innovation. With respect to U.S. domestic markets during Q3 fiscal 2020 in the gaming vertical, Fortune Bay Resort Casino located in Minnesota, and the Grand River Casino & Resort located in South Dakota invested in both our PMS and POS solutions, along with a couple of other software models, while the Sky Dancer Casino & Resort recently purchased our rGuest Stay PMS solution to run their lodging operations.In addition, we significantly expanded our POS business partnership with one of our largest gaming customers during the quarter. In addition to our historical strength in the gaming, hotel resorts and cruises, and traditional managed food service verticals, during the last couple of quarters, we've also made good breakthroughs into renewed areas of focus in managed food service, higher education and healthcare.During Q3 fiscal 2020, we had new customer wins in the segment including Longwood University, Virginia, and another health care facility in Texas. Backed by a stable management team with senior executives, who have all been with us for a while now, all of them wonderful team players who are passionate about the Company and the huge potential we have before us. We continue to make good progress with all the business initiatives we started on a couple three years ago.We started this fiscal year with annual revenue guidance of 11% growth over the prior year, $141 million level then increased it during our last call to 14%, which we now are increasing to 16%. We continue to expect this significant revenue growth to also be accompanied by a strong adjusted EBITDA profitability year-over-year growth of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA for Q3 fiscal 2020 was $3.2 million, which is close to record levels.Encouraged by our successes during the past couple of years, we continue to increase our R&D resource strength to drive home our widening competitive advantage without any significant increase in R&D costs as a percentage of revenue. Our R&D teams are currently about 730 personnel strong compared to about 230 at the beginning of calendar 2017.This increase has afforded us the ability to strengthen and modernize our core products quicker and more effectively, while also increasing innovation levels, creating well integrated, additional high value software models, which face much less competition in the marketplace, and it's helping us focus on our long-term, top-line and bottom-line growth strategies.In summary, they are hitting our stride operationally as a small company with a big realistic vision and the resources necessary to execute and innovate consistently well. We understand well the nuances and operational realities of discipline profitable revenue growth. There is a high demand in the growing hospitality industry, we are currently and intensely focused on for the kind of integrated software solutions, we continue to create and enhance.We are beginning to see the results of having a solid good team in place, which is well positioned to significantly outperform the competition with great innovation. We look forward to talking to all of you again in about four months from now, when we will be reporting our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and in the fiscal year.With that, let me have over the call to our CFO, Tony Pritchett for more colors on our financial results and future outlook. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thanks Ramesh. We're happy that our business momentum continued into the fiscal 2020 third quarter. We're hitting our stride with respect to the plan was set out on three years ago, obtaining this company into a consistently profitable top-line growth company. The fact that this quarter was our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth with strong adjusted EBITDA to back it up is solid evidence of that. We are focused on delivering the best most reliable products to our customers and supporting our customers ever changing business needs, and we are confident that this will continue to drive our success.Looking at our financial results, third quarter fiscal 2020 revenue was a record $42 million, or 17% higher than total net revenue of $36 million in the prior year period. This quarter's $42 million in revenue is made up of record revenue in all three revenue categories of our income statement the fact that we're understandably proud of. The increase in our top-line was driven by an 18.5% increase in product revenue to $12.1 million, and 8.4% increase in recurring revenue to $21 million, and a 38.2% increase in professional services revenue to $8.9 million.I want to highlight that the 8.4% recurring revenue growth includes subscription revenue growth of 28% for the quarter. Subscription revenue comprised approximately 38% of total recurring revenue, compared to 32% of total recurring revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Total recurring revenue represented 49.9% of total net revenue for the fiscal third quarter, compared to 53.7% of total net revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.It is important to keep in mind that this dropped in recurring revenue as a percent of total revenue is not a negative fact for our business. This is a representation of strong business momentum and selling success. Our product revenue remains consistently strong, growing sequentially, as well as year-over-year. And increasing professional services revenue is a leading indicator of future growth for our total recurring and subscription revenue.We continue to build the subscription revenue growth rates on an annual basis will remain above 20%. The trailing 12-month growth rate is just over 22%. With regard to endpoints, we currently service approximately 274,000 rooms and approximately 61,000 point-of-sale endpoints, reflecting an increase of 1% and 15% respectively, compared to Q3 of last year.Moving down the income statement, total gross profit was $21.1 million, representing a 13% increase from $18.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit is the results of growth across our three revenue line items. Gross profit margin was 50.2% compare to 51.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.Total gross profit margin is down slightly compared to last year due to the acceleration of selling momentum, as mentioned earlier, which results in converting product and professional services contracts to revenue in the near-term. As indicated by our increased top line guidance from 14% to 16%, total revenue is a little better than expected this year.This acceleration of revenue growth starts with product and professional services revenue is that is the flow of revenue with our deals. Product revenue is recognized first shortly after contract signature. Professional services revenue is next, as we implement the systems we now deliver, and then recurring revenue begins.As our selling momentum continues and with revenue growing faster than expected, our gross profit margins are going to be less than plans since product revenue and professional services revenue had lower margins then our consolidated results. As such, we announced that gross profit margins for fiscal 2020 to be slightly less than those of fiscal 2019.Moving on operating expenses, excluding charges for legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges, the third quarter was a 5.7% increase in operating expenses to $23.7 million that compares to $22.5 million in the prior year period. This increase is in-line with our operating plan to increase costs at a slower pace than we increase revenue.Combined our three main operating expense line items, product development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses were 53% of revenue this quarter, compared to 59% of revenue during Q3 of this fiscal 2019. The increase in the same operating expense lines combined was only 5% while revenue increased to 17%.There's still much work to be done and many more opportunities to grow. As such, we will continue to invest in the business including an R&D, SaaS operations, customer services and support, while maintaining our focus to increase costs well below the pace of revenue growth.Operating loss of $2.7 million for the third quarter is an improvement compared to an operating loss of $3.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Net loss for the third quarter was $2.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share, favorably comparing to a loss of $4 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.You will note that we have included the non-GAAP measures, adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share in our earnings release this quarter. We feel that considering income before these non-cash and non-recurring charges results in an EPS measure that is a meaningful representation of earnings available to common shareholders on an ongoing basis.It is important to remember that our amortization expense, which is significant now, starts to taper off starting in fiscal 2022, our fiscal year after next. Less than half of our current run rate of amortization will remain in fiscal 2022 and then less than 10% will remain in fiscal 2024Moving to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2019 was $41.9 million, compared to $40.8 million at March 31, 2019 and compared to $37 million at December 31, 2018. As it relates to our cash flow, we reported net cash provided by operating activities of $5.3 million during the third quarter, compared to $1.7 million of net cash provided during Q3 of fiscal 2019, a $3.6 million improvement.Our free cash flow for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 is $4.3 million better than the comparable prior year. These cash flow results indicate that we are on track for our expectations of significantly improved free cash flow this year over last. During the fiscal 2020 first quarter, we've recorded a right of used asset on our balance sheet within current assets and an operating lease liability, which is split between current and long-term liabilities.These balances are the result of our implementation of ASC 842, the new lease accounting standard that became effective for us in the first quarter of this fiscal year. This new accounting standard requires companies to record liabilities, which were previously off-balance sheet obligations and the associated assets onto the balance sheet. There is no impact to the income statement classification of rent expense or depreciation expense for us.For the fiscal 2020 third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million in the year ago quarter. We continue to carry approximately $220 million of NOL carry-forwards with a full valuation allowance on our books that will enable us to remain liable for taxes only in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. Our NOLs that are subject to expiration expire between fiscal years 2031 and 2030.As it relates to our guidance, given the continued improvements across our business, we are confident in raising our guidance for fiscal 2020 year-over-year revenue growth from 14% to 16%, compared to full year fiscal 2019 revenue of approximately $141 million. We continue to expect an approximate 25% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA of about $10 million.The reason we are again not raising adjusted EBITDA guidance is that, given the increased business momentum we are currently enjoying, we have made some continued investments and accelerating our R&D, professional services and customer support strength. Please keep in mind that fiscal 2019 adjusted EBITDA of $10.3 million had the benefit of about $2.2 million of capitalized software costs, which did not occur in fiscal 2020.Growing adjusted EBITDA by 25% between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 is actually the equivalent of growing adjusted EBITDA by 60%, if we remove the $2.2 million capitalization benefit from the prior year. That 60% improvement on revenue growth of 16%, reflects the significant operating leverage, we continue to work with, as we manage expense-related investments carefully to continue to support future profitable revenue growth.We're excited about what the future holds for Agilysys and the hospitality industry. Customers repeatedly confirms to us that they're hungry for a world-class vendor that can provide a fully-integrated suite of solutions, and they equally confirm they are impressed with how we continue to innovate and progress towards that challenge. We are executing well against our strategic plans, a plan that was set out three years ago and remains materially the same to this day.Our financial results were strong this quarter, but more importantly, the longer term financial trends we have reported are strong and we feel the business is set up well for the future. We will continue to focus, work hard and deliver the products and services our customers want.With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum.
George Sutton: I'm curious, when we do due diligence and talk to existing and potential customers, what we find is a competitor systems being replaced is a fairly slow process; and you mentioned this quarter, you actually saw a fair of that. I'm curious is there certain functionality or foreign types that are the appeal that's causing that change to be made?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Hi, George, thank you for joining the call. The competitive replacements picking up, we've been noticing that trend for quite a few quarters now. I would say for the last four or five quarters, the rate at which we've been replacing major competitive systems because that is what we keep track of replacing. Major competitive system has really picked up and they don't necessarily take too much time George.There have been cases where a customer has contacted us and they have gone live with our product like a couple of months later. Now some of the things that trigger that is there could be a competitor system for whom a hardware refreshers coming up, on the POS side. And while you're spending that kind of money on that refresh, they start thinking why don't we go look for a system. That could be one.The other thing that very often happens is they want certain enhancements done to help their business and very often a lot of those vendors just don't have the engineering breadth and wherewithal to get those changes done quickly. They will want an interface created with another system that they have bought that many competing vendors just don't do and that becomes a compelling event for them to change the system. And their business could expand for which the other vendor may not be able to keep up.I don't think these decisions take too much time, George, based on our experience. But there are cases where, let's say, they're marginally like another system. But they're quite happy with their current system, but they would really like to have a competing system, that could take time. They might wait for a year or so before they really make that decision. But when there are compelling events and there are many, especially with many vendors not doing great customer support, these kinds of things do tend to happen a lot faster than probably what your sample sizes show.
George Sutton: And your product strength and your professional services strength which has been a consistent thing for us to see, can you give us a sense on, is that something we should continue to expect for a period of time? Are we going to start to see the subscription side of it that really start to show that that benefit?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, the product and services strength that you're seeing will lead to recurring revenue and subscription revenue strength. So like how Tony described in his prepared remarks, what comes first is product revenue. So, as part of the sale given the nature of our POS business, a certain amount of hardware comes with it, a certain amount of services revenue comes with it, that's the first thing that happens.And then as we go implement and the customer wants more activities from us, the services revenue picks up. And that's a good indicator of the fact we are doing a lot of implementations now. We are taking -- we're replacing a lot of companies and systems, and we are doing a lot of new product installs of customers who already have other products. So, as a services activity picks up, as we've seen in the last six months, that leads to recurring revenue.So, those customers go live and the recurring revenue you should expect will pick up, and it just so happens that more and more of our customers are preferring subscription-based arrangements. We don't force them into that. We want to be customer centric and we try to do what the customer wants us to do. It just so happens more and more customers want software solutions based in the cloud and subscription based arrangements.So as you see, the product revenue is a good indicator that our business is doing well. We are doing a lot of sales, selling out. Services revenue is a good indicator that we are doing a lot of implementations and in turn that will lead to recurring revenue in the future. And it just so happens. A good portion of the implementations we're doing happened to be SaaS subscription basis.
George Sutton: Lastly, if I could, Tony, it may be helpful because I've had a few client questions the last few days on the potential virus impact on your PMS business. Obviously, I understand the model, but I'm not sure most people understand what limited impact you might see, if travel were reduced?
Tony Pritchett: Yes. So, limited impact on our business but before that George, we do have employees in the Shenzhen and Hong Kong area. So, we are very concerned about this because employee well being comes number one for us, and we care about all our global employees a lot. So, we are very concerned about our employees in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, and to a certain extent Singapore as well. And Malaysia, we have a number of employees there.So, we are very concerned about their well being, and so far so good, they have not been affected. We are nowhere close to the affected region. So, we are closely monitoring it and keeping a tab on that. And we are taking very safe decisions as far as travel and everything is concerned. So, that's the employee part of the answer, which is our number one concern now.As far as business is concerned, we have more than 4,000 properties all over the world who are currently using a system property sites, of which only 20 are in China at the moment. Our China is an initial business for us now. We have a lot of growth potential there, but we have traditionally historically not had a major presence there. So, we only have 20 properties live there. And there are about 20 other new opportunities that we are working on, many properties of them belong to one or two big hotel chains that we are working with.So, it is possible that those deals get postponed due for travel and other restrictions. So, when you think about possible revenue impact may be a $500,000 revenue impact in Q4 and on this fiscal year is possible for us. It is not significant at the moment, but we are watching it carefully. It is not a major part of our business process.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tyler Wood with Northland Securities.
Tyler Wood: First, on for Ramesh, you've talked about increasing success selling modules into your existing customers. Maybe can you drill down a little bit more into that? What specific modules are you seeing, having the most impact there? And then going forward, what do you see being the most important modules for driving growth?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes, so, good to talk to you, Tyler. Thank you for joining the call. So, the modules, let's break them up into POS and PMS separately. So, as far as POS is concerned, the two main flagship products that we have our InfoGenesis, which is more staffing solutions; and rGuest Express Kiosk, which is more guest facing kiosk, where the guests can sell help where they can order food items directly from a kiosk, and it just speeds up a lot of cues and other things in employee cafeterias.Now, there we have an additional product called on-demand, which helps you order the food from either your desktop. So imagine you're in the 15th floor of a building and its 11:30 in the morning, and you're getting ready to order lunch, you can order it from your desktop or you can order it from your phone as well, from your smartphone.So, you're sitting in the hotel room, you can order food items from the phone. And it will even give you details of exactly how many minutes they can sell you the food, depending on what kind of pressures there is in the kitchen. So that on-demand product is an additional software module, which is a good margin module for us, that many of our POS customers are considering and a few of them have already purchased.On the PMS side of the business, on the hotel management system, property management system side of the business, there are a number of products that are already getting good traction in the industry. Like one of them is a direct channel web booking system. So, customers have always wanted a web booking system that is PMS aware that can differentiate you from being a platinum player versus a silver player. Customers are always wanted that because most web booking systems that are out there involve commissions and they are not PMS aware. So that is one module. That has already gone live with about five or six customers already.Then the other one is mobile check-in, check-out. So as if you don't need to go to reception counter, stand in a queue, right from your smartphone, you can get a digital key and you can directly walk to your room, or you can do other check-in, check-out facilities. Instead of going to reception counter, you can also walk to a kiosk. So a couple of customers, a couple of big customers have already gone live with them.Then we introduced a product called rGuest Service, which basically optimizes all the tasks and operations in the hotel. So if you are running a hotel, there are a lot of things happening in the hotel, a lot of tasks including housekeeping tasks that you are assigned to various people. And if somebody doesn't react quickly, it should automatically get escalated to a supervisor. So that products completely automats all that and it integrates well with PMS and POS.So, there's a number of software modules like that that we are creating now that is adding strength to POS and PMS. And very often when you go to our competing vendors, they will point you to a third-party company that will do that module, quite for us the advantages because of our R&D strength, we can do it ourselves and it's also much better integrated with all our core products.
Tyler Wood: And I guess going back to the competitive displacements question. You've mentioned kind of factors I could get people to switches, POS refresh. Is there any kind of developments you see on the horizon, be it pay a table or something like that, that would a new feature, that could sort of spur people into having a refresh those?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. So, Tyler, I can't give you one magic bullet like you create one module and suddenly picks a scale over. All these additional modules, right, including pay-at-table, which one of our biggest gaming customers went live with recently and that is an additional thing, the support now. You keep adding all these modules. You keep modernizing your core product. You keep adding more functionality to your core product. And somewhere along the line, the scale tilts in your favor.And with each customer, how much weight does it take to tilt a scale varies. I can't give you one magic module that now that we have that everybody has to go to work. It doesn't happen that way. We keep adding these competitive advantage trends. And for different customers, that tilting of the scale happens at different times, right, or for different reasons. Like there is no one magic module that's going to create it. But as we keep doing all this R&D innovation work, it keeps tilting more and more towards our phase.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ishfaque Faruk with Sidoti.
Ishfaque Faruk: Gone that guys on the great results. A couple of questions from me. Ramesh, you said you guys got around 18 new customers this quarter. Can you give a sense for how many of those had added PMS solutions?
Ramesh Srinivasan: I think out of the 18 new logos, new customers we won, I think the PMS number is four, if I'm not mistaken. Once we finish this college park, I'll -- Tony and Dave will confirm that number for you, but I think the number is four.
Ishfaque Faruk: And Ramesh, you also said that you're seeing your average deal size increasing would reduce churn in terms of more competition. Can you give a sense of like how much you've seen maybe your average deal size is growing relatively maybe on a year-over-year basis?
Ramesh Srinivasan: No, Ishfaque, I don't think -- the three separate things that you mentioned, Ishfaque, average deal size has to do with the fact that when you go sell a product now there are three other modules we can sell in that same deal, which very often the customer picks up. And we don't measure it exactly my average deal size, but we do keep track of how many of our deals more than 50k per and how many of our deals are less than 50k per. And the number -- the value of these deals now selling about 50k per deal have increased. It's now at record levels. That's much we continue, but we can't give you an exact number on that.Customers churn that you mentioned is an entirely different matter, right. That is a matter of regaining the customers we have. And that is because we service the customer better, now we support them better. And customers normally stay with you when they see you innovating and moving the products forward. So more and more our customer retention is world class levels now, our customer churn is going down. And then new customer, this is of course is an entirely different matter that we already talked about.
Ishfaque Faruk: Okay. And last one from me. Tony, I think you mentioned that your R&D group went up to as much as a 738, I believe. Do you guys expect that to flatten out at some point? Or you expect that to move a little higher?
Tony Pritchett: Ishfaque, we do expect the R&D team to continue growing on an absolute headcount basis. The R&D team will continue to expand from the 730 number that we mentioned. The way to think about R&D from a financial modeling perspective though, is that, this fiscal year you should be R&D pretty close on an annual basis as a percentage of revenue for last year. It's in the 27%, 28% of revenue range. That's a pretty reasonable number to expect going forward for the near-term.Looking into next year, we don't expect any major shifts in that as a percentage of revenue. In out years, past next year, you'd like to start seeing that number tick down as a percentage of revenue. But yes, we'll continue to expand the team as far as headcount goes. But again, we do that smartly as revenue increases and as the business support the need. And again, percentage of revenue is really where we focus from that perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Allen Klee with National Securities.
Allen Klee: My questions on the PMS side, the growth there has been relatively modest for a while now and I'm just trying to understand what has to change to accelerate that? And how do you think about the timing of what it would take to get that to double digits? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yes. Allen. Good question, Alan. Hey, good to talk to you. Yes, the PMS side of it is, is actually less than modest side. So, that is the core worry that is the biggest elephant in the room for us. And we are improving the products, those products are getting better. Now what you see in the room count that Tony gives you is after implementation. So for example, the four or so customers we have signed this quarter, we have not yet implemented them. They have not yet gone live.So, they will act to the room count in the next quarter, the room count we give you is not a sole room count but an implemented room count. So that will improve over time. But to answer your question, there is still more product work to be done, right, in fact Ishfaque's question about R&D expanding, we are expanding our R&D will continue to do so for the foreseeable future while keeping it as a percentage of revenue at the same or levels below where we are today.But we still have some more product work to finish on the PMS side, before we have the kind of competitive advantage that we currently have with the POS side of the business. In the meanwhile, we are also adding all these additional software modules, which when the core product work gets done will put us in a very, very good spot where our competitive advantage in PMS will also be as big as it is in POS today.So, growing the PMS side of our business has a lot of our focus now Allen. And in terms of taking are revenue and shareholder value and all that to great levels, PMS will start contributing in the next few quarters.
Allen Klee: And then in the guidance, it was mentioned that you're keeping your EBITDA guidance and you would mentioned that that's due to reinvesting some of the higher revenue. Could you maybe give some details of what that's being reinvested in?
Tony Pritchett: Yes. So, Allen as we mentioned, I mean, it's a consistent message last quarter and this quarter as well, where we've seen some opportunity this year is to invest in our SaaS infrastructure. We've seen a lot of growth with our SaaS implementations, and we obviously have a lot of new products coming on. So, there's some SaaS infrastructure investments that we've done as well as the R&D team as we've talked the decent amount about already.And then, with customer facing services personnel and support personnel, there's been some additional headcount added there as well, just to support -- continue to support our customers as well as we can. So, we can help address all of their issues, post implementation and any support all the go-live that are happening. But as you can see, our professional services revenue is growing, that comes from the services team that we've built. And that's where most of the investment that we've talked about admission and that we've invested this fiscal year.
Ramesh Srinivasan: And also Allen, as Tony mentioned in his prepared remarks, even though, we're saying that adjusted EBITDA is growing by 25% this year from 10 million also it was last year. If you remove the 2.2 million software capitalization advantage FY '19 had, it's actually a 60% increase in EBITDA 60. So why you grow revenue by 16% that we are guiding to now, growing EBITDA by 60% is quite significant operating leverage. We don't want to overdo that because we want to make sure that focuses on growing the top-line as well. So, we have balancing that out about as best as we can.
Allen Klee: And then last question on professional services, which has been growing very fast. Can you help us understand like how, if you win it win some business, the timing that it takes to implement? And are you uncomfortable with how long it takes and you get paid up front for that? Or is there an issue of paid? Or is that an area that you think that you have to put more resources into? Thank you very much.
Tony Pritchett: So, as far as the payment goes Allen, for professional services, just as a general rule, all of our one-time items that are in a contract. As a general rule, we usually collect 60% of that upfront. That's pretty standard in the industry and generally, that's what we experience as well. Of course, there are certain customers that there's exceptions made for that, et cetera. But generally speaking, 50% of our one-time items upfront and that include professional services.Now, as far as the timing goes of getting installations done, the way to think about that is usually -- and again, this is a broad generalization, but usually we can sign a contract. This quarter, the product revenue would come in this quarter, the professional services would come in a quarter after that, and then the recurring revenue would start coming in a quarter after that. If you're looking at -- generally speaking, it's about a three month lead time from contract signature to implementation.We're pretty happy with that. It's a pretty good balance at this point. And we've got the ability to get customers implemented faster, if they need that. Some customers push out implementations longer than that. So, it's a pretty good balance from that perspective. We're happy with the level that we've got now. Now, as revenue grows as professional services revenue grows, certainly we're going to have to increase the size of the services team. But we feel like profession services margins in the range they're at today, high-40s, mid-to-high-20s, is reasonable to expect going forward. So, we don't expect those margins to come down because we have to add people.
Allen Klee: Actually, can I sneak in one more question? I know you're having your user conference next week. And I was just wondering, kind of what you think that is going to be kind of the focus or there may be something new that you think is important to happen there?
Tony Pritchett: Yes, there's -- Allen, there's no special one-time thing you are expecting in terms of any major announcement or anything like that. So all our customers getting together in the user conference is mostly to give them an update of all the product improvements that have happened in the past 12 months and all the product roadmap, the future improvements that are coming in the next 12 months.Now why that is important for us is that a lot of our customers use either only one of our products or maybe they use two of our products, and now we have a lot more modules and products to offer. So for example, the POS customer it is important, they understand how much advancements we made in the PMS area and vice versa. And if there is already a PMS customer, they should know all the other modules that we have to offer.And the advantages, there will be another customer there, who is actually use that module and who can tell them the kind of return on investment they are getting out of those modules. So there's a lot of shared knowledge among the customers that normally works out very well for us. And also in terms of some of the challenges that they have, they can share with each other as to how the challenge for one of those customers has got sorted out. So that's a major part of it.And we have breakout sessions where we also do training programs, where customers want to get more in-depth training on the products. So, we do that as well. So, it's an excellent gathering of hundreds of customer users. And it also helps us improve our relationships with them, give them both resources update and there is a company is growing, and share with them all those details.So, it's a very powerful event for us that we do once a year that brings our customer base together, and that is a big part of our business growth for us. But no particular, there is no major announcement or anything we are planning at that time. It's a fairly routine once a year even for us.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ramesh for any further remarks.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Sheri. Thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your continued interest and support. Agilysys continues to be well positioned to increase shareholder value. This is a terrific value creation opportunity. We are determined to make good on for our employees, customers and shareholders.I want to also take this opportunity to give a very special thanks to our 1,200 plus team members across the globe, who are working hard every day to make Agilysys a world class company and to our customers who trust us with their investments now more than ever before. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.";[0.1730538477616066, 0.14647809255435318];0.14647809255435318;0.1730538477616066;1
47;AGYS;2020-05-22;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Agilysys’ Fiscal 2020 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder today’s conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference call over to Dave Wood, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations at Agilysys.

Ramesh, please go ahead.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining Dave and me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our CFO. I am participating in this call from my home base in Las Vegas while Tony and Dave are in Atlanta.We hope all of you and your families and colleagues are doing well and staying healthy during these incredibly challenging times.Like many other organizations across multiple industries have reported, our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, the period January through March was very much a tail of two quarters within one. We started the quarter on a high note carrying on the momentum of seven consecutive record revenue quarters before it. It then got even better with our Inspire User Conference during February held at Rosen Hotels and Resorts in Orlando.The conference was highlighted by the highest customer attendance we have seen at a location other than Las Vegas. Attendance of customer users from the hotel and resorts vertical was up 45% year-over-year.The overall number of customer users attending additional training classes and setting up meetings with our technical staff for further product discussions, two crucial user conference customer engagement metrics for us was up 40, 4-0, was up 40% year-over-year. Our increase product innovation velocity during the last couple of years was on full display.Little did we know then that many additional modules like mobile check in, check out, rGuest Service and on-demand which were discussed in packed conference rooms during the conference would move from being nice to have modules to become must have ones just a couple of months later and then everything temporarily changed during March.In spite of the hospitality industry virtually shutting down completely about 32% of sales during the quarter actually happened during March. To put that in context during the previous four quarters, the average percentage of sales which happened during the last month of the quarter was about 43%.While this March was much less than a typical month of March for us it was still reasonably good under the circumstances. One third of our Q4 sales happening during March under such extraordinary tough circumstances was a good reminder that the solutions we provide are mission critical for the industry.As a reminder, please note that unlike many other organizations, we use the terms revenue and sales to indicate two different business metrics. Revenue is, of course, recognized revenue based on normal revenue recognition rules, which are more or less standard across enterprise software companies like us.We use the term sales, however, to refer to actual new sale agreement signed with current and prospective customers for products and services. We measure such sales in terms of annual contract value of sale agreement signed.We also tend to use the term sales, selling activity and bookings to all refer to the same thing annual contract value sales. There is obviously a time lag involved in the conversion of sales to revenue.Now switching back to our quarter narrative, we were well on our way towards our eight consecutive record revenue quarter when the drastic March changes happened, causing us to miss our revenue guidance for fiscal 2020.Q4 revenue was $39.7 million, an 8% increase over Q4 of last fiscal year. Fiscal 2020, full year revenue was a record $160.8 million that is, 1-6-0 point 8 million dollars representing a 14.1, 1-4 point 1 representing 14.1% increase over fiscal 2019. Q4 recurring revenue of $22.3 million was another new record.Subscription revenue was up 9.1% sequentially over the third quarter and was up 29.8% over Q4 of last fiscal year. Professional Services revenue in Q4 fiscal 2020 was up 25% over Q4 of last fiscal year, despite a significant slowdown during March due to travel restrictions and site closures.Adjusted EBITDA during Q4 fiscal 2020 was $3.6 million, compared to $2.4 million during Q4 of last year. Overall, for the full fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $13, 1-3, was $13 million increasing 27% over fiscal 2019 or actually a 61% improvement if you take out the benefit of capitalized software in fiscal 2019.During fiscal 2020, we signed sales agreements which added 55 new customers, 61 new properties, which did not have any of our products before and 152 new instances of selling a product to sites, which were new for that property. Of these sales agreements, 17, 1-7, new customers, 17, again, 1-7, new properties and 35 new products were closed or signed during the January to March Q4 quarter.The IG POS sales win with team San Jose in the sports and entertainment sector. The rGuest state PMS and IG POS win with Saba Rock Resort in the British Virgin Islands. The rGuest state PMS win at hotel 166 in Chicago. The huge 19 site IG POS win with Comwell resorts in Denmark. The rGuest via kiosks and on demand win at Sea Pines resorts in South Carolina. And the IG POS win at the intercontinental Los Angeles and IHG property were among the sales win highlights of the quarter.Before we move on to other topics, one quick update on customer retention, fiscal 2020 was our best year in recent memory with respect to customer retention success. Customer retention was again well over 95% and our best percentage in many years.We measure customer churn and reverse of it customer retention in the old fashioned conservative way. We measure customer churn as a simple division of annual recurring revenue lost during the year as a percentage of total annual recurring revenue. And customer -- and we report customer retention as 100 minus customer churn percentage therefore by definition our customer retention measure cannot be more than a 100%.Please note that we measure customer churn as a percentage of only recurring revenue and not as a percentage of total revenue. Given our recurring revenue is about half our total revenue, churn and its reverse customer retention is even better if you think of it as percentage of total revenue.We are aware that many software companies express customer retention in dollar retention terms using a variety of different formulae designed to make the numbers look great and often report them to be higher than 100%.If we use any of those methods, our dollar retention rate would also be significantly higher than 100%, because the extent of repeat business we get from current customers in terms of new property sites and new products far exceeds the extent of recurring revenue loss during the year. However, we continue to believe that the old fashioned method of calculating customer retention as a percentage of recurring revenue is the right measures.We continue to retain well more than 95% of our recurring revenue base and also further act with significantly through business expansion as you can derive by our consistent increases in recurring revenue year-after-year.Going back to the subject of sales measured by annual contract value of sale agreements closed during a period. Sales during January and February this year was about 40% that is, 4-0, 40% higher than the January, February average over the past four years despite a February slowdown in international sales.While sales during March slowed down as was to be expected and was not the typical high-end to a quarter and fiscal year we are use to. It was still close to 80%, 8-0-, 80% of the February level.Sales during April and May in Q1 fiscal 2021 that is the current quarter so far has been at about 60%, 6-0 percent, of the average of the past four quarters at the same comparable time during the quarter.To reiterate that point, in spite of this global pandemic causing virtually everything to shutdown, we are still able to close about 60% of the value of deals we would normally expect. These products are mission critical and our product innovation engine continues to churn out additional modules and core enhancements, which will help our valued customer manage current realities better.As we have discussed with you before, we have introduced many new software modules in the marketplace during the past couple of years especially during the past year. Many of these modules have already been implemented in multiple customer sites.These modules include, one, rGuest Express Mobile a PMS solution enabling checking in and checking out of hotels without any need for human contact entirely based on one’s smartphone including the use of digital keys.Two, rGuest Express Kiosk a similar PMS solution, which can be used to check in and check out and for other purposes. We have now this kiosk to be essentially touch-free using personal or throw away stylus pens. Guests can bring keys if they so desire through the kiosk or through the use of our new mobile concierge model.Number three, rGuest Service, a PMS module which enables management and optimization of all operations in the hotel including housekeeping and preventive maintenance of crucial assets. This along with two way SMS and other communication between the hotel staff including hotel staff at the reception and guest enables less need for frequent checks with the reception desk on room readiness and other matters reducing crowding around the reception desk.Four, rGuest on demand for POS, this is a software module in our POS family of products, which was introduced during the last year. It enables remote ordering of food and beverage items from a mobile phone for takeout or delivery using a website app or QR code and is completely integrated with our InfoGenesis POS back end.Five, Agilysys authorized for both POS and PMS. This module enables scanning a QR code on a food and beverage or other receipt to initiate payment or charge to a room through the guess mobile device with no human touch or contact necessary. This was introduced recently eliciting serious interest from many customers. One of these customers signed up for use of this module across more than 70, 7-0, across more than 70 profit centers just this week.Number six, contactless payments, we have also introduced other forms of contactless payments.Number seven rGuest book, the need for a direct channel zero commission online booking engine has become even more important for our customer base now. With our new modernized rGuest spa and golf modules already installed in multiple customer sites, customers can now provide their guest the ability to book rooms, spa and golf reservation, all from one place. This includes the ability to handle group reservations as well.Number eight, rGuest Seat, this product now supports booking and managing reservations across any outlet of a property. Guests can see a doll house view of the outlet and reserve a specific seat in a restaurant or a specific lounge chair or cabana in the pool area or a seat in a performance center. Properties have an opportunity to promote social distancing right at the booking process providing their guest an increased level of comfort as they make their reservations. The application -- now this application now also supports yielding of seats giving our operator additional tools to monetize their assets.Now that list is only a subset of all the new modules we have introduced during the recent past, which enables social distancing and improve operational efficiencies, enabling hospitality operators to do more with less. Such modules were nice to have till recently and have now for the most part become must have modules.Our core POS/PMS and inventory management solutions have always enabled operators to be highly efficient but in the current scenario these solutions have become mission critical as our customers look to maximize revenue while minimizing variable cost.While the number of sales agreements closed during March, April and May, have clearly been down compared to previous quarters. We have been surprised to find the number of product demos we have been involved in during April and May especially regarding our emerging products and software modules. It’s been almost double the level that we saw during January and February.The current trend is unmistakably around mobility and contactless service solutions, and we are fortunate to have been busy with precisely that kind of product innovation for a couple of years now.Both our food and beverage POS and lodging PMS solutions now enable a frictionless and contactless experience end-to-end all across the guest journey through a property all the way down from order initiation till payment.One other detail to note, revenue from gaming casinos constitutes more than 50% of our revenue. The interest from our gaming casino customers in our emerging software modules has been particularly high during the past month or so. Many of them are likely to be early adopters of the emerging software modules as they finalize plans to reopen.With respect to our balance sheet, we ended Q4 fiscal 2020 with a cash balance of $46.7 million our highest level since June calendar 2017 Q1 of fiscal 2018. We were fortunate to come into the crisis with the position of strength. The recent $35 million convertible preferred investment by MAK Capital will provide additional balance sheet strength.As is well known the CEO of MAK Capital Mr. Mike Kaufman is also the Chairman of our Board. I cannot think of anyone who knows our business better than him, his vote of confidence in us thus say a lot. Our improved and record levels of financial performance in fiscal 2020 has a lot to do with our increase in R&D and product innovations strength and are passionate focus on customer service.The number of resources involved in product development has tripled since January calendar 2017 and that increase has resulted in our current ability to provide our customers with end-to-end solutions to enable the kind of contactless, safe and comfortable guest journey, our customers have now have an enhanced need to provide.We are determined to keep the innovation and customer service engines going through this current situation and expect to reach the other side of this crisis with an even better competitive differentiation and positioning.While we have been forced to take multiple cost reductions steps like most of other organizations, we have taken care to ensure such steps have minimal to no impact on our product development and customer service areas.Due to the drastic change and uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions and the lack of clarity with future sales revenue and profitability projections by product, there was assessed impediment most of the capitalized software development cost on our balance sheet.As you are aware, we discontinued the practice of capitalizing software development costs as of January calendar 2018 or Q1 fiscal 2019. This impairment action does not affect are ongoing and future product investment strategies in anyway.This pandemic and the related closures have been particularly hard on our customers. We have strived to be a responsible business partner and have tried our best to help them with various forms of one-time credit and product concessions.Among the concessions provided is free use of rGuest on demand product for 90 days. About 60 customer sites have executed contracts for the use of this product and another 250 sites are in the process of signing up.Such one-time credits and product use concessions provided is going to hurt our short-term revenue level, but will help us in the medium and long-term once the recovery begins to take shape.We expect our April to June Q1 fiscal 2021 revenue to be down year-over-year by a possible 35% due to two reasons. A significant portion of that decline will be due to the one-time concessions provided to customers. The remainder will be due to short-term declines in sales and business levels. These declines are almost entirely due to postponements in buying decisions.With respect to the one-time concessions provided to customers, we expect about two-third of that effect to be felt during Q1 and the remaining one-third to be spread out almost equally across Q2, Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2021.Please note these actions to help customers will show up as declines in multiple revenue areas including recurring revenue during Q1. Such declines are expected to be strictly temporary and one-time and should not be interpreted as having anything to do with customer retention. We continue to do well with customer retention.We are beginning to see signs of the recovery process already starting with sites reopening. Assuming the pandemic recovery process continues to keep improving steadily thereafter, we expect 35% year-over-year revenue decline in the April through June Q1 quarter to be the low point. Q2, Q3 and Q4 should be progressively better. However at this stage, we are unable to predict how steep that improvement curve will be.On the one hand, we find our product and services backlog and sales pipeline remaining at high levels now, while on the other hand the decision making in sales finalization processes have slowed down considerably. We are therefore not in a position now to provide any meaningful guidance on overall fiscal 2021 revenue and profitability levels.Regarding profitability, given all the cost reductions steps currently in place even with the possible revenue reductions we face in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect Q1 fiscal 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately breakeven for the quarter.While the current circumstance is definite setback, we have every reason to believe we will come out of this phase in reasonably good shape. We remain a relatively small player in this huge hospitality industry and even a partial recovery in the industry will be sufficient to fuel our growth.We are keeping our focus on keeping up the pace of product innovation and customer service. There is a good possibility that the reduced overall industry business levels in the short-term could be compensated by an increase need for technology solutions to make hospitality guess experiences safer and more comfortable. We expect to be in the frontline of providing such much needed high quality technology solutions and that should serve our financial performance well.With that, let me hand over to Tony for further color on our financials and other business details. Tony?
Tony Pritchett: Thank you, Ramesh. To echo Ramesh’s comments, although, the impact of COVID-19 situation has been dramatic to our customers and our short-term progress, we remain confident in the long-term plan we put in place three and a half years ago. To become a profitable, revenue growth company that leads the market with product innovation. This strategy is now paying off with a flurry of customer activity around our new software modules that Ramesh talk through.Taking a look at our financial results, beginning with our income statement. Fourth quarter fiscal 2020 revenue was $39.7 million and 8.3% increase from total net revenue of $36.6 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in topline largely reflects a 26.3% increase in professional services revenue and a 15.2% increase in recurring revenue offset by a 14.3% drop in our product revenue due to the sudden shutdown our customers were faced with in the last half of March.On an annual basis, we are pleased to see growth across all three of our revenue line items including a record $8.2 million increase in recurring revenue and a $6.5 million increase in professional services revenue.Total recurring revenue represented 56.2% of total net revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter and 52.1% for the full year, compared to 52.9% and 53.6% of total net revenues in the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019.We are also pleased with our robust subscription revenue growth, which grew at 29.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and 24.3% for the full fiscal year. Subscription revenues comprised around 39% of total recurring revenues, compared to 34% of total recurring revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.With regard to endpoints, we currently service about 274,400 rooms and have approximately 62,100 terminal endpoints or 1% and 16% increase respectively, compared to how we exited Q4 of last year. We are continuing to give this metric though more and more our revenue growth is not dependent on endpoint grow.Our add-on software modules that build our ecosystem of products are adding scale quickly. As an example so far, just in the month of April and May we have closed deals for r rGuest on demand and rGuest Authorize that once live in billing will be worth nearly $700,000 of annual recurring revenue for us. These are two of our newer products to help our customers enable social distancing initiatives and are great examples to point out.Ramesh mentioned a possible significant reduction in our June 2020 quarter, our first fiscal quarter compared to our first fiscal quarter of last year. This reduction will be mostly impactful to our one-time non-recurring services and product line revenue. The majority of the reduction is expected to be allocated to one-time product and services revenue while recurring revenue is only expected to be down by a few percentage points from Q1 one of fiscal 2020. Once we get through the first fiscal quarter our recurring revenue should be back near our Q4 fiscal 2020 levels.As for product and services revenue, we currently have a backlog of hardware/software and services that are near record levels. As operations start to open back up, we will accelerate the deployment of the backlog and given we are at about 60% of our normal levels of closing new deals in April and May as soon as we get back to historic levels we should see revenue start to normalize. Given the uncertainty everyone faces right now it is just hard to predict when that will happen.Moving down the income statement, gross profit of $19.7 million compared to $19.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Gross profit margin decreased to 49.6%, compared to 53.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. This gross profit was negatively impacted by $600,000 of credits related to COVID-19 reserves.In addition the professional services team realized the sharp drop in serviceable installation during the last half of March for obvious reasons, resulting in a negative margin impact for the quarter.Looking at operating expenses, excluding charges for legal settlements, impairment and restructuring, severance and other charges, fourth quarter saw 1.8% decrease in operating expenses to $22.7 million, compared to $23.1 million in the prior year period. This decrease in operating expenses is mainly due to decreased incentive compensation negatively impacted by COVID-19.Combined our three main operating expense line items, product development expense, sales and marketing expense, and general and administrative expense were 53% of revenue this fiscal year for the full year. The lowest in the past four years, not even accounting for the fact that in the prior three years we had some levels of capitalized software removed from the income statement.Fiscal 2019 was 57% while fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were 55%, compared to this year’s 53%. Even without the impact of COVID-19, this trend would have been about the same and is a good reflection of the steady progress we are making with our operating leverage.Our operating loss for the fourth quarter of $26.9, net loss of $27 million and loss per diluted share of a $1.16, all compared negatively to the prior year’s fourth quarter losses of $3.8 million, $3.6 million and $0.16 due to the impairment charge taken this quarter.Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both compared favorably to the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted net income of $1.3 million compares favorably to $700,000 in the prior year fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.05 compares favorably to $0.03 in the prior year fourth quarter when normalizing for certain non-cash and non-recurring charges including this impairment charge.As Ramesh commented, this impairment charge was a write-off of the majority of the previously capitalized software development costs. The impairment was strictly due to the current economic conditions and the lack of clarity with our ability to predict future sales and profitability with respect to these products. The impairment does not affect our ongoing and future product investment strategies in anyway.For the 2020, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $3.6 million, compared to $2.4 million in the year ago quarter and for the full year fiscal 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $13 million, compared to $10.3 million. The growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full fiscal year represents 27% growth and if you normalize for the effect of capitalized software development costs in the prior year you would be comparing $13 million to $8.1 million or 61% growth.Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2020 was $46.7 million, compared to $40.8 million on March 31, 2019. More importantly, our cash balance at the end of the day yesterday was approximately $43.5 million and that does not include the $35 million convertible investment by MAK Capital, which should close soon. We are pleased with our ability to manage our liquidity as we navigate these challenging times.As it relates to our free cash flow, I am pleased to see an increase for both the quarter and the full fiscal year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.9 million, compared to $3.9 million in the prior year quarter and $7.2 million for the full fiscal year, compared to $1.7 million in the prior year driving our cash balance increase.As Ramesh mentioned, revenue in our first fiscal quarter of 2021 could be down by as much as 35% due to the customer concessions we are giving along with the slowdown in sales we have experienced. We do expect this to be a low point and assuming our recovery process continues from this point on. The remaining quarters should be progressively better.Given these revenue levels, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter should be around breakeven and the transfer adjusted EBITDA should follow revenue and be progressively better for the rest of the year. Otherwise given the uncertainty of the global markets we are not providing any further guidance now.In closing, we are pleased with our 2020 financial results and with financial stability we have to navigate through our current economic environment. We are fortunate enough to have a good recurring revenue base built on a foundation of mission critical products.Our backlog and sales pipeline are both at historically high levels. As the economy made progress, we feel confident our financial results will react in concert. We just can’t predict the exact shape but of the recovery.With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator. Jonathan?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet from BTG. Your question, please.
Matt VanVliet: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job on the coral things considered especially at the beginning of the year, getting the pipeline built out there. I guess digging in on some of the trends that you saw normally through the quarter and into the end, but some of the concessions that you talked about. Can you just dig a little deeper for us here in terms of how much of a delayed fuse are on some of those to that 90-free windows start sort of the day they agreed to it or is that conditional on the when properties reopen, when businesses at least put in motion our plans to reopen. Help us think about what that could look like on a sort of time series basis moving forward?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. Hi, Matt. Thanks for attending the call. So we are hospitality too, Matt, so we were also -- we are also badly affected by this and so there are limits to how much we could help out our customer though we tried our best.And I don’t want to get into all the specifics, Matt, but this much I can tell you. We break it up into two separate things, as far as the product concession goes. It is like giving a 90-day free trial if they sign up for a much longer period of time.So customers -- and it was for one particular product like we mentioned for on demand. So if they sign up for a longer period of time, which is how customers normally sign up. The first 90 days there is no charge on the SaaS fees and it starts on the day they go live.And so, obviously, the only customers, signing up for that our customers who are just about opening now or have definite plans to open. And the trial period in terms of when they have to sign up -- is only for a certain period of time. It is only for a couple of months kind of thing. So that is on the product concession which is basically for use of a product but they get the first say three months free after they go live with it.Now in terms of the other concessions it takes various forms with each customer, it just depends on the customer. It depends on what kind of preference they have and what we could afford and so you just took various shapes and forms with each customer which will affect for the most part about two-thirds of it will affect Q1 and the remainder of it will get spread over Q2, Q3 and Q4. So that is how much clarity I can give on that for you Matt. I am sorry I can’t get into the specifics because it involves you know confidential details with various customers.
Matt VanVliet: Totally understand. Thank you. That’s great detail to help us here. And then I guess looking at your overall customer portfolio. I am curious of what you have looked at in terms of geographic dispersion and types of industry that you are covering specifically and made some assumptions around what might come back sooner or later. You mentioned gaming might be sort of pushing the envelope to open a little sooner verses something like some of the cruise lines that you have been in I think you are going to at least from my opinion would be longer term to sort of reopen. But what’s the risk in terms of some of the smaller operators that you might deal with or some locations that may not open again or maybe extremely delayed and in terms of reopening. Have you had conversations with customers? Is there any kind of expectation of sort of permanent churn that you could have or is it still currently operating where it’s more of a when and not if, that the majority of your customers in particular will look to be reopening?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. It’s a good question Matt. So, yes, we are -- obviously, we are in touch with all our customer base and we are constantly talking to them and not just in terms of when they will reopen also helping them with their reopening, right? So I will come to that in a second.So the one thing about our customer portfolio, the customer profile Matt is that gently all our customers are of the bigger size, right? We don’t have much of a play in the smaller retail restaurants so that is not the space we play-in at all.So virtually all our customer base is in the bigger customer segment, we are an enterprise software company. We don’t compete much in the smaller restaurant space at all, in fact we don’t compete there at all.So to a certain extent a lot of our customers have much more concrete plans of the reopening compared to what you might find in the small restaurant space. So that is one aspect to remember about our customer portfolio.Virtually our entire customer but we have got all the customers have plans to be open it is only a matter of when they will be open not if they will be open because he’s got all the customers who have videos access -- access to capital and they all have different plans to re open. So that’s one thing to keep in mind.The second thing to keep in mind is, we had a fairly small player like they always say about portal addressable market runs into billions. I mean depending on which study you believe you call it $3.5 billion or $4.5 billion it runs into billions in terms of the recurring revenue of the industry while our recurring revenue is still less than $100 million.So we had a smaller player. So even if portions of the industry reopen later than the others even a partial recovery is pretty -- it should be enough to drive our growth forward, right? So that’s the second aspect to keep in mind.The third thing to keep in mind at least what we are noticing is that, we were quite surprised ourselves we didn’t expect this, that the number of product demos we have done in April and May have been twice as much as January and February, which in a lot of ways, doesn’t make sense, but that is what we have been seeing.So what that means is the fact that part of the industry is going to recover, slower, or going to reopen slower for us and all of them are going to reopen for us, is going to be made up for the fact possibly going to be made up by the fact that they have a greater need for a lot of the technology solutions that we have been very fortunate.We have been in the process of developing for the last couple of years, even if you look up the earnings call script in the last couple of years we have always hopped on all these additional modules, which we believe add strengths to PMS and POS and they are all must have now. I mean the on-demand product, there are more than 300 sites talking about it now and all of them in the last couple of months.So the fact that the business is going to be affected by a slower recovery, we think could be made up by the fact -- could be made up by the fact that there is a higher need for all these technology solutions.So that’s the way I look at the customer profile, it’s mostly bigger customers are our customers, so they will reopen sooner or later. And they have a heightened need for technology solutions that help with social distancing and all that and the fact 50% of our revenue is gaming also helps because they are making quicker plans of what technology solutions they need to reopen.
Matt VanVliet: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I really appreciate it.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Matt. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your question, please.
George Sutton: Thank you, Ramesh. I appreciate you are going thoroughly for module additions I thought that was helpful. So as you think about the mobility part of the equation, when you are talking to existing customers and they decide to move forward with that and I am speaking mobility and more broadly the safe distancing applications that you have. What does that do to the TAM opportunity with that specific account or the ARPU opportunity with that account? And then how much influence is that having on the deals you are working on right now. I assume it’s relatively significant?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. Hi, George. Good to talk to you it’s been a while. Yeah. Now as far as the software modules are concerned, it’s not just mobility, but a lot of it is mobility. I understand what you are saying this is what it does as far as how we analyze Agilysys, right?We have so far we have focused a lot on the number of rooms and the number of terminal endpoints. Those are still important right. Those are still reasonable indicators of how we are growing the business.But now what is becoming of even more importance is the fact that the rooms that we have and the terminal points that we support. There is a lot more products to feed into that. So that is definitely increasing the revenue per unit of room and of terminal points because we have a lot more products to feed into that and it’s not just products, these are all software products that are going to drive recurring revenue and all these products are designed to work both on-prem SaaS and of course more and more of the industry now prefer SaaS over on-prem, but some customers want it on-prem the products are designed to support that as well.So at the moment what we are seeing in the month of April and May is basically feeding into the customer base, we already have for the most part. There are also instances we are seeing, like, we are the number of new logo or new customers, we are talking to has increased more than we thought it would in April and May, because these additional modules now become drivers of the core product as well.Well I mean, we need these additional modules to enable social distancing and everything else we need and your core product needs to support it. It has to integrate well with the core product. For example, we have just introduced the product Agilysys Authorize, which I told you in the prepared remarks that one particular customer signed up for more than 70 profit centers. But that has to work well with the core POS product and it even has to work well with the PMS, because when you go charge a room and you just scan a QR code and with your mobile phone, you can just pay at the table. We still need to make sure if you charge it to your room that by mistake you are not putting a wrong room there or something. So we have to talk to the PMS as well.So to a certain extent these additional modules will start driving our core products forward as well. But at the moment I would say a lot of the interest is in additional modules. There is some amount of driving the core products forward as well. I suspect that will happen more and more in the future.And that does expand our TAM opportunity to answer your question. The total addressable market does get expanded by the fact that these products are not even there a year ago. So to that extent, it does serve the purpose of expanding the market.
Tony Pritchett: Yeah. To add to that just a bit, expansion of the market or expansion of RPU. The way to think about these module is any individual module can add somewhere in the 20% to 50% range of the core product.So for example if the core product is worth $1 or cost a $1, these additional modules individually could add somewhere in the $0.20 to $0.50 range. So if we sell somewhere from two to five of these additional modules, depending on the module you are talking about. We could have double the revenue from that particular unit.
George Sutton: That’s perfect. One other question relative to the concessions you are making as you look at your competitors do you find that they are making similar type concessions. I would have to imagine the hardest call in the world is to call Larry Ellison and to ask for a concession, any perspective?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. I mean, we only know it through customers and some of the friends we have even in our computing companies. I think to be honest with you George, everyone is making an honest attempt, our peer, our competitors and everyone else is doing the best to help.So we got to give them credit for that. I think each company is doing its best to help, because the hospitality industry is badly affected. And we all owe it to our customers to do the best we can.And there are limits to how much we can do as well. We have not that big companies, but I think George, I think each of the competitor is trying to help in their own way. I think the concessions are similar, but not the same, but I think everyone is trying to help, George.
George Sutton: Perfect. Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks, George.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Wood from Northland Securities. Your question, please.
Tyler Wood: Thank you. I will just build off of George’s last question kind of on the competitive environment, when you think about the longer term impact on kind of the competitive dynamics -- in all these changes that are happening in the last few months. How are you guys kind of positioning yourself there and what do you expect some of the lasting changes to be competitively from all this? Thank you.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. So, hi, Tyler. Good to talk to you. So, basically, Tyler, following up on George’s question the one-time concessions it’s just the right thing to do right. That is not about building competitive positioning or anything like that. It is just the right thing to do for customers and all of us hospitality vendors are trying to do the best.But in terms of where we feel we are gaining in terms of competitive positioning is our continuing investments in product innovation and in customer service and also I think where the greatest advantage is building up for us is in the fact in terms of an end-to-end provider.So you take the POS, PMS and inventory procurement products and then all the additional modules we are adding to it. So in terms of helping a customer manage the entire guest journey from the time they do the reservations in a direct channel zero commission website.All the way through the check-in process where they can check in without going to the reception desk, all the way through how they manage themselves within a room where there is easy communication or what they require in the room, all the way through when they go to a restaurant. So every which way end-to-end, we are enabling the guest journey with modern technology products.So when you think of us as an end-to-end hospitality technology software solutions. That is where the competitive positioning is building because we have some competitors who are pretty strong in POS, PMS, but are not doing the additional modules, like we are doing. They are just pointing to third-party vendors to do it. Then we have another big competitor who is very strong in one of the two areas PMS, POS, but not so much in the other.Then we have a bunch of smaller size competitors who are pretty good in each of the products they do, but don’t have end-to-end solutions. So when you think of where our competitive advantage we feel is increasing and will really be -- will shine once the crisis is over. Is in the fact end-to-end software solutions enabling the entire guest journey, I have a feeling our lead is now increasing Tyler. That’s what I see.
Tyler Wood: All right. Thanks. That’s helpful. I will get back in the queue.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Tyler.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Allen Klee from National Securities. Your question, please.
Allen Klee: Yeah. Hi. And any insight on your plans of growing -- of what rate do you plan to grow your or cut your operating expenses for the year?
Tony Pritchett: Allen, hi. This is Tony. How you are doing Allen good to talk to you. As we made commentary on the call, we are not giving full year guidance for any aspect of the P&L. The one thing that you can keep in mind though is that we have indicated.We could have revenue in the first quarter, that’s down as much as 35% from last Q1. And at the same time, if we do realize that type of revenue our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter would be about breakeven and then from that point forward.We expect revenue to go up and adjusted EBITDA would go up from there as well. So while we are not giving specific guidance on operating expense, line items or any other aspects of the P&L, you can make some assumptions. And that’s how -- I would build the model.
Allen Klee: Okay. Thank you.
Tony Pritchett: Absolutely. Thank you, Allen.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thanks Allen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ishfaque Faruk from Sidoti & Company. Your question, please.
Ishfaque Faruk: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions from me. First of all, Ramesh, you said you are seeing a lot more deals still closing in April and May. And also you also briefly touched on some of your social distancing products. Are you seeing, like much more interest in some of your products that cater to that like rGuest Seat, rGuest Express is that’s what’s happening now in this new environment?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. Hi Ishfaque. Good to talk to you. So just to be clear Ishfaque about my comments earlier the sales activity in terms of number of demos and all that during April and May has surprised even us. It is almost double what we did in January, February, and we didn’t expect this much sales activity in April/ May.I mean given the circumstances, the sales activity has increased however, the closure of agreements reaching a decision those are definitely delayed. So a lot of customers are kicking the tires, but the rate at which sales is closing is definitely fallen and March, April and May is much lower, which is why we are projecting Q1 will be a 35% decline on all that one-time concessions is part of the reason.But the part of the reason, also is the fact that the business and sales levels are declining. The activity is there, everyone is intrigued -- everyone like we held two webinars to explain the products and hundreds of customer users attended them one on the 14 and one earlier today.So there is a lot of interest, but the rate at which deals are getting closed. It’s still quite slow because everybody is making plans to reopen and they are being very circumspect with how they sign deals. So I want to be clear about that distinction that is number one.
Ishfaque Faruk: Yes.
Ramesh Srinivasan: And the interest is definitely in the products that enable them to provide their guests with safety and comfort. So yes rGuest Express is definitely part of it, the mobile both the rGuest Express Mobile and the kiosk are definitely part of it.But probably the biggest ones, we are seeing is an on-demand of which is an extension of our POS product set, which enables you to remote order and either pick up or it connects to a delivery mechanism or delivery company that can deliver it to you. There is great interest in that.Then we recently introduced the Authorize product basically, when you get an F&B receipt you can scan a QR code that’s on the receipt and pretty much pay for it through your mobile phone itself, which is the best form of paying table we can provide.There’s a lot of interest in that and there is a lot of interest in seat like you mentioned because that helps you plan out when you want to book like when you -- for example if you want to keep every alternate cabana occupied.You have a way of managing that and not just cabana even a lounge chair, you can create a reservation system thereby which you make sure every alternate a lounge chair is occupied there are a lots of different things you can do with seat.The current interest is definitely in those kinds of products. You are right, but it is having a drag on effect on our core product as well. There is a reflected effect on the core products as well, because we are so well integrated with all.
Ishfaque Faruk: Got it. Got it. That’s very helpful, Ramesh. And also on the professional services segment, Tony, you briefly touched on that that you know and around the end of March, professional services, sort of came to -- activity declined significantly. But are you seeing some pickup in maybe mid-May or any other color on professional services segment for your first fiscal quarter?
Ramesh Srinivasan: Yeah. The slowdown in March was quite significant because of travel restrictions and obviously -- almost all the sites are getting closed. So there was a lot of cancellations. So there where we had our personnel ready to go to customer sites and we were amazed that some of the go lives even the implementations even happen there was one towards the end of March in Memphis, which was even surprising to us.So but more or less everything did slowed down in March and that did affect services revenue in March, no question about it and April was quite bad where April we didn’t have too many implementations going on, we had the implementations, but much, much reduced level and what we have noticed in the last three weeks is things are picking up. Every week, the amount of services bookings has increased over the prior week in the last three weeks or so.So we are seeing definite signs of picking up, but in our Q1 results, you should expect a significant decline in services revenue, because we were working at record levels before and services.The number of implementations we were doing was at record levels. So Q1 is definitely going to be a slowdown. So the 35% decrease in revenue we talked about, you should expect a lot of that right to be in services.But in the last three weeks or so we are seeing every sign of it picking up, and our services personnel are getting booked and in fact June is pretty much getting close to getting fully booked now. We are seeing improvements there, but unfortunately for Q1 Ishfaque it’s too late it is going to…
Ishfaque Faruk: Yeah. Absolutely. That’s very, very helpful, Ramesh. Thank you so much.
Ramesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Ishfaque.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I’d like to hand the program back to Ramesh Srinivasan for any further remarks.

You may begin.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, Jonathan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We've had a busy quarter, and I am pleased to report that we are off to a solid start for the year. Our SaaS and license revenue in the first quarter grew 26% from a year ago to $50.2 million. Our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $14.1 million, up 30% over last year. In addition to our solid financial performance, our team continued to execute on initiatives to extend our position as the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We enhanced and expanded our subscriber solutions. We introduced new tools for our service provider partners that help them operate more efficiently and increase account retention, and we began to integrate the Connect and Piper business units that we acquired from Icontrol in March. In early April, we had a strong presence at the International Security Conference & Exposition, known as ISC West. This is the largest event in the U.S. for the physical security industry. This year's show included a record number of attendees and exhibitors with increased emphasis on connected devices and cloud services. It's gratifying to see how our innovations have driven the industry in this direction. ISC West gives us an opportunity to take the pulse of our channel by engaging with a broad cross section of our service provider partners in direct meetings, training sessions and hosted events. We also introduced a couple of new product initiatives that I'd like to highlight. We demonstrated the way our hardware ecosystem is expanding with new connected devices. For example, we added a new Slim Line Edition of our successful video doorbell product. This new form factor will give our service providers more installation flexibility when deploying Alarm.com's integrated perimeter security solution. We also announced enhancements to our business intelligence offering for our service providers. Business intelligence is a key differentiator for Alarm.com and enables us to better align with the goals of our service providers. Our enterprise grade analytics solution helps our service providers implement a specific set of installation and service best practices that have been proven to increase account retention. Business intelligence reports allow executives and managers to monitor implementation of the identified best practices across the sales, installation and support processes of their businesses. They can see how branches, teams and individuals are performing, track account installation quality and identify and address service hotspots, so that they can better direct resources to ensure a superior customer experience. I also want to share some of the market feedback and observations that I took away from ISC West. First, my conversations with our service provider partners reinforced that we offer the right set of services and have the right go to market strategy. Security centric services delivered by professionals are driving the broad adoption of IoT technology for both homes and businesses. Supported by the Alarm.com platform, our service provider partners are leading the security industry's transformation from traditional alarm monitoring services to broader and more highly valued monitoring and automation solutions. Most service providers are now eagerly adopting new technology instead of resisting change, and our newer offerings generate consistent interest. With these favorable market conditions, we see significant opportunities for continued growth in the North American security channel. A second takeaway is the ongoing proliferation of devices capable of being integrated into an Alarm.com installation. As we deploy fully integrated solutions around otherwise disparate devices, our service providers can extend security, awareness and convenience to more aspects of their customer's home or business. We have seen a steady increase in the attachment rate of home automation devices. This includes both third party products and those that we have engineered. For example, we introduced the Alarm.com Smart Thermostat in mid 2015. Many of our service provider partners have trained their technicians to install and support Smart Thermostats and other automation devices. In the last quarter, the installation rate of our Smart Thermostat increased more than 30% over the same period in 2016. We expect continued growth as we get into the summer season. Finally, as the Internet of Things makes more interesting installations and applications attainable, consumers are looking to service providers for a full complement of installation, monitoring and support services. The Alarm.com platform enables our service providers to efficiently deliver the level of service necessary to capture this high value and growing market segment. Our fully integrated solutions address the needs of these consumers, and our partner services capabilities make supporting them more efficient. Before I turn the call over to Steve Valenzuela, I also want to briefly update you on the integration of the Connect and Piper business units that we acquired from Icontrol in March. Our initial focus has been to ensure that the existing Icontrol customers and subscribers receive consistent service. We've now had a few weeks to dig into the business, and we remain excited about the talented people who have progressed through the on boarding process to join our team. Currently, we are conducting detailed technical reviews of product plans to make sure that we are working together optimally with these new units. We have not encountered any significant surprises, and the integration efforts are proceeding as we had anticipated. To conclude, we are off to a solid start for 2017, and we're looking forward to the year ahead as we continue to execute across a broad set of opportunities. The integration of Connect and Piper is underway. And with our combined engineering talent, we are excited to be in a position to accelerate the development of market leading solutions for our service provider partners and their customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Valenzuela, who will review our first quarter 2017 financial results and provide updated guidance for 2017. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a review of our first quarter 2017 financial results and then initiate guidance for the second quarter and provide our raised outlook for full year 2017 before opening the call for questions. We posted solid results across the board to start off the year. In the first quarter of 2017, SaaS and license revenue grew 26% over the same quarter last year to $50.2 million. This includes a partial quarter contribution from Connect, following the closing of the acquisition on March 8. I'd also like to mention that our other segment achieved growth of 121% year over year in the first quarter, albeit off a small base. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 93% in the first quarter. As expected, this is slightly below our revenue renewal rate of 94% in the fourth quarter of 2016. We indicated in our last conference call that we expected some impact in 2017 from AT&T's 2G sensor program that took effect at the end of 2016. Taking this into consideration, we still expect our revenue renewal rate to stay within our long-term expectation of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenue in the first quarter was $24 million, an increase of 26% year over year. Video camera and video doorbell sales continued to drive growth in hardware. We are pleased to have introduced our new Slim Line Edition of our video doorbell this quarter to add to our portfolio of video products. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 increased 26% over the same quarter last year to $74.2 million. Gross margin for our SaaS and license revenue was 84% for the first quarter, up about 200 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2016 and up 100 basis points from the same quarter last year. This is mainly due to the contribution of Connect, which has a higher gross margin percentage than Alarm.com because of a different model. With Connect, we provide the software and the service provider deploys, manages and operates the software in their own network operation center with their own personnel. The service provider also needs to purchase around server capacity, network operations bandwidth and cellular services. With Alarm.com, all the services I just mentioned are managed by Alarm.com on a turnkey basis for the service provider. Like Alarm.com, Connect also charges a monthly per-subscriber fee but at a lower amount. Comparing the models from a financial perspective, Connect has a lower per-subscriber fee and less costs as the service provider incurs the cost of operating the service. Alarm.com has a higher per-subscriber fee to cover the additional cost of service. This results in Alarm.com having a slightly lower gross margin percentage but higher gross margin dollars per subscriber. Hardware and other gross margin was 23% for the first quarter of 2017. This is down about 200 basis points from Q1 2016 due to the larger contribution from video products. Total gross margin was 64% for the first quarter of 2017, up about 200 basis points sequentially from 62% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is mainly due to the higher SaaS and license gross margin in the first quarter of 2017 as I just reviewed. Turning to operating expenses. R&D expense in the first quarter was $14.5 million or 19.6% of revenue, up from first quarter 2016 R&D expense of $10 million or 17% of revenue. We added 121 employees in the first quarter from the acquisitions of ObjectVideo, Connect and Piper, who are mostly in R&D. We ended the first quarter with 436 employees in R&D, which represents more than half of our total company headcount of 764 employees. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter were $10.3 million or 13.9% of first quarter revenue compared to $9 million or 15.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2016. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase sequentially on an absolute basis in the second quarter of 2017 due largely to our participation at the ISC West conference, as Steve mentioned, that was held in April as in past years. G&A expenses in the first quarter were $15.4 million. G&A expense includes costs for adjusted measures such as acquisition and integration expenses of $3.6 million and non-ordinary course litigation expense of $1.8 million. Excluding these amounts that are also excluded from adjusted EBITDA, first quarter adjusted G&A expense was $9.9 million or 13.4% of revenue compared to $9 million or 15.3% of revenue in the same quarter last year. We held our annual all-employee off-site meeting this year in April, whereas last year's event was held in January. The cost for this off-site are mostly accounted for in G&A. This contributed to the higher adjusted G&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of 2016 compared to Q1 2017. We therefore expect G&A expenses to be sequentially higher in the second quarter of 2017. At the off-site, our teams hold meetings over the course of several days to review our plans and align everyone to our company goals. We were fortunate with the timing of this year's event as we were able to include our newly added employees from our recent acquisitions. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $14.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, up 30% from $10.8 million in the same quarter last year. Given the aforementioned timing of the annual events in the second quarter, we expect just a modest increase in adjusted EBITDA sequentially in the second quarter from the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net income in Q1 2017 was $4 million, up from $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was $11 million in the first quarter of 2017, up 80% from non-GAAP adjusted net income of $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2016. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $63.2 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $140.6 million at the end of 2016. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2017, we used $87.5 million of our cash and drew $67 million from our bank line to fund the acquisitions of Connect, Piper and ObjectVideo. We ended the quarter with $73.7 million of bank debt. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated approximately $13 million in cash flow from operations, up from $7.3 million in the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow in the first quarter was $10.3 million compared to $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2016. Turning to our financial outlook. We are providing initial guidance for SaaS and license revenue for the second quarter of 2017 of $57.8 million to $58 million. For the full year of 2017, we are raising our guidance for SaaS and license revenue to be between $231.7 million to $232.7 million, representing year-over-year growth of 34% at the midpoint of this range. We are also raising our guidance for total revenue for 2017 to $322.7 million to $325.7 million. This includes our guidance for hardware and other revenue of $91 million to $93 million. We are also increasing our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2017 to be between $65.5 million to $66.5 million. We're also raising our guidance for non-GAAP adjusted net income for 2017 to $36.5 million to $37.5 million or $0.74 to $0.76 per diluted share. This is based on an estimate of 49.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year 2017 stock-based compensation expense of $5.5 million to $6 million. We adopted the new accounting standard for employee share-based payments effective with Q1, resulting in a lower tax rate for the first quarter of 12%. We now expect a full year tax rate of approximately 36% for 2017. In summary, we are off to a good start to the year. We are looking forward to the year ahead as we continue to execute on our business strategy and work to integrate our newly acquired teams. With that, operator, please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Nemeroff of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Chris Rochester: This is Chris Rochester on for Michael. Just curious, what was the organic SaaS and license revenue growth in the quarter? Have there been any changes to your expectations for full year revenue contribution from the Icontrol assets?
Steve Valenzuela: This is Steve Valenzuela. No, we're actually right on track. When we did the acquisition, we actually gave guidance for a 12 month period. We said SaaS and license would be -- 12 months, $35 million at the midpoint. And that's for a full 12 months, and it takes into account a ramp over that period of time. So the way to look at this is -- that's over 365 days. There's 296 days in 2017, so if you back into [Indiscernible] Was there a second part?
Chris Rochester: Can you guys hear me? Yes, sorry. Cut out a little bit there, but I can look back at the transcript. Maybe just a quick follow up for Steve T. Looking at kind of the last quarter, now that you've had some time to talk a little bit more with ADT and with the new Icontrol assets under your belt, have there been any discussions to offer the Alarm platform the new Pulse customers? Or is that still too early in the process?
Steve Trundle: Yes. It's still early in the process. But I guess, it would be safe to say that we're having very open discussions with ADT and planning the right path forward to make sure that we're both working together to bring the subscriber the best capabilities possible there. It's worth reminding folks that ADT, for some period of time now, has used Alarm.com for a subset of its business, particularly in Canada and then what used to be called the Protection one business. And then recently, we've had a few dealers pick it up as well. So there's a mix already occurring, and I think we're working kind of hand in hand with ADT to figure out the best way from a road map standpoint to reconcile that mix over time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chelsea Jurman: This is Chelsea Jurman on for Gabriela. You mentioned that you'd had some strong attach rates for your thermostat product this year, and so I was wondering if you can give any update on what the overall attach rate is for home automation devices and how this is tracking versus 12 months ago or what you see the opportunity is being longer term.
Steve Trundle: All right. Chelsea, yes, the overall attach rate on new activations for automation currently is about one out of four installations. Then all of the things that we can overtime do if that data to make either prosperities more efficient or at times even as we've demonstrated with the energy health business at times made utilities more efficient. So that's the trend that's sort of in the right direction and I think we will expect the summer season comes along to see that continue upward.
Chelsea Jurman: Great. And then can you give any update into what full year guidance includes for some of the adjacent markets in terms of vacation rentals or commercial or even international and whether that is a meaningful portion in 2017?
Steve Valenzuela: Gabriela, it's Steve Valenzuela. We did say on the call we saw good growth from our other segment quarter over quarter, year over year. We actually saw growth of SaaS revenue from other segment of 121%. Now it is off a small number, and it's a smaller contribution. We expect -- in the guidance that we provided, we expect to continue to see good growth from the other segment. But just keep in mind, it is a small percentage of our total revenue. So I would just keep that in mind as you look at the guidance number we provided.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nikolay Beliov of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Nikolay Beliov: Question for Steve Valenzuela. Steve, relatively, recently you came on board. And looking at the margin structure provided a couple of years back during the IPO, EBITDA margins of 20% to 25%. And when you compare the last quarter numbers versus the IPO framework in terms of margins, you're pretty close, and you're already within the framework, 20% to 25% EBITDA margins. And gross margin and OpEx are pretty much more or less within the framework. How should we think about -- are you comfortable with this framework? How should we think about EBITDA margin expansion going forward over the next, let's say, two to five years? And then in light of that question, also, Steve Trundle, the organic subscription growth rate, if you exclude Icontrol, has been -- has come down to around 20%, maybe high teens. Is that sustainable? How should we think about the growth rate going forward in light of the multiple -- so like revenue leverage you guys have?
Steve Valenzuela: Let me take the first part of your question. So the actual -- if you look at our guidance for the year, if you look at the SaaS growth, we're coming at about 20.4% growth on an organic basis, 35% for the total. And if you factor in the adjusted EBITDA, 20% that we've incurred in the past, we actually said -- and if you look at the past at the IPO, we gave a five-year range of 20% to 25% adjusted EBITDA. And we said that, that was about two years ago at the time of IPO. So given the guidance we've given now for the year of 20%, I think we're comfortable with that level given that there's still a lot of opportunity for growth. We're not ready to really raise that, and we're comfortable with that 20% range for adjusted EBITDA.
Steve Trundle: Yes. I guess I would just reiterate. I think the two are kind of linked, which are the more comfortable you are with the growth opportunities in the market and sort of the megatrend towards IoT deployment, then the more excited we're going to be about investing to take advantage of that trend line. And that would lead us naturally to not necessarily want to take the adjusted EBITDA margins up to the high end of that range. But that said, I think we're comfortable with the range still, and we'll see sort of how the world unfolds over the next four to five years. With regard to the growth rate, yes, I think we're about where we expect it to be. And we're obviously a much larger business than we were when we went public. But as we build off sort of a larger base, we would expect to see the growth rate taper back from the 20%-plus range a bit, but that's going to be a gradual process.
Operator: And our next question comes from Bhavan Suri of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Bhavan Suri: Maybe my first question is for Steve T. I'll focus on the commercial opportunity a little bit. Just remind us sort of as you -- the go-to-market has been really efficient sort of for consumers, and you've seen some great leverage there. We've talked about the commercial for a little while. What's the overlap between the dealers that sell to commercial businesses? And how is that progressing in terms of penetration? You sort of have pretty solid penetration within the dealers itself to consumers. I'm just trying to get the overlap of that channel and sort of what that penetration might look like as we start executing on that opportunity.
Steve Trundle: Yes. That's a good question. We seen, it varies. So out of 6,000 service providers that are going to be all over the map, a handful are probably purely residential. But the majority, especially when we get down into what we call the carriage trade component of the service provider base, the majority are doing residential and commercial already. That mix can be as high as 50-50 in some cases. We also see a couple of our larger partners that we've talked about, the Guardian or at Vector or an ADT also selling both commercial and residential. So the market is a little smaller than residential, probably in terms of number of sites. The commercial markets in the U.S., more like 4 million as opposed to 22 million that we associate with monitor and security. But I think there's significant overlap. And therefore, we think that as we begin to progressively deploy more and more of the commercial future set and go after a couple of the components that are needed for a full solution, one of these being access control, that we'll see pretty reasonable uptake. That will take time. The one challenge with commercial is most of the sites are already monitored and have some amount of existing equipment, existing service that they're receiving. So you have to wait for a cycle of those sites who are going through an upgrade, and we would hope to be in a place to, with our service providers take some gains there.
Bhavan Suri: Got it. That was really helpful. And then just turning to guidance, Steve V., here. When you look at the hardware guidance, it sort of implies that you're not, despite of the comments about sort of solid growth in thermostat and stuff, it doesn't feel like you're accepting any growth in hardware for the rest of the year. Maybe my math is slightly off, but it feels like you're being just a tad sort of conservative on that. How should we think about sort of full year guide vis-à-vis sort of the outperformance that we saw in Q1?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. We did see hardware revenue in Q1, up $24 million, 26% year-over-year growth, but we just want to be cautious here. Hardware is not a recurring item like SaaS and license revenue, so we don't see any benefit of really putting a large number out there. So I think we're comfortable with the guidance we provided.
Steve Trundle: So that's a good straightforward answer. I'll just add, though, that we do see -- one of our goals is always to drive as much cost out of the components as possible. So we want the customer to benefit from as many devices as they can, and there's an economic equation there. So it's in our interest to try to shift down the cost structure of some of these elements such as video cameras, doorbell cameras, thermostats, et cetera. I think what we're seeing in our work and our models is higher unit sales, so unit sales turning up. But at the same time, we're doing everything we can to drive down cost to the consumer, and I think we're making some meaningful gains there. So you end up with sort of a flat line sort of top line, but we get probably better impact and better customers, which helps us with the SaaS line.
Bhavan Suri: Great. So one quick follow-up, and just because I'll push back a little bit. So obviously, also really good SaaS outperformance in the quarter, and it feels like you were also conservative on that line. And so a directive answer because that would be great, just to help me understand how you guys are thinking about that because obviously that is recurring. And it feels like you did well in Q1, but the flow through is maybe a little more muted than I might have thought.
Steve Valenzuela: Well, we did raise the guidance for the year, right? So if you look at the. So we did raise the guidance. So we said for the year, the range is now $231.7 million to $232.7 million. So we raised the right range, and we also raised -- we also initiated guidance for Q2 of $57.8 million to $58 million. So those equate to very good growth numbers.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Koban of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Mike Koban: This is Mike Koban on for Tavis McCourt. Honestly, a bunch of mine have already been answered. Just kind of some general stuff here. You guys have mentioned that the integration was going very smoothly, and then everything seems to be on track. So I guess my first question is what do you -- if everything continues in an ideal world to go as smoothly as it did this quarter, how long do you think this integration process will take?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So this is Steve Trundle speaking. We've -- in the quarter, we had about eight days to work on things, and we've had about 1.5 months, a little more than, I guess, about 1.5 months afterwards. And so far, so good. We're -- we haven't -- I think one of the biggest things is when you do an acquisition like this and you're not able to sort of embed in the company until the day after the deal is completed, one of the things that you're concerned about is what are your surprises going to be. What are the things that you weren't able to discover because you were somewhat -- I mean, if you remember the challenges we have with the FTC, we weren't really able to embed very deeply in any sort of normal diligence process. So, so far, we've been pleased that we haven't had any surprises. Integration is going smoothly. We're seeing opportunities to grab some synergies on R&D work, so domains where the Connect team may have expertise that's particularly strong, and domain is certainly where we know Alarm.com has strong demand expertise. So I think we'll let that continue to unfold throughout the year. I would bet that by the end of the year, we'll have a pretty good picture of how the teams are working together. And we'll have very common set of shared objectives, and we'll also have an understanding with the largest customers of Connect on exactly how they would like to move forward into '18 and '19. So that's roughly the way I look at it. And there will be a lot of activity. It's not as if we're waiting, putting off, procrastinating till the end of year or anything. There's a lot of activity sort of every day. But I would expect by end of year, really we're talking about one entity at that point.
Mike Koban: Great. And I guess just kind of on the -- while we're looking at these acquisitions. If I'm remembering correctly, you completed the acquisition of ObjectVideo before the quarter was over. Did that have any contribution to, in any financial material way, this quarter?
Steve Valenzuela: It did not have a contribution in a material way. It didn't have a slight contribution. I think the important point with ObjectVideo, we acquired some great technology and some great people, so that's really the focus there and some video analytics capability that -- with some great technology. So that was really the focus of the acquisition.
Steve Trundle: It drove up -- to the extent there was impact, it really wasn't on top line. It was on our R&D cost structure. So we obviously made some moves in the first quarter to expand R&D. ObjectVideo is a big component of that. And that's probably where we saw more impact than anywhere, first quarter.
Mike Koban: And then my last question is just on this hardware line item, seeing that the gross margin clearly seems to bounce around a reasonable amount. And I know it's not as much of a strategic imperative for you guys, but I believe you said as the video line and the video doorbell windows are higher proportion of revenue or a higher proportion of that line sales tends to affect the gross margin. So do you have any plan to try and sell hardware items within this that are higher gross margin? Or are you just kind of viewing that as a way to get people in the door, into the ecosystem?
Steve Trundle: No. Generally, our strategy with hardware, first, is to defer to our hardware partners whenever we can and whenever we think that's a reasonable approach. But if it's hardware that we're producing, then our goal is -- typically, that's going to be a hardware that enables a -- that directly enables a service. So a video camera enables a video service. A cellular module enables an interactive home security experience. So in those cases, we're generally going to lean towards running that -- those efforts at margins like what we've done in the past. And there'll be some volatility quarter-over-quarter, just because the mix will shift to product, new product comes out. And they have slightly different margin profile, or people may buy more of one thing at one quarter versus another. But generally, the range we've shown is probably where I think we'll keep that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Gearhart of First Analysis. Your line is now open.
David Gearhart: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the international business, if you can give an update there. I think on the last quarter call, you're running at about 3,500 additions per month. Just wondered if we can get an update on what the current run rate is and what you're seeing in international.
Steve Trundle: Yes. In terms of what we're seeing there, we're not -- we're probably not going to update the run rate each quarter, but we have continued to make progress. The pipeline is solid. We're in the process now of -- with Securitas of launching in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. I think in a couple of those markets, we still have to localize the app. I know in Iceland, for example, we need localization. Seeing more opportunities in other sort of markets, so we've got active cycles now with an entity in Israel. And generally, it looks to us -- I've seen a little bit more uptake in Latin America so far. So things are generally going as we expected. I think international is still a place where the business is less predictable than the North American market. We do hit issues occasionally that take us a quarter or two to work through, particularly on the product side. But that gives you a little bit of color, so things are moving. And generally, by end of year, we think we'll be ahead -- be about where we expected to be.
David Gearhart: And then if we could shift back to ObjectVideo. Just wondering if you could shed any insight into some product ideas that you're thinking about or is it too early to expect any color there?
Steve Trundle: No. I think I can give a little bit because we showcased this or at least talked some of our thoughts at ISC West. So ObjectVideo has a track record in video analytics that's almost unmatched, and we're trying to bring a lot of those capabilities to residential-grade, low-cost cameras that traditionally haven't had much processing power. So it starts with fairly simple stuff, like filtering out events that might trigger a motion to cliff when the event is meaningless to the user, so we want to be able to train the system. And if something like a moving tree branch is generally a motion in a video clip, we want to filter that out. We want to be able to do things like tell the direction that someone is moving, whether coming in or out of a door. If they've left a package on the front step, we want to be able to make that determination. So there's a whole slew of, basically taking a device that's been relatively, at least on the residential side, been sort of short of an intelligent device and making it intelligent, so that it becomes far more valued and useful to the consumer. And a lot of this also will be applicable to what we're trying to do on commercial. So those are a few things that we see going forward that the team is focused on.
David Gearhart: Okay. And then last question for me. You talk about the 20 million-plus homes that have some sort of security system in place. Just wondering, as you look at do-it-yourself, monitor-it-yourself solutions, do you see a path to using those kind of capabilities or solutions to attack more of the market that may not have professional installation or have somebody professionally monitor it? Do you see it as a potential additive to your business over the next few years?
Steve Trundle: Our experience so far in that segment has been one where, two parts to the answer. One is do we have the technology to enable that segment? I think the answer is probably yes. The second question is does it make rational economic sense to compete in that segment. And thus far, our calculation has been no, that we're better off focusing on our service providers. We think they're going after probably the more attractive part of the market. And therefore, in the near term, anyway, next couple of years, I think we'll remain focused on doing everything we can to make our service providers as successful as they can be and probably not getting into as much of the self-monitoring business, unless one or two or more of our service providers sort of pull us in that direction and implement a business model that we think works for the long term.
Operator: And our next question comes from Darren Aftahi of Roth. Your line is now open.
Darren Aftahi: Just 2 questions, I think, for Steve Trundle. One, you always had good growth last year on video products. I you know you talked a lot about attach rates with thermostat. I'm just kind of curious if you're seeing any change in the demand for video products and whether people are looking for video doorbells versus a full-service kind of peripheral solution. And then your time at ISC, any feedback in terms of any kind of hardware, whether you're internally developing or OEM that may be missing on the platform that some of your service providers are looking for?
Steve Trundle: Sure. So on doorbells, just to make sure I understand that you're asking for sort of the mix of doorbell uptake versus regular video uptake?
Darren Aftahi: Yes. Wondering if you're seeing any kind of general slowdown in that demand.
Steve Trundle: No. I mean, doorbell seems to be probably gaining momentum. We're shipping this quarter a new instantiation of the doorbell that's called the Slim Line which is more rectangular and narrow, so it fits more different types of door frames. It has a slightly lower price point in some cases. So I think we'll continue to see that item perform. It does pull through some video sales. And video, once you have one camera and you're watching your front door, it's not atypical for someone to say, Look, I can see that. I might also want to see my driveway or my backdoor. And likewise, if someone gets video, they often want doorbells. So there's quite a bit of overlap there. I would say the majority, probably two thirds of the installations that get doorbell get a full video service, and something less than one thirds choose doorbell only. So that's sort of the trend line we're seeing, and I think we'll see that sort of continue to inch up, particularly as we bring to market some more elegant video monitoring capabilities for the consumer. With regard to the device mix, yes. We're always working on taking feedback from the dealers, from the service providers on what they need for devices and trying to execute upon that. And we have a mix of cameras coming out throughout the year that are either more industrial grade in some cases; in another case, some slightly lower cost. We've added audio to a number of the cameras, so there are upgrade cycles on the video cameras and a couple new form factors that will show up as the year progresses.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Kessler: You may -- I may have missed this part, but have you been able to pair? As you move into small business and other non-resi businesses, have you been able to start pairing things like EnergyHub or other ancillary apps that you've been producing with your moves into small business where they might be taking -- that might be taking a broader range of product?
Steve Trundle: Right. To your question, Jeff, I think EnergyHub -- so EnergyHub is applicable to really any location. And if a small business is deployed with either our Smart Thermostat or one from a variety of our competitors even and they happen to be in one of the markets, which is ever growing, where there are programs for thermostats from the utility, then we can enroll that device, and we can generate some EnergyHub revenue and also some revenue for our service provider, which is the cool thing about that program. With regard to some of the other technology, I think what we're going to see is that some of the things we've built for the PointCentral business around unattended access and unattended delivery are going to make their way into our commercial offering for small businesses towards the end of the year, so we'll get some probably pickup there. Beyond that, no, I think those are probably two good examples. And -- but energy definitely is a part of the -- is part of the equation with the small businesses. If you've got hundreds of facilities out there and you're trying to reduce the cost and we can tell a story that energy management will, in some way, shape or form, begin to pay for your security services, that's a pretty compelling message. So we do use that.
Jeffrey Kessler: I noticed that when I was over in Europe that -- and I get it is a different business model. I get that at the beginning. That Verisure is running around with kind of standardized -- I'm not going to say suitcases, but standardized presentations to homeowners. And I'm wondering if you're seeing a more standardized type of marketing approach by -- particularly by your midsize and smaller dealers who may have -- who may not have all the flexibility that your largest dealers have. Are they beginning to -- here's the line of products that we offer. Here are the apps that we offer. Here is the way Alarm.com fits into it to make that sale a little bit more easily understood by the end user and get you into that house a little more quickly?
Steve Trundle: So we've seen progress on that, but that still represents an opportunity for us. So by progress in prior quarters, I've talked about Customer Connections and the adoption by our service providers have a lot of our marketing materials and everything from content for their websites to live blogs that are rebranded to, in some cases, lead services and then the CRM component, which is Customer Connections, to drive referrals and to drive upsell activity. So where we've been successful with that, I think we're getting good results. We're not where I would absolutely like to be. And that in a perfect world, all of our smaller midsize dealers would have migrated to more thematic marketing that's consistent with a lot of our messages. And that process is underway. It just takes a long period of time. And it's not something we are completely in control of. But I think we're seeing the trend in the right direction, but it would be too early for me to say that we've seen and gotten to the point where folks are as consistent as we would like.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim. Your line is now open.
Nehal Chokshi: Now that the Connect business of Icontrol has closed, are you seeing any evidence of pricing pressure or pricing power from your dealer network?
Steve Trundle: I would say we always see evidence of pricing pressure, meaning our service providers are always working in a competitive market, competing with large new entrants and others, and whenever possible, would like us to be as aggressive as we can in the way that we price our services. So that hasn't changed. It's been sort of a fact of life since we got started. So I haven't seen anything that's dramatically new there. In terms of pricing power, no. Likewise, I would say we haven't really seen any evidence that we have newfound pricing power. It's a big market with lots of folks sort of approaching the market with different business models, everything from retail products that customers invest in, installing themselves and expect free service for, to cable bundling with lots of different offerings. So no, I don't think we've, we're seeing a market that's any less competitive than the one that existed before we completed the acquisition.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. And I do have a separate question. I want to follow up on Bhavan's assertion that the guidance is conservative. I did notice that the EBITDA, at least for the March quarter, was about $1 million. And I believe that the raise for the full year is about $0.5 million. So what I'm going to have to do with my model here is take the remainder, remaining three quarters down by $0.5 million on the EBITDA. I think it's kind of a similar story on the SaaS as well, though not as much. And just want to understand what's the dynamic there, and why isn't this a forbearer of things are getting a little bit more tough as opposed to just being conservative?
Steve Trundle: Well, starting with the EBITDA component, I think what Steve Valenzuela referenced in his component of the call was some expense shift from Q1, Q2 that, to Q2, which is fairly material expense. We held our all-hands company meetings in the first month of the second quarter. We had all of the new employees, the 121 new employees we talked about it, at those meetings. So that entire event moved from, moved into Q2. And therefore, it's a little, it's not, we can't just sort of extrapolate Q1 EBIT performance and push that out in all the subsequent quarters, just because there's been a little bit of a shift there. With regard to general degrees of conservatism, I don't know if I can comment on us being more conservative or less conservative this quarter than prior quarters. We attempt to guide in a way that we think is consistent with our management plan, and we hope to overachieve. I will say that we are going into our first full quarter now after the acquisition, so we certainly want to make sure we understand all those dynamics, and that's underway.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. We only have 24 days, really, in the first quarter with the acquisition of Connect and Piper, so it makes sense to take that into account as we look at the guidance for the year.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you, that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: So I believe that's our last call, and I understand the conference call provider had some technical difficulties. So we will be posting the prepared remarks on our website or the Investors section of our website. Okay, great. So with that, I think we're done. So.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. We do apologize for any technical issues experienced on today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.";[0.18117274811481932, 0.034045943360899944];0.034045943360899944;0.18117274811481932;1
49;ALRM;2017-08-12;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alarm.com Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Jonathan Schaffer with Blueshirt Group. Please go ahead, sir.
Jonathan Schaffer: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alarm.com's 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

This conference call is being webcast and is also available through the Investor Relations website. So with these formalities out of the way, I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Trundle. You may begin.
Stephen Trundle: Thanks, Jonathan, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver solid results this quarter. Our SaaS and license revenue in the second quarter was $58.9 million. This is an increase of 40% from a year ago and includes the first full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Connect that we closed on March 8 of this year. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $15.9 million, up 31% over last year. Throughout the quarter, our team continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions for our service providers and their customers. We expanded the Alarm.com platform with new connected devices that will facilitate the deployment of our services and help drive customer engagement and retention, and we continue to integrate Connect and Piper into our operations. Let me begin by discussing some of the enhancements we made to our video product portfolio. Last year, during our first quarter call, I described our strategy for expanding our portfolio of video cameras, such that we can engage a wider set of customers and continue to drive higher video attachment rates. Since that time, we have made good progress on this plan. We successfully added a video doorbell suite that many of our service providers have rapidly integrated into their sales, service and installation routines. We also expanded our portfolio of video cameras. This past quarter, we introduced 2 new residential cameras: the Alarm.com 522 and 722 series indoor and outdoor cameras. These new indoor and outdoor models offer increased capabilities for a superior overall user experience. We improved both the image resolution and performance in high-contrast lighting environments. Importantly, both cameras also have increased onboard computational power for processing advanced video analytics that we plan to deploy, over time, to both new and existing customers. We also introduced new commercial-grade video cameras during the quarter. The Alarm.com 725 and 825 cameras offer performance characteristics and price points aligned for smaller sized properties within our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. These new cameras round out our existing portfolio and allow our service providers to engage a wider range of commercial customers with their video services. In addition to the new video cameras, we also integrated a new commercial-grade security panel, the 2GIG Vario and a new version of our system enhancement module, which enables existing small- and medium-sized businesses that use the DSC PowerSeries control panel to work with Alarm.com. We believe that these and other investments we are making in our commercial offering will help us broaden our addressable market. And as the year continues to advance, I expect that we will bring additional commercial capabilities to market. Next, I want to spend a moment on the suite of back-end services and tools that we provide to our service providers to help them more effectively market, install and support our solutions. We refer to these resources as our growth and productivity services. On last quarter's call, I spoke about our deployment of business intelligence to help our service providers optimize their businesses to drive greater customer loyalty. Another key program is our CRM layer called Customer Connections. Last year, during our Q1 call, I introduced Customer Connections to you shortly after we had launched the program. In the year since, we've added many additional pre-configured campaigns that our service providers can use to engage with their customers to generate up-sells, generate referrals and drive further consumer engagement. Our service providers can now even use Customer Connections to campaign to their base of customers who do not have Alarm.com services. Today, more than 1,400 of our service providers participate in our Customer Connections program, and more than 900,000 of their customers are enrolled. I also want to update you on the progress we're making on the initiatives that we report in our Other segment. While these initiatives are still early-stage opportunities, I'd like to highlight them occasionally as we believe they demonstrate the full reach of our platform. One of our subsidiary initiatives, PointCentral, offers an enterprise-grade property management and unattended access solution. Their market includes vacation rental properties, residential REITs and businesses requiring unattended delivery solutions. One of their partners is a leading residential REIT with a portfolio of more than 30,000 properties. As this customer has begun to deploy PointCentral's unattended access solution to its properties, they have seen a significant increase in the productivity of their leasing consultants. More than 60% of prospective residents now choose to sell show properties. Potential tenants can select a convenient time based on their own schedules without having to schedule with the leasing agent. An additional side benefit of the deployment has been reduced utility bills as they also deployed our energy management solution. Finally, before I turn things over to Steve Valenzuela, I also want to update you on our integration of the Connect and Piper business units, which we acquired from Icontrol Networks in Q1. We have now had a few months to examine the businesses, meet with customers and employees and learn their operations in more detail. We feel like we have a strong base of key team members in place, and we've initiated several joint development projects with the Connect and Piper teams, as we seek to add velocity and scale to our R&D operations. At the same time, we are very focused on meeting the current and future needs of the key customers of these new units. To conclude, we are pleased with our results and achievements in the second quarter. Our team continues to execute on our growth plans and our focus remains on providing innovative solutions to our service provider partners. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Valenzuela, who will review our second quarter 2017 financial results and provide updated guidance for 2017. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a review of our second quarter 2017 financial results and then provide initial guidance for the third quarter and our raised outlook for full year 2017 before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue for the second quarter grew 40% over the same quarter last year to $58.9 million. This includes the first full quarter revenue contribution from Connect, which is in line with our expectations that we outlined when we closed the acquisition. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 93% in the second quarter, consistent with our revenue renewal rate last quarter and the same quarter last year. Hardware and other revenue in the second quarter was $27.1 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This increase was largely driven by strong sales of our new video cameras and the new Slim Line Edition of our video doorbell that we introduced in the second quarter, which outpaced our expectations. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 33% over the same quarter last year to $86 million. Gross margin for our SaaS and license revenue was 86% for the second quarter, up about 250 basis points from the same quarter last year. This is mainly due to Connect, which has a higher gross margin percentage than Alarm.com as we have previously discussed. Hardware and other gross margin was 21% for the second quarter. This is up about 100 basis points from Q2 2016 and down about 140 basis points sequentially due to a combination of product mix and costs related to the introduction of our new video and doorbell products. Total gross margin was 65% for the second quarter, up about 100 basis points sequentially from the first quarter and up about 400 basis points from the same quarter last year. The higher gross margin in the second quarter is due to a combination of higher SaaS and license gross margin and a higher mix of SaaS and license revenue accounting for 68.5% of total revenue for the second quarter compared to 65% in the same quarter last year. Turning to operating expenses. R&D expense in the second quarter was $20.1 million compared to $10.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. We ended the second quarter with 457 employees in R&D, up from 290 employees a year ago. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter were $11.9 million or 14% of revenue compared to $9.9 million or 15% of revenue last year. G&A expenses in the second quarter were $13.5 million, down from $14.2 million in the year-ago quarter. G&A expense includes non-ordinary course litigation expense of $1.3 million in the second quarter compared to $4.7 million in Q2 2016. Non-ordinary course litigation expenses are part of our adjusted measures and are excluded from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $15.9 million in the second quarter, up 31% from $12.1 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, GAAP net income was $9.9 million and non-GAAP adjusted net income was $16 million. Our tax provision in the second quarter was a favorable benefit to net income in the amount of $4.5 million. This tax benefit is a result of the combination of additional R&D tax credits and a favorable impact from the new accounting standard for employee share-based payments from employee stock exercises in the quarter. We are required to recognize the tax windfall benefits in the quarter employees exercised stock options under the new accounting standard, and this will cause our effective tax rate to vary from quarter-to-quarter. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $68.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $11.8 million in cash flow from operations and $8.7 million of free cash flow. Turning to our financial outlook. We are providing initial guidance for SaaS and license revenue for the third quarter of 2017 of $60.6 million to $60.8 million. For the full year of 2017, we are raising our guidance for SaaS and license revenue to be between $233.3 million to $233.8 million. This compares to our prior outlook for SaaS and license revenue of $231.7 million to $232.7 million. We are also raising our guidance for total revenue for 2017 to $326.3 million to $327.8 million, up from our prior guidance of $322.7 million to $325.7 million. This includes our raised guidance for hardware and other revenue of $93 million to $94 million. We are also increasing our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2017 to be between $66.5 million to $67.3 million, up from a prior range of $65.5 million to $66.5 million. We are also raising our guidance for non-GAAP adjusted net income for 2017 to $47.5 million to $48.3 million or $0.96 to $0.98 per diluted share. This is based on an estimate of 49.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year 2017 stock-based compensation expense of $7 million to $7.5 million. In summary, we are pleased with our results for the first half of 2017. We are focused on executing on our business strategy and investing in our growth opportunities while continuing to deliver solid financial results. With that, operator, please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse.
Michael Barry: Steve Trundle, have there been any material updates regarding your relationship with ADT? Obviously, the long-term goal will be to replace Connect with Alarm. But in the near term, is there any functionality that you can also layer on top of the existing Pulse base to increase the monetization opportunity?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. If there were really material developments, we would obviously put those out. So there's nothing material that we haven't updated on. In terms of the relationship, we're working, taking our direction from ADT. And as I've said in the past, do have the goal of increased synergies between the 2 platforms. So there are certain capabilities, for example, that may exist in the Alarm.com platform such as the - what we call the lifetime value builder, the ability to present existing customers with offers on how they can expand their system. And I think it would make a lot of sense and obviously, be in line with the goal that I think we and ADT would share to take that type of capability and look for ways to fold that into the experience that the existing Pulse subscribers are getting. So there are lots of discussions about that sort of thing, and I wouldn't necessarily say, hey, we're going to absolutely replace Connect. But the goal really is to look for opportunities to move towards a single platform, at least in terms of capabilities, look for more synergies on our side between our team and the team - the solid team we've inherited in Redwood City, and it will take some time to unfold. But certainly, if there were anything absolutely material, we would have to put that out.
Michael Barry: That's helpful. And then, Steve, I'm kind of curious, for the last couple of quarters, you've said that the video doorbells and cameras have performed above expectations, and that's been obviously driving the hardware beats. What's the penetration of those video doorbells and cameras in the existing subscriber base? And then on those video cameras, the new ones that you're putting out with enhanced capabilities, how should we think about refresh cycle? Do you typically see customers replacing with newer cameras? Has that happened in the past?
Stephen Trundle: Good question. Yes, so the doorbell camera has surprised us a bit. It had been really a driver on a lot of new activations. I believe that we're seeing doorbell go on about 1 out of 8 every - 1 out of 8 installations at the moment, so call that 12.5% or so. And then, that, combined with some of the new cameras that I spoke about a moment ago, is also driving a higher attach on new installations with video, more like 1 out of 5 at this point up from, I think, maybe a year ago it was about - that number is more like 12%, 13%. So we're seeing some positive trends there and it's been part of our strategy to try to drive some of the costs out of the camera lineup, make it more accessible to our service providers and then the consumers adopting. As far as upgrades to the camera, we haven't seen a lot of that. The cameras are designed to work for a long period of time. So if they're working as designed, the customer should not need to replace them for any sort of reliability issue. I think we may begin to see some though, because the quality of - the image quality and the night quality capabilities in the new lineup are substantially better than what we were putting out 2, 3 years ago. And then the processing capability on board the unit allows us to support, as I noted, a higher degree of analytics. So there will be some functional reasons that I think a customer may want to upgrade going forward. But to date, we have not seen a lot of upgrades there.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.
Nikolay Beliov: You noted in your prepared remarks your progress in video and the M&A integration. I was wondering if you can give us an update on the international strategy and uptake you're seeing with your large partners in Europe.
Stephen Trundle: Yes. So in our international, I didn't comment as much on that this quarter, but we continue to make progress. I think we have now launched, I think I noted we would launch and I believe we have launched with - in Europe with Securitas in Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. We haven't yet rolled in Iceland or Sweden. But those are on the near-term docket. We're also working with other prospects in Europe or existing actually already signed dealers. We have activity in the U.K., Ireland, Spain on the commercial side. But more generally, internationally, I think what we're seeing is some of the markets that I haven't talked about maybe quite as much like LatAm, are beginning to pick up a little bit of speed. The release of the SEM product for PowerSeries panel should help us there some. And the product is beginning - when I say product, in this case, I mean really the hardware products. So we're getting a little closer to being dialed in on a configuration of hardware products that we can reliably take forth to our service provider partners and rest of world. And I think, therefore, we may be getting a little closer to turning the quarter - turning the corner. Functionally, we're seeing strong contribution from ADT Australia and solid contribution from New Zealand as well. So it's moving along. We're not going to update every quarter on exactly where we are, but the total number of subscribers at this point is up about 100% versus a year ago. So we feel like the team is making solid progress, and we'll keep plowing ahead. And it takes a while to build momentum, but it's making progress.
Nikolay Beliov: And my second question is around the growth margin framework with EBITDA within the long-term framework you guys provided in the past. How do you think about the trade-off? What are the puts and takes at this point?
Stephen Trundle: Well, the trade-offs. I'll start because the trade-off is kind of a conceptual question, which is we always think about growth versus EBITDA margin at some level, and we feel a responsibility to deliver a certain amount of EBITDA margin for the business. I feel like that forces us into a set of good habits. At the same time, we feel like it's still fairly early days with the deployment of Internet of Things. We've got lots of growth opportunities in front of us, places we can broaden the platform to take advantage of other segments. And therefore, we lean towards making rational growth investments and we'll do that in the near term, next couple of years, at the expense of absolutely optimizing what we could do with EBITDA margin.
Steve Valenzuela: Nikolay, I would add - this is Steve Valenzuela. If you look at for the guidance we provided for the year, we're coming in at 20.5% EBITDA margin, which is actually right within our long-term target we laid out at the time of the IPO about 2 years ago. At that point, we had indicated the target margin, EBITDA margin of about 20%, 25%.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Well, Steve Valenzuela, I'm hoping you can remind us a little bit on the pricing impact and the ultimate impact on your business model as you get higher attach rate from things like video doorbell. Maybe you can just walk us through how at the consumer level the pricing model changes and how they get passed through your P&L with an impact to ARPU by your distribution channel?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. Gabriela, it's Steve Valenzuela. Steve Trundle will probably add in here as well. But I think the way we look at this is the video attachment certainly is a positive. It certainly draws attraction and retention for - to the subscribers. We don't look at it necessarily as a driver of ARPU by itself because there are different levels of layers of different pricing models that we have. But it's, overall, it's a net positive, maybe slightly up in ARPU. But typically, ARPU is not the key guiding measure for us in terms of a metric.
Stephen Trundle: So I think I would just reiterate what Steve said, which is, yes, higher attach on video is good for business. In addition to - the more value we're providing to the consumer at the end of the day, the more pricing power we have. At the same time, we have to recognize that we're in a competitive market and the consumer has choices, and we need to make sure that our service providers remain very competitive. So we try to sort of juggle those 2 requirements of shifting up ARPU versus keeping our service providers competitive. But you can think about it as opening up another window of opportunity for us to broaden the footprint of the application. There are things you can do with video data that we couldn't do solely with sensor data, so we like the deployment on that front. And it definitely kind of gives us a positive contributor to helping us maintain or, in some cases, slightly increase ARPU.
Gabriela Borges: That's very helpful color. And as a follow-up, if I may. Steve Trundle, I'd love to get your updated thoughts on competition and particularly whether you see anything incremental out of Comcast. The other pieces that I want to get a little more color on was, as you get more video discussion amongst nontraditional competitors or other tech companies, can you look back and maybe expand your TAM from the 23 million households that traditionally bought security services, that's maybe something bigger than 23 million?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. So those are 2 distinct questions. I particularly like the second one. But with the first one related to Comcast specifically, Comcast continues to be a solid competitor in the market. In the areas they service, they compete with our service providers aggressively. They are good marketers and they have a base of subscribers to market to. So I think in their last quarterly call, they portrayed that they continue to make progress in the home security and automation market. And we definitely continue to see them as a competitor to our service providers and therefore, a competitor to us. We're not seeing them as much really in what I would characterize as more as a wholesale or B2B market yet. I think they're focused on that application as a lever in their business. And to some degree, a little bit more in the cable industry than on the market we service - the capability needs that we service, or the capability needs of the type of service provider we do business with are quite a bit different than the capability needs of a typical MSO. So that's what we see there. With regards to the second question, it's a question that I don't think - and I'll rephrase the question which is, with the competition we're seeing from new entrants and others that are bringing IP video solutions directly to the consumer typically for self-install, are we seeing that more as competition or more as a gateway to a bigger TAM? And I don't think we actually know the answer to that question. I think we can be optimistic that people who have become acclimated to observing their property remotely will, at some point, want the highest quality solution they can put their hands on. And I think the highest quality solution will come from an Alarm.com service provider. So in that regard, you could argue that what we currently characterize as competition, something like a camera coming from a company that may sell it through retail is, in fact, TAM expanding. But I think it's too early for us to say that definitively. It would be an optimistic case, but not something we can state as actually being certain at this point.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bhavan Suri with William Blair.
Bhavanmit Suri: I guess, maybe to both Steves. But maybe Steve Trundle, I'll ask first. You're focused a lot more and you talked how much it is than a lot more around commercial. And you've outlined the markets about $4 million - or 4 million properties or opportunities or locations, I should say. A little bit of color, I guess, would be great in sort of - given sort of your incremental conversations around that, are you seeing a faster go-to-market there? Are you seeing acceleration in adoption there because of the video products and the analytics offerings in that space? How is that market different? We've talked about some of the dealers having the same space, sort of it feels like you're more excited about that market. I just love to get a little more color about why and are you seeing sort of business there accelerate?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. I don't know if I would say we're more excited about it, except that it's a vector of growth for us. It's a market we haven't done a great job servicing historically. It does represent - if you define our North American TAM as monitor security and you pile on another 4 million to 5 million monitored properties, you do get 20%, 25% TAM expansion there, which is attractive to us. I think that we're updating on that because we have made some R&D investments there that are long term in nature that we think will yield results over time. The other reason to expect there in this particular segment is when we look rest of world, I often try to look at things that we're doing domestically and then assess whether their impact rest of world is higher than here in the U.S. or lower than in the U.S. under that premise that at some point, whatever we do here will follow into the rest of world market. And when you look rest of world, commercial is a more meaningful chunk of the addressable TAM. Rest of world, even that it is here in North America. I think North America, if we define TAM as market security, which probably is a little bit of a narrow definition, but residential's pretty solid here versus rest of world. But when you get rest of world on commercial, we think the TAM is meaningfully bigger than it is here in the U.S. So we want to make sure we're preparing ourselves with the right capabilities to, over a long period of time, grow in that domain as well. But we are seeing growth. I think we're seeing - we're figuring it out as we go. We've got a nice set of products now. We've enhanced those this past quarter. We've got some additional enhancements that we're working with our service providers to define and bring out before the year-end, and therefore, are pleased to indicate that we think it's something that will continue to help us meet our growth objectives.
Bhavanmit Suri: That's helpful, Steve. I guess, one quick follow-up. The 2 things you point out different a little bit was commercial and then Piper. We've discussed Piper in the past you should have said ""we'll see how that plays out."" DIY, the WiFi connection, the competitive nature in that space between Apple and potentially, Amazon and Google and others is interesting. But you've obviously focused on Piper and you brought up Piper. Just a little bit on how you're thinking about attacking that space. DIY historically has been a space that you guys sort of said, it's interesting, but we're sort of really focused on dealer channel. I'd just love to understand, again, a little more color in sort of the way you did with commercial about why that seems interesting now and sort of the differentiation that Alarm brings to that space vis-à-vis, say, 6 to 12 months ago.
Stephen Trundle: Sure. Yes. So this quarter, I haven't yet said anything about Piper, but I will go ahead get started. As folks know, Piper is 1 of the 2 business units that we acquired from Icontrol on March 8. Business has been focused historically on a retail-based, all-in-one monitoring product sold direct-to-consumer. We've had a few months now to acclimate ourself with the business and with the team. We like the team. The business, as it relates to their current product, will continue to sort of operate as is. Longer term, though, my conviction is still around the service provider channel, and therefore, when I look at how we allocate R&D investment dollars, I tend to favor my conviction. And therefore, I would expect that with Piper on a going-forward basis, we're hoping to take a lot of the talent that exists there and continue to operate what they have today for the foreseeable future. But we allocate some of the forward-looking focus on elements that we believe can be more synergistic with our global service provider channel. So that's where we're headed there.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Koban with Raymond James.
Mike Koban: This is Mike on for Tavis McCourt. I just had a couple kind of housekeeping questions, to be honest. I think you guys had said or suggested in the past that Connect and Piper or maybe just Connect - This is going to be my question. I think you suggested that it would contribute about mid-30s million dollars to revenue per year. Can you confirm that or set me straight?
Steve Valenzuela: Mike, this is Steve Valenzuela. At the time of the acquisition, we gave a 12-month forward look, if you will, of about $33 million to $37 million just for Connect for the following 12 months from the acquisition.
Mike Koban: Okay, okay. Great. And then, Mike, is there - are you expecting any kind of seasonality out of that? Or is it fairly consistent?
Steve Valenzuela: It's fairly consistent. But I think at the time when we gave this guidance, we did say that's over 12 months and you should expect a ramp-up, so it's not going to be linear.
Mike Koban: Got it. Great. And then finally, just on the tax rate the - for this year it blipped in a little bit. Would you mind walking me through what happened with the tax rate this quarter? And what's your kind of forecasting or incorporating in your forecast for the full year?
Steve Valenzuela: You're really going to make me do that? I will say I'll turn it over to Steve Trundle. Just kidding. Yes, so you're probably familiar. There's a number of things going on in Q2. One thing that's going on in Q2 is the adoption of the employee share-based payments to the new accounting standard. And I won't get into all of the accounting. But effective for January 1 for all companies, some companies have early adopted, we adopted January 1. It basically means each quarter, you effectively have to take into consideration your employee stock exercises and you have to take the tax benefit of that in the quarter that the employee exercised stock. So in Q2, we did have a lot of employee exercises. We had some in Q1 as well, so that was part of the reason for the $4.5 million tax benefit in Q2. Also, as we said in the press release and in my script as well, we did also have the benefit from R&D tax credits. We have a benefit both that goes back to 2016 that we trued up as well as the additional R&D tax credits for 2017. And that's really factored on the amount of R&D that we're investing, and we've been doing a very good job of growing our R&D. So we're able to take advantage of that through the tax credit, if you will, tax benefit. And then in terms of your second part of that question, which is what's the outlook for the tax rate for the year. I need to say that as we indicated as well, the employee share-based payments will cause the tax rate to vary from quarter-to-quarter. If we look at the tax rate for the rest of the year, just based on the end of Q2, we're projecting about a favorable tax rate of about 15%. So it's essentially a negative or a minus 15%, which is actually a positive. Now keep in mind, that's not going to be the actual tax rate too because there will be additional employee share-based kind of benefits throughout the second half of the year, which will change the tax rate. But just as we modeled it at the end of Q2, given what we knew then, we're projecting about a favorable 15% tax rate for the year. So hopefully, that helps you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.
Jeffrey Kessler: One of the things that is going on with - in the public and private companies that I cover in your business is the movement on their part toward trying to report more and more in terms of Pre-SAC EBITDA and less emphasis on things like a steady state in operating cash flow even though the bankers will continue to use it and RMR because there's profitable and unprofitable RMR. But Pre-SAC EBITDA implies much - a lot of emphasis on the services side of the business of these companies. How are they - how efficient are they, how longer are they keeping their customers, et cetera, et cetera. What are you doing to move along with your clients as these types of metrics are becoming more important in the way they are going to be judged in their business. You're going to be on the spot, to some extent, to help them make those numbers look better. And you, obviously, are involved in doing that because they depend on you.
Stephen Trundle: Yes. Excellent question, and it really gets to the gist of why you need a solid platform to provide reasonable service to the service providers. If they're attempting to optimize on Pre-SAC EBITDA, then there are a few drivers. You mentioned a couple. One is you drive attrition down or whatever you can do to drive attrition down is helpful. On that front, we have launched the business intelligence offering, we've had that out for a while, trying to give them a much more transparency into the levels of engagement with the customer base. And from that, the customer's propensity to pay, if you have a customer that's not engaged, it's not atypical for that customer to make a call and say, hey, I'm not using this. Can I terminate? Oftentimes, the happy medium is customer may not terminate, but may sign up for a lower rate, which, of course, would affect their performance. So we want to try to help them on that front. We launched Customer Connections, which I referenced in my remarks about a year, a little over a year ago. Have seen nice uptake there. That gives us a tool whereby we can actually, on behalf of the service provider, reach out and touch on a periodic basis with a personalized message, all of the service providers subscribers and keep them aware of all the changes that we're making each week to the platform to make it better, again, with the goal of driving more engagement. And then the last I haven't spoken about recently, but as you talked to others in the industry, a lot of it gets to how efficiently can they actually service their customers. So how efficiently when a call comes in at 8 p.m. at night with someone that has a control panel that's beeping, can they handle that? Do they need to escalate it? Roll a truck? Or can you log into a mobile app from your home if you're a service provider and make a configuration change to the control panel such that, that issue goes away. One is far more efficient. One approach than the other, and one approach yields a happier customer than the other. And luckily, we, from day 1, have focused pretty heavily on how we would service the customer ourselves if we were in the shoes of our service provider. And that's driven us to create a lot of remote management capabilities. And we expose those capabilities directly to our service providers through something we call our FX and through an application we call Mobile Tech, but we also expose it through a set of API. So going forward, as we deal with larger and larger customers, taking more of that functionality and exposing it through interfaces that their staff can directly operate against using whatever internal application they may use interface to their customers is a big part of our focus? And I think that also will help them with the Pre-SAC EBITDA metric. So that's a little bit of color on that, Jeff, but if there's something else, I can try to hit it as well.
Jeffrey Kessler: Sure. I can get you later on other things. Another, I think you call it buzzword, but another thing that is now being discussed in the industry going way past just your - going with just your clients is a notion of a, we'll call it a curated home automation system, one that essentially is much more integrated, one in which is built upon one app working well with the next app, working well with the next app. And I'm wondering what you're doing in that regard to provide your clients with a much more, let's call, a - but we'll call it a ""curated system.""
Stephen Trundle: Right. No, and that's always - on that front, we're sort of trying to do what we've always done, but do it better. We've always had the view that what we put out is a curated home automation ecosystem, whereby each product that we integrate with works with the other products that we also support seamlessly through a single app. So we're not huge fans of making the user switch from app to app. Use this app if you want to open your garage door. Use this app if you want to control your security system. And there's multiple reasons for that. But one is that each time you force them into different application environment, the customer needs to redundantly replicate all their contact information their alerts don't work together. If my garage door is on a different app, then my security system, it's hard to make the garage door closed. When I arm the security system, things of that nature. So we do view that it - has a view that it should all work together and because of that, we're forced to be selective on the hardware that we add to the ecosystem to sort of maintain that state. As we go forward, I think that there's always an opportunity to do that better. So that sounds relatively easy to provide that curated ecosystem, but the consumer is demanding more and more devices and control of more and more things. So there's kind of constant pressure to add to the ecosystem. And every time you add, you're sort of exponentially increasing the test load of making sure that all of this can work together, and that's why you're seeing us continue to invest in R&D, so that we're at a fairly solid pace. So that we can make sure we're able to bring that to consumer. But that's a level of differentiation that we hope that we can fulfill and that we can enable our service providers to message with confidence.
Jeffrey Kessler: Okay. If you've been involved with - you've been involved with Verizon on their G4 LTE program for now sometime. What type of traction are you getting with any of your customers to have them get up to a G4 level, and in doing so, increase the encryption and the, what I call, the hardness of their security, so that the buzzword of security hacking home systems gets a little bit harder to do when you get into a higher-end system - higher-end communications protocol like this.
Stephen Trundle: Right. So the adoption of LTE is - has been pretty fast of late. A lot of service providers, some of the larger ones, have almost mandated that all installations be 4G. And they're doing that - at the moment, I would say less for the encryption benefit and more for the life of account benefits. With 4G, obviously, the half-life of that offering is essentially longer, gets us out at least a decade, probably essentially longer. So we're seeing a shift there. It's a place where we led the market. I think even today, some of our competitors are not out with a solid LTE offering. So we've been pushing it and it's being adopted. With regard to hardening the security system itself, most of the capabilities that we enable through LTE are capabilities that we, in some form, have historically enabled as well So I think the wireless connection has always been a fairly robust and hard connection. I think a lot of the things you may see in the press are related to the RF, between the sensor and the control panel, where we've seen evidence of playback attacks, of breaking into an encrypted sensor communications. And most of that effort or onuses not necessarily on our shoulders, but is instead on the shoulders of our control panel partners. And I think the service providers are gradually demanding that the sensors and peripherals that they deploy speak with a RF that, that is hardened so that they don't have sort of the PR risk of an attack that could come if that's not all encrypted. So that's kind of what we're seeing. That drives us to support more panels, more receivers. But the wireless piece between the control panel and ourselves has always been pretty hard.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Gearhart with First Analysis.
David Gearhart: I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the HVAC channel, the Building 36 product and what you're seeing there in terms of leveraging that channel to sell more smart home products.
Stephen Trundle: Sure. This is Steve speaking. So it continues to be a focus. And I expect sometime over the next 3 or 4 quarters, I'll highlight the effort there. During the past quarter, we added, I believe, in the ballpark of 20-or-so HVAC companies as partners, so we're continuing to work to build kind of an early partner base. We've got a new flavor of the thermostat that's important to that channel coming out the second half of the year and some analytics as well that strengthen the offering there. So I would say at the moment, we're getting nice, early traction. You take a couple steps forward and you learn about a capability that's necessary to really get the offering down in for the channel. So we take a step back and we reengineered it to drive that capability. Here, we're creating a category that hasn't existed. So there's not some other offering out there that we can kind of take hints from or attempt to replicate. We're working directly with those in the field that service that market to really gather their requirements and perfect the offering as we go. So haven't taken off to the point that it's material contributor yet to the business, but continues to be a channel, particularly given the TAM dynamics there that we're enthusiastic about. And then we're also enthusiastic about it because of the synergies with what we do on the EnergyHub side of the business where we have found ways to monetize the connectivity that we deliver for purposes of gaining more transparency and also control of energy use in the residential sector. So continuing to work on it. No big updates this quarter.
David Gearhart: And in my last question, I just wanted to ask about the hardware side of the business. Nice result this quarter, but if you look at guidance, it implies a lower result for the second half. Just wondering if any significant orders pushed from Q3 into Q2 or is it a result of the product updates with the Slim Line version or anything else that we should think about or is it just conservative on your part just given the visibility there less than the SaaS side of things.
Stephen Trundle: No, I think we did see good sales of hardware in the quarter in Q2, and we did say that surpassed our expectations. Keep in mind, the summer months, our service providers partners tend to deploy a lot of hardware, a lot of new installations. And so it's very possible some of the cameras made have been pulled forward into Q2. So I think our guidance we provided for hardware for the year we're comfortable with, and I think it's right in line with what we're expecting at this point in time.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.
Brad Reback: Can you give us a sense if the Icontrol and the core alarm business on the subscription side are growing at the same rate?
Stephen Trundle: Are they growing at the same rate? I don't actually have that data in front of me, but I would say that switches there are small things that are occurring all the time that kind of make it not particularly productive to attempt to segment them, meaning as an example, we have a couple of ADT dealers that have adopted Alarm.com. They were - would normally have used Connect, but I think, for whatever reason, they adopted Alarm.com. And whether we treat them as something that we inherited with the acquisition or whether we treat that as Alarm.com segment revenue, I think could be debated. Likewise, on the P1 side, we've seen P1 make a few changes to how they manage branches, which has driven some higher use of Connect. So I don't actually - I'm not sure I know the exact answer to that. But I would say as we look forward, there will be more and more places where some shift makes sense and it's logical, and therefore, we're going to focus on the overall SaaS number.
Brad Reback: Great. And then just one follow-up. Just to try to avoid any potential confusion, was Icontrol about $8 million in the quarter?
Steve Valenzuela: So this is Steve Valenzuela. We didn't breakout Icontrol, but we did indicate that again if you look at that range, the $33 million to $37 million for Connect during the quarter, right? So when you say Icontrol, what we're talking about really is Connect. And so Connect we have indicated for 12 months following the acquisition about $33 million to $37 million. But again, that's not linear, right? So we haven't really broken that out. We haven't really intending to break that out.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi with Roth Capital.
Darren Aftahi: Just 2, if I may. You've mentioned the Customer Connections program in the PR. I'm just kind of curious if you could talk about any tangible benefit you're seeing, I guess, one with retention; and two, is there any kind of lift on any particular product service you'd call out.
Stephen Trundle: Sure. I think we are seeing early indications that Customer Connections helps with both retention and upsell, so things that are easy, particularly for the consumer. There are 2 categories of things we may position to the customer via Customer Connections. One would be things they can add to the system themselves and others will be things that their service provider can come out and offer to them. So certain products like an indoor camera might be something that a consumer can add to their system, particularly if they already subscribed to video themselves. And other products like a well-installed outdoor camera would be something their service provider would come out and add to the system. And as people add to the system, they're investing in their security in the automation and the overall installation. And as the investment goes up, we think the retention characteristics also improve. So we think it's an important service that allows us to, in some way, do something that a lot of our smaller service providers wouldn't easily be able to do for themselves. And that is digitally maintain communication with their subscribers. And we think over a long period of time that it will help on both fronts, upsells and retention.
Darren Aftahi: Great. And then, I guess, secondly, so you called out the last few quarters strength in video products, doorbell, outdoor, indoor. Just kind of curious, you guys have owned video objects. You mentioned analytics and a lot of the releases you guys put out. Just any strategic update there, and how it kind of fits to kind of the broader umbrella strategy of video going forward?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. Good question. So in the first quarter, we announced that we had acquired ObjectVideo. And ObjectVideo's business was about video analytics. That's what they do. We added that team to our R&D team, and we have not yet put out functional upgrades specifically coming from that effort, but we are working feverishly with that team integrated with our video team to put out a set of analytic capabilities for both residential and commercial installations. But nothing tangible to report today.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jack Vander Aarde with The Maxim Group.
Jack Vander Aarde: This is Jack working with Nehal. Can you just - I know we talked about video penetration rates earlier, but I was wondering if you could give a sense of what percentage of the Alarm subscribers have a non-Alarm video-based hardware product. And then, I guess, from there, what percentage of those non-Alarm hardware subscribers are also integrating in Alarm video service that went into the platform?
Stephen Trundle: Okay, Jack, this is Steve Trundle. It's hard for me to - since we don't have any real data I can rely upon on what our service providers may be finding in a home that's not Alarm.com product. We have pretty good data on, obviously, on the Alarm.com products that are connected, but I would only be hazarding a guess on frequency that they're encountering third-party video hardware. So I don't think I can actually answer that question. I would say we occasionally hear from a service provider that they go into a property and they already have some type of video product. And we have to actually explain to the customer why our product is superior and why integration with the rest of the home security apparatus and the home automation system makes sense and then replace that hardware. But I don't - I can't tell you with any degree of certainty how frequently that's occurring. So I apologize for that, but...
Jack Vander Aarde: No, that's fair. Not the way I expected, but I just wanted to see if I could get a sense, but no worries there. That's it for my questions and congrats on a great quarter.
Stephen Trundle: Okay. Thanks, Jack.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jonathan Schaffer with the Blueshirt Group. Sir, you may begin.
Jonathan Schaffer: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alarm.com's 2017 third quarter earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Joining us today from Alarm.com are Steve Trundle, President and CEO; and Steve Valenzuela, CFO. Before we begin, a quick reminder to our listeners. During today's call, management may make forward-looking statements, which may include projected financial results or operating metrics, business strategies, anticipated future products and services, anticipated investment and expansion, anticipated market demand or opportunities and other forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs, and on information currently available to us. Statements containing words such as anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, may, will and other similar statements are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the Risk Factors section of our most recent quarterly earnings report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and subsequent reports that we file with the SEC, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from the results or timing predicted or implied by such forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please note that these forward-looking statements made during this conference call speak only as of today's date, and Alarm.com undertakes no obligation to update them, to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, other than to the extent required by law. Also during this call, management's commentary will include non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP guidance. Management believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use, in understanding company performance and trends, but note that the presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in the financial statement tables of our earnings press release, which we have posted to our Investor Relations web site, at investors.alarm.com. This conference call is being web cast and is also available on our Investor Relations web site. The web cast of this call will be archived on our web site, and a telephonic replay will be available through November 15. So with these formalities out of the way, I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Trundle. You may begin.
Steve Trundle: Thanks Jonathan and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. I am pleased to report that we continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter. Our SaaS and license revenue was $61.9 million. This is an increase of 39% from a year ago. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $19.5 million, up 65% from a year ago. Turning to the business updates; we are coming off another successful partner summit. This is a three day event that we hold each October. We invite both our service provider partners and our ecosystem partners. At the event, we present our latest products and services, providing glimpse of our R&D roadmap clarities, and discuss market trends. Most importantly, the partner summit provides our team, an opportunity to hear from our service providers and how our solutions are performing in the market. Most of our service providers are doing very well, and heard about particular strength from our large base of smaller and highly local dealers. These folks sometimes describe themselves as even being too busy. The average customer is feeling better about the economy, as evidenced by last week's report, that the consumer confidence index has reached its highest level since December of 2000. This increased consumer confidence is beginning to drive more builder activity, and our smaller dealers often have a number of local builder relationships. Increased confidence, along with better technology is also causing the typical customer to purchase a bigger smartphone system, than was the case a couple of years ago. Our smaller dealers tend to perform well in an environment, where the customers wants a larger system, with a more highly customized installation. So we are seeing strength there. My overall take from talking to our service providers, is that customer demand for a cleanly installed and complete smartphone system, powered by Alarm.com, remains strong. The timing of our partner summit also gave me the opportunity to speak to our service providers, engage their reactions to the competitive new products, that have hit store shelves ahead of the Christmas retail season. I do not sense that any of our service providers were overly concerned, as they have long seen similar retail kit offerings in the marketplace. Our customers generally prefer the peace of mind, convenience, and most importantly, the security that comes from a complete solution, that is professionally installed and supported by our security service provider. My conversations also reinforce that our R&D investments are focused on the right areas for our service providers and their customers. We laid out a number of roadmap initiatives to create new user experiences, enable more capable video based services, and generate additional growth in the smarter business category. As we deliver these capabilities to our service providers over the next 12 months, we will talk about some of them further on these calls. I also want to highlight a few of the capabilities that we released with the platform during the third quarter. We added two-way audio functionality to our indoor residential cameras. We also released updates to both our mobile and our Apple TV applications. We further differentiated our video doorbell solution, by taking advantage of integration opportunities, that only exist, when a single holistic platform underlies the smart home. Alarm.com doorbell users can now see who is at the door, speak to that person, and then temporarily disarm the security system and unlock the door, all from a single interface. We also added humidity control to our thermostat solution. Leveraging humidity sensors already on the Alarm.com smart thermostat, subscribers can now create a set point for both the temperature and the humidity level in their property. Alarm.com intelligently balances the two set points to automatically provide comfort and efficiency, while also maintaining an environment, that will help prevent mold formation. This feature will especially benefit customers to use Alarm.com for second homes or multiple business locations. And as most of you know, we also focus heavily on delivering partner tools and applications that our service providers use to more effectively service their Alarm.com subscribers. We are also making some nice enhancements in this area. We are introducing a new video camera installation tool, that intelligently guides installers through the camera setup process, by automatically adapting the factors, such as the wireless network environment, and the experienced level of the technician. A less experienced tech will be walked through some basic initial steps during installation, and these steps will be skipped, when guiding more experienced technicians. These types of tools, when combined with our turning program, are allowing us to help our service providers gain confidence and become more efficient, when installing and servicing more complete smart home and smart business systems. On the training side, we have seen dealer participation in the Alarm.com academy, increase 140% over the last year. For the last couple of years, we have also operated our Alarm.com certified technician program. Techs who complete nine core required courses, are able to earn their certified technician badge. To-date, more than 3,000 service technicians have completed this full training curriculum, and are actively servicing the market, as Alarm.com certified technicians. There are two reasons we focus so heavily on both service tools and training for our service providers. We want to reduce the likelihood, that an end subscriber needs service, but make sure that when they do, our service providers are well equipped to efficiently respond. This year, we have seen a positive confirmation that we are making progress on these goals. Our service providers have continued to increase the attachment rate of advanced devices on systems they install, while our support call volume on a per installed device is on pace to drop about 20%. The increase in attachment rate of advanced devices is being driven by both new and existing accounts. We defined advanced devices as either home automation devices, like smart thermostats, locks and lights; or any type of video camera. The attachment rate of advanced devices on new accounts created in the third quarter, increased 17% over the same period last year. We are also seeing the base of Alarm.com subscribers, gradually add new devices to their already installed systems. This has been particularly true with video. Among the cohort of subscriber accounts that were created in 2015 and that have video services today, nearly 30% added video services to their system, sometime after the initial installation. This is evidence that our service providers are moving to take advantage of opportunities to increase the lifetime value of their customers, who are serviced by our platform, and this is a positive trend for our business. In summary, I am pleased with the results, that the Alarm.com team and our service provider partners delivered during the third quarter. We made solid progress, expanding our platform, to extend our leadership position in the smart home space, while continuing to produce consistent financial results. And with that, I will hand things over to Steve Valenzuela. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I will begin with a review of our third quarter 2017 financial results, and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter and our raised outlook for full year 2017, before opening the call for questions. Starting with our review of the third quarter; SaaS and license revenue grew 39% from the same quarter last year to $61.9 million, which includes the contribution from Connect we acquired March of this year. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high, with a revenue renewal rate of 93% in the third quarter, consistent with our renewal rate last quarter. Hardware and other revenue in the third quarter was $28 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This increase was largely driven by strong sales of our video cameras. As we have mentioned on last quarter's call, we introduced new video cameras and a new version of our video doorbell in the second quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 33% over the same quarter of last year to $90 million. Gross margin for our SaaS and license revenue was 85% for the third quarter, up about 200 basis points from the same quarter last year. Gross margin for hardware and other revenue was 21% for the third quarter, this is up about 50 basis points from Q3 2016, and down about 60 basis points sequentially due to product mix. Total gross margin was 65% for the third quarter, up about 350 basis points from the same quarter last year. The higher gross margin in the third quarter, is due to a combination of the increase in SaaS and license growth margin, and the [indiscernible] mix of SaaS and license revenue, accounting for 69% of total revenue for the third quarter, compared to 66% in the same quarter last year. Turning to operating expenses; R&D expense in the third quarter was $19.3 million compared to $11.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. We ended the third quarter with 443 employees in R&D, up from 304 employees a year ago. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter were $10.4 million or 12% of total revenue, compared to $10.7 million or 16% of total revenue in the same quarter last year. G&A expenses in the third quarter were $13 million, down from $14.8 million in the year ago quarter. G&A expense includes non-ordinary course litigation expense of $1.9 million in the third quarter, compared to $3.1 million in Q3 2016. Non-ordinary course litigation expenses are part of our adjusted measures, and are excluded from our measurement of our non-GAAP financial performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $19.5 million in the third quarter, up 65% from $11.8 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter, GAAP net income was $15.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the year ago quarter. Our tax provision in the third quarter was a favorable benefit to net income in the amount of $5 million. This tax benefit is primarily due to a $6.1 million favorable impact in the third quarter from the new accounting standard; ASU 2016-09, accounting for employee share based transactions. Under this new accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of 2017, we are required to recognize the tax windfall benefits in the quarter that employees exercise stock options, and this will cause our GAAP effective tax rate to vary from quarter-to-quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was $13.3 million in the quarter, compared to $9.3 million in the third quarter of 2016. We have now excluded from non-GAAP net income the $6.1 million tax windfall benefit I just discussed, resulting from employee stock exercises, as we do not consider this as part of our operating performance. Excluding the tax windfall benefit, our effective tax rates used to compute our non-GAAP net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, were 23.5% and 27.4% respectively. Turning to our balance sheet; we ended the third quarter with $84.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the third quarter, we generated approximately $13.8 million in cash flow from operations and $11.9 million of free cash flow. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we generated $31 million of free cash flow, up from $5.4 million for the same nine month period in 2016. On October 6, shortly after the end of the quarter; we replaced our existing debt facility with a new facility, increasing our loan capacity to $125 million, up from our prior facility of $75 million. This new debt facility provides us increased flexibility at reduced interest rates. Our debt balance remains unchanged at $72 million, as we have not done any additional borrowings under the new facility. The term is for five years to October 2022, replacing our prior revolver, this term was set to expire November 2018. In addition to our existing banks, which are Silicon Valley Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we added JPMorgan and PNC Bank to our banking syndicate. Let me now turn ASC 606, the new revenue accounting standard that we are required to adopt beginning in 2018. We currently plan to implement this new accounting standard, using the modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of reviewing the impact, if any, on our financial results. While we have not finalized our review of our major service provider contracts, we have not identified changes at this time, that we believe, would result in a material impact to our revenue recognition policies for the Alarm.com segment. However, this is still under review. We are also in the process of reviewing our customer contracts for our subsidiary, that we report in our other segment, and assessing if there are any accounting changes for their revenue under 606. Also under 606, we are required to evaluate our commissions expense, and capitalize commissions whose benefit can be attributed to a term that is longer than one year. We currently expense commissions as incurred. We have begun to evaluate our commission agreements, and believe we will need to change the accounting for some of our commissions and amortize them over a term longer than one year. We will report final changes required for the new standard in our 10-K for 2017, that we will file in the first quarter of 2018. Moving to our financial outlook; we expect Q4 SaaS and license revenue of $63.7 million to $63.9 million and we are increasing full year 2017 SaaS and license revenue to be between $234.8 million to $235 million. This compares to our prior outlook for SaaS and license revenue for 2017 of $233.3 million to $233.8 million. We are also raising our guidance for total revenue for 2017 to $332.8 million to $334 million, up from our prior guidance of $326.3 million to $327.8 million. This includes our raised guidance for hardware and other revenue of $98 million to $99 million. We are also increasing our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2017 to be between $68.5 million to $69 million, up from our prior range of $66.5 million to $67.3 million. We are also updating our guidance for non-GAAP net income for 2017, to exclude the impact of the tax windfall benefits, due to employee stock exercises. Excluding this tax benefit, our updated guidance for non-GAAP adjusted net income for 2017 is $43.2 million to $43.7 million, or $0.87 to $0.88 per diluted share, and if the tax windfall was included, then it would have added approximately $12.5 million to 2017's non-GAAP net income, or $0.25 per diluted share. EPS is based on an estimate of 49.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year 2017 stock based compensation expense of $7 million to $7.5 million. Finally, while it is too early to spend much time on 2018, as we still have to execute on the rest of 2017 and report results for the full year, I did want to provide a very early perspective on 2018. Putting aside any changes related to the adoption of ASC 606, the new revenue accounting standard, we are comfortable with total revenue of $375 million to $385 million for 2018, in line with current consensus. We believe we are well positioned to build on our expanding market opportunity for the secured smart property, in both residential and commercial sectors, and we are thankful for a strong base of service provider partners. We will provide our initial guidance for 2018, when we report our fourth quarter and 2017 financial results in the first quarter of 2018. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter, and we are focused on executing on our business strategy, and investing in our growth opportunities, while continuing to deliver solid financial results. Before we open the call to questions, we respectfully request that each person ask only one question per analyst, so that we can accommodate all of our analysts in the time allotted for this call. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And with that operator, please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Nikolay Beliov: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Thank you for the 2018 preliminary revenue guidance. How should we think about the margin profile for 2018 directionally, and what are the puts and takes that you guys are considering, before you provide the actual guidance?
Steve Trundle: Hey Nikolay, this is Steve Trundle. Yeah, as you look to 2018, or at least as we look at it, I have said this before, the margin profile is something we have quite a bit of control of. So it's really a business decision, more than it is something, where we are reacting to any particular sales activity. And currently, I think what you are saying is a little bit of a drift. We have talked about a long term range in the 20% to 25% sort of bucket, and we have been drifting up the pad, and I would imagine that type of a trend may stay intact. But we will be looking for ways that we can invest to maintain the growth rate. So we are not going to pull too hard at this time on the margin lever.
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah, with the 2017 guidance, we are coming at a 20.6% adjusted EBITDA, and that's up from 19% in 2016. So you have seen us over the last three years, every year, the adjusted EBITDA has gone up. Not to say, we continue at that rate. Just to be clear.
Nikolay Beliov: Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thank you, Nikolay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Alex Hu: Hey guys, this is Alex Hu on for Michael Nemeroff. Congrats on the really strong results and thanks for taking our question. Steve T., just curious, as you look at your business over the next let's say, 12 to 18 months. Among the initiatives you just commented on or have in place, whether it be new products, services international opportunity, the commercial channel, integration of Icontrol, like what excites you the most? What do you think could potentially drive the largest near term upside and maintain the momentum we have seen since our IPO? And how is Alarm positioned to capitalize on that opportunity versus some of your peers? Thanks.
Steve Trundle: Thanks Alex. Good question. I get excited about a lot of things, but I would say, my roots are in technology. So I get probably most excited about the pipeline right now that we have and the enthusiasm that our partners, our service providers have expressed for that pipeline. So I alluded to some of this in my prepared comments, things we are doing with -- to improve the -- really, really improved video experience. Things we are doing to drive some new user experience is up, and things we are doing to expand the growth opportunities that our service providers have in the small business category. So in each of those cases, there is some interesting new development that we are investing in and we are excited about. At the same time, some of the other things you alluded to, the ongoing work that we and the Icontrol team are doing, to support the base of customers that we inherited with that acquisition. Still has a lot of opportunity that I hope to be able to seize upon in the next 12 to 24 months. And then international is still an area where we are growing, each month, seeing some growth there, and I say that and the business hasn't totally kicked in yet internationally yet either. As I have said in the past, it's profitable on a P&L basis, but as one of the major components of the growth, it's not there yet. So I see some reason to sort of be excited and look forward to driving more activity there next year.
Alex Hu: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Gabriela Borges: Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the solid results. For Steve Trundle, if you don't mind, coming into the year, we talked about on organic growth rate being in the upper teens, and now with the initial look into 2016, coming in right around the mid to high teens levels, would love to get your thoughts on organic normalized growth rates in the core business in the U.S. Where do you feel we are, with respect to the S-curve, in terms of adoption on the home security, smart security side? Is the S-curve even the right way to look at it, or any high level thoughts to normalize growth from here would be helpful? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Yeah. So I think, yeah you are pointing out [ph] sort of how we are looking at 2018 and in terms of where we are in the S-curve. I think, obviously the company is bigger than it was last year. We have absorbed the material acquisition that we are growing off of at this point as well. As you get bigger, you will see some temperance of the overall growth, that you are growing off of a larger base. But if we look kind of at the overall market, I think one way we had been asked about it in the past, is sort of what inning are we in. And I think if we look at sort of the percentage of homeowners putting business aside for a moment, if we just look sort of residential, and extrapolate out where we are in terms of the adoption cycle, I think it's reasonable to assume that, at least when we talked about our service providers that all security subscribers will be smartphone subscribers at some point in the future, and that's very much the trendline, it's intact. There may be a handful, who don't -- believe it or not, don't use mobile devices, and therefore are happy with the technology that has existed for the last 30 years. But for the most part, at least what we are seeing as we talk to service providers, everyone is adopting smartphone, and yet, if we look at Parks [ph] data and data from other sources, we are probably only about one-third penetrated at the moment, within that kind of narrowly defined TAM. So I would say, we are probably third to fourth inning, if we use that as sort of a basis, and then once we fully penetrate sort of existing TAM, if we assume no TAM expansion, then we will see those -- we will reach sort of a steady state. But we also believe that the TAM will continue to grow, and then of course, we are doing some things around the edges to expand our addressable market as well, and those are very early inning type of initiatives.
Gabriela Borges: Absolutely. Thank you for the color.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open.
Matt Pfau: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to maybe get a better understanding in terms of -- Steve, you talked about how you are seeing or at least your dealers are seeing the demand for more customized expanded smart home deployments. How has this impacted your ARPUs that you are receiving per customer, if at all? And then I guess, as you think about the business longer term, should we expect to see an improvement in retention rates or any other sort of material financial changes from that trend? Thanks.
Steve Trundle: Yeah. Good question Matt. Yeah, definitely as we -- I think I alluded particularly to the very local dealers that are benefitting from a lot of larger, sort of customized installations, and certainly in our case, when a customer adds video services to their solution, that's a higher ARPU customer, than a customer that is just taking sort of smart home without video. We don't try to push a lot of ARPU on what I would call traditional home automation types of capabilities. So someone that wants to be able to tie their lights to their security system, that's not really an ARPU generator, that's just a convenience feature, that we think adds to customer stickiness. So on that front, it's not a big ARPU driver. On the video piece it is. What we are seeing in general, is yes, it's helping us maintain ARPU probably very slight increase in ARPU. But I look at it more as a way to provide more value for the same price. The service providers are telling us they are in a very competitive market. The customer is looking to get value for their dollar. And we therefore, in support of service providers, look to provide more value for sort of the same relative costs, and I would call the -- sort of the increase in services that we are seeing, give this away to kind offset some discounting and other things that we do, to try to make sure that the service provider still have high value offering in the marketplace. So that's kind of how those are working together, I would say. Then some of the activity on the side, with small business and otherwise, also help us drive a little bit of ARPU growth.
Matt Pfau: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Julian Serafini: Hi, this is Julian Serafini on for John DiFucci. I had a question about something that Steve Trundle talked about a little bit earlier. You had talked about some of the small resource providers. And I guess I was wondering on your new customer acquisition; would you say that most of your new customers that are coming from these small resource providers instead of the bigger ones, who seem to be, I guess, struggling a little bit in terms of customer additions in the marketplace, is that a fair assessment or like could you quantify, I guess, like where your customers are coming from?
Steve Trundle: Hey Julian. It's a good follow-up. So yeah, the larger service providers are still doing well, and I didn't mean to discount sort of their effectiveness in the market, if I did. But in terms of our mix, I mean, the way we look at it is, the folks I was referring to today, would be sort of about 40% of our new account production. These would be folks that are either highly local or regional, and have been a source of strength. And then the larger players still represent about 60% of our new account production.
Julian Serafini: Okay, thank you. That was helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Tavis McCourt: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve V., I just had a couple of follow-ups for you on the accounting front. So if I look at the Q4 guide, it looks like the non-GAAP tax rate you are using is something approaching a 100%, if I am reading that right, I guess, a confirmation of that. And then what should we be using as a go forward GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate with the stock option tax changes? And then secondly, thanks for the clarification on 606, and I guess, I just wanted to confirm that I heard it right. As of this time, we don't expect a material change, but you may end up capitalizing some commission expenses, but I guess, what you are saying is, that's probably small enough not to qualify as being material. Is that the right way -- is that the message you are trying to get across?
Steve Valenzuela: Hi Tavis. Good questions by the way. So on the tax rate, I think last quarter, we talked about this new accounting standard for an employee's share based payments and our companies are doing it in many different ways. We really decided that the best way to treat that on a non-GAAP basis, was really to take it out of our tax rate. So if you look at our non-GAAP tax rate for the year, we are projecting about 30% tax rate. For the GAAP tax rate, because of this, employee share based payments now having to go through the P&L, versus how it used to grow through equity, we are projecting a benefit of 39% to 40% benefit tax to GAAP. Now going forward, I would caution that we usually like the model beyond the year at about a 35% tax rate. Now we know there is discussions about a new corporate tax rate, and we can't predict that. But I would say, to be safe, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, I would say to be in the 35% tax rate. So hopefully, that addresses your questions on the tax. And I did want to make sure that to clarify, again, with the guidance for the year for non-GAAP, it is different than what we did last quarter. If we were to include the non-GAAP in our guidance for the year, our non-GAAP net income would have been $56 million and $1.12 per share. So just want to make sure, people understand that. And so I think that covers your questions on the tax. Let me now go to 606; so there is only so many things that I can say at this point without discussing -- clearing [indiscernible]. But I will say that, we have gone through our major service provider contracts on the Alarm.com segment, and we did say that we do not see any material changes at this time. We obviously have to go through an audit. 606 is a huge, huge new accounting standard that is causing a lot of companies to spend a lot of work on, and we are spending a lot of time on it. The good news is, we are accounting for our revenue for our service providers on a ratable basis, and under the prior guidance which is 605, the new guidance 606, is pretty much the same revenue recognition. Now I will caution that to say, we haven't got through the audit yet, so I just want to be careful there. But that's where we believe we are right now. With regard to our other subsidiaries within our other segment, that's less than 6% of our revenue. So we are still working through that, whether or not there will be some change. That will still need to be determined. But again, it's a smaller part of our revenue. The good news is, the major portion of our revenue, we believe, will simply be accounted for under the same methodology we have been doing a lot. Now your last question was on commission; now commissions is one area we are still assessing, but a lot of people don't realize that there is actually a large impact under the new revenue standard for commissions; because as part of 606, you'd have to take your commission's expense, and you'd have to figure out the portion that benefits more than one year, and of course, we incent ourselves in terms of adding new dealers as well as new subscribers. And so those typically -- a good portion of their commissions actually benefit more than a year. So there will be an impact from that. I would not say, it will not be immaterial, it would probably be a significant impact, but will also have to also take back the commissions going back for the contract. So the net effect will be -- will need to determine, there will be some commissions in the prior year, as we move forward. Commissions in the current year, 2018, that will be amortized over a longer period. So the net of all this, is that, there is no change to cash, right? So where cash generation doesn't change, yes our P&L will change a little bit, but the important point is really, from a cash point of view, 606 doesn't impact cash.
Tavis McCourt: Great. And so just to make sure I heard that, on the tax rate for next year, no reason to assume anything different on a non-GAAP basis at this point versus what we were assuming before, which is kind of the mid-30s?
Steve Valenzuela: That's right. I would just assume mid-30s. Now if there is new legislation, we will be happy about that. But I would say to be safe right now, just assume mid-30s.
Tavis McCourt: Great. Thanks a lot.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. Thanks Tavis.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. You talked about some of the services at the edges, which are beginning to impact the revenue of some of your, well basically, some of your smaller and mid-sized service providers, ranging -- and I am assuming, that it ranges everywhere from the beginnings of Telehealth to on the -- if you want to call, on the large scale side and the enterprise side, and as an EnergyHub. Could you go through two or three or four of these products and services at the edges, that you think have the potential to impact, perhaps the second half of 2018 into 2019?
Steve Trundle: Yeah. This is Steve. Steve T.
Jeff Kessler: Hi Steve. Hi Steve.
Steve Trundle: So I was alluding to EnergyHub, which you referenced. I think EnergyHub is kind of on a positive trajectory. So I don't know that it's a trajectory -- we obviously bit of a positive trajectory as well, so it won't be a giant surprise to us, if we keep having progress on some of these things and on the edges, but we have that effort, which is a demand response and really edge device management software platform called Mercury 3, that's out now. And then we talked in the past about our PointCentral business, which is focused on vacation rental properties, as well as MDUs. They continue to make progress, and we think that will continue on next year. We have talked about our HVAC oriented business called Building36. That one is still in it's -- in more nascent phases, but we are hoping to see more progress there over the next 12 months. So those are three other things; and then in the core business, when we think about the smaller service providers. I think expanding the footprint of what we actually bring to market for them. So in particular in the past, I talked about the SMB segment and how traditionally we have been very focused on the residential segment, but how the number of service providers, who service both sides of the markets, we even have homeowners, who also own businesses and have asked for a more innovative experience there. So on that front, that's mostly new, that's not a part of the business that we can model off a historic trajectory, and I think will be contributing to what see next year in sort of the core business.
Steve Trundle: Commercial as well has a -- there was a question about ARPU. Commercial typically has a 2X ARPU to residential. And while we are still early on commercial, it's about 5% or 6% of our subscribers, as we introduce more features, we think there is opportunity there as well.
Jeff Kessler: So at the moment, 5% to 6% of subs are in that basket?
Steve Trundle: Yes, that's right.
Jeff Kessler: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Steve Trundle: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Smith with First Analysis. Your line is open.
Howard Smith: Yes, thank you for taking my question. Good evening. I wanted to ask questions piling up a little bit on Building36 specifically, and you mentioned the new thermostat, our feature with the humidity and the like; and I am curious if that thermostat is in any way tied into Building36, or if you keep those, what you are doing for your traditional security network in Building36 completely separate? Maybe you could address how those might work together or not?
Steve Trundle: No, they do sort of work together. Howard, it's a good question. It's that team that works with actually set of HVAC partners, that designs the thermostat, that designs and implements. For that matter, the thermostat, that works with Alarm.com. On the Alarm.com side of business, we work with a lot of thermostats. So we are willing to work with others, but we have the one that's designed, particularly for service providers to be able to easily install and to work very well, and that's one that is an Alarm.com thermostat really felt by the Building36 team. So a lot of the knowhow actually comes from that team, and they gather that by working directly with the folks that are in the HVAC business. In terms of what the consumer experience is, it is absolutely the case that a consumer that's benefitting from the Building36 service, may at some point say, hey, I'd like to leverage the assets that exist in my home or business. For the purposes of energy management, I'd like to have those assets actually work with my security apparatus. And at that point, that customer would shift more than likely, and go to one of our service providers, and become their customer. But again, using the thermostat that was already installed by the HVAC guys. So it's an effort we have underway to make sure that on some of the core devices like thermostat, we are ceding the market with devices sort of early, and the incarnation of the customer's life, and then creating hopefully downstream opportunities for our service providers to come in and work with some devices that are already integrated in the Alarm.com ecosystem.
Howard Smith: Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thank you, Howard.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Nehal Chokshi: Yeah. Thank you. So I think you have talked about in the past, that there is an opportunity to have ADT push future interactive security subscribers towards that core alarm platform versus the Icontrol platform, so I am talking about the Pulse subscribers in this case? And that would result in an ARPU lift for Alarm, and that the drivers for that decision is better lifetime, at effectively the same cost for ADT, but would represent lift for Alarm. So I have got two questions here, so sorry for the length here; but first, ADT appears to be successfully driving up customer satisfaction, using the Protection1 brand, load of customer service, and thereby the lifetime value. So, is the assertion of higher lifetime value somewhat diminished by this success? I'd like you to address that? And then the second thing is that, given that ADT is focused on reducing costs and thus, pushing alarm for new Pulse subscribers, would likely require similar overall costs of what ADT does, and what ADT pays, when considering all-in. I'd like to understand, how this transition, if it does happen, will be accretive from an operating profit per user to Alarm perspective?
Steve Trundle: Hey, Nehal. So this is Steve T speaking. I may have to break that one into a couple of parts. And obviously, in the case of a specific customer, I can't necessarily present their data. But I think I understand the two parts; first is, your comment that you are seeing from other sources that, customer satisfaction with a large customer of Icontrol, which purchased ADT, is actually on the increase already. And that would be a positive thing, that would be attributable to their effectiveness in operating the business and focusing on customer service. And I think that's -- from what I have heard, that is actually true. I don't think that undermines the likelihood that, providing the customer an even more advanced solution in the future, whether based on the -- what we call the Icontrol connect platform or the Alarm.com platform, I don't -- in both cases, I think, to the extent that we improve the customer experience and deliver ever increasing reliability and capability to the customer, I do believe and data suggests that the lifetime value of the customer will increase even further, because they will use their system more and they will become more sticky. So I don't think whatever that customer may have done to improve customer service thus far, is -- in any way, conflicts with the possibility of driving further lifetime value in the future. I think the second part of your question was about the way that --
Steve Valenzuela: The economics around -- I think that was -- you were asking your question about, if the customer was going to move from Connect or add new subscribers from Connect on to Alarm.com, what the costs would be. And we have talked in the past about this, that with Connect, the customer has to do with the hosting, they have to pay the cellular fees. They have to pay their people, they have all of the support as well. With Alarm.com, our dealers have that provided for them by Alarm.com, so we have talked about the cost difference. The ARPU is obviously higher for Alarm.com, because of all the services that we are covering, we are paying on behalf of the dealers. So I would venture to say, and this is still to be determined, but we feel pretty strong, given the synergies that we have and a large base of subscribers, with customers on Connect, that would add new subscribers on Alarm.com, they would not have to pay these costs that they are currently paying out of pocket for hosting for the data centers, the servers, the telecommunications charges, their support people. So given the synergies, I would venture to say, and I would expect, that the customer would realize some cost synergies and benefits, as well as Alarm.com, so it would be a win-win-win. Of course, Alarm.com's ARPU would go up compared to what Connect customers are currently paying. But again, those customers would have a benefit, we believe, given the synergies.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open.
Dylan Heslin: Hi. This is Dylan on for Darren. Thanks for taking the questions and thanks for some of the colors on fiscal 2018 outlook. Just to sort of add on to that a little bit; could you may be talk about some of your top priorities for 2018 and where you will be investing a little bit? I know you mentioned the margins are ticking up a little bit, they are not quite at that long term range. So just a little bit color on top priority in 2018? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: This is Steve T. speaking. So I think, some of the top priorities will be to continue to build out the businesses that exist in the other segments. We'd also want to continue to look for R&D synergies between the Icontrol business that we acquired, and the Alarm.com business. And when I say, their R&D synergies, they don't necessarily mean reducing R&D spend, what I mean is, delivering even more to the market, looking for ways to avoid redundancy and take advantage of the unique skills that exist at both places. Then we get to sort of in the market; I think you will see us probably refocus a bit on marketing, and in 2018, both what we do in tandem with our service provider partners, and then also, some education of the consumer. So that's a place where we have not focused as much in 2017, that I expect to shift some focus to in 2018. And then executing on the things in the product pipeline, that we are excited about, particularly, that relate to expanding our presence in the small business segment, expanding the capabilities, and therefore, hopefully the attachment of our video offering, and then making sure, we are delivering on our promise to our international customers, that are out there, trying to grow their business, and we certainly have work to do there as well. So those will be -- a few of the areas that I think will be top priorities in 2018.
Dylan Heslin: Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Rishi for Mike. Thanks for taking my call. Could you explain, what caused the sequential decline in SaaS gross margins in the quarter?
Steve Trundle: I am going to let Steve Valenzuela handle that one. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: The SaaS gross margins, you are talking about I think 50 basis points?
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah.
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah. That's a pretty small change quarter-over-quarter. I think keep in mind, in the SaaS business, there is the other segment as well, and there are some timing differences in various programs with our other segments, EnergyHub, PointCentral, and I think that's probably the main driver. But if you look at SaaS, year-over-year the gross margin is up over 200 basis points. So I think it's more of a timing issue. I would expect that SaaS gross margin in the 85% to 86% is a reasonable margin going forward. If you look at a year ago, it was 82%, 83%. So we have seen a nice increase in our SaaS gross margin.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you. There is a lot of talk and a little bit of action, with regard to the increase in the number of, let's call, an increase in the amount that communities are charging for repeated or even first time false alarms, and potential in certain cities, potential increases from the time for responders. If the system -- if the alarm or the incident is not verified, what are you doing, particularly, with some of your smaller providers, to make sure that when verification is needed in those cities that kind of require it, or where police response is really deteriorated, because too many false alarms, because of too much DIY and things like that coming into the mix. What are you doing to start helping them, be able to better verify or provide services that would increase the verification capability?
Steve Trundle: Yeah Jeff, that was a good question. So I think that you are correct, that a number of communities are reacting in kind of an adverse way to the mountain of false alarms, that a lot of these sort of security in a shoebox type of offerings are generating, as folks take home things they bought, at a retail store and try to install it. So we are hearing about that; I think our service providers actually kind -- in kind of an odd way, they actually like seeing a little bit of that dynamic, and because it in some ways, benefits them, it leads the customer back to getting a system from someone that has installed hundreds, if not thousands, and knows how to make sure these things are not generating a ton of false alarms. So it's not necessarily a negative trend. And then it brings us to, like things that are particularly interesting, that we are doing with the product itself. And as an example, a customer can actually see images and/or video from their home, and then acknowledge that the alarm is true or false, directly from their mobile app, before the central station actually ever initiates a dispatch. And in that case, we will generate a cancel back to the central station, and that will flow through and we avoid a lot of the false alarms, especially when we are getting kind of a higher attachment of some of these video elements. And when I say video elements, that kind of brings me on to products I have always been excited about, which is the product we call the image sensor, which is a low cost motion detector that actually includes a camera that takes pictures, anytime it's triggered at an alarm state. And there again, we can get that data -- that contextual data directly to the consumer, and give them an opportunity to call off the alarm and all of that sort of wire. They don't even have to take a phone call, they simply hit the cancel button and the alarm goes away. So I think it's probably good for us. It give us a chance to be innovative. I think doing things, another one that's associating individual sensors. So peripheral sensors with actual cameras, to be able to map that layout, such that when there is an intrusion on a given point in a property, we are getting to the operator in the central station, the video, sort of the right video for that type of intrusion, gives us a place where we can do interesting things with software, to make the whole apparatus better, and hopefully make it -- something that creates less anxiety for the consumer, and so it is a dynamic. It's one that actually think is probably positive for our business, and hopefully an area where we can really help our service providers persist.
Jeff Kessler: Okay. Thank you very much.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.

So with these formalities out of the way, I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Trundle. You may begin.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, Brinlea and welcome to everyone joining our call today. We are pleased to report that the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, closing out a solid 2017. Our SaaS and license revenue in the fourth quarter was $65.2 million, increasing 39% over last year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $22.2 million, increasing 55% over last year. During 2017, we set an ambitious agenda for the company. We worked hard to strengthen our position as the leading engine of innovation for service providers in the smart security space. We also further positioned the company to capture new growth opportunities and expand our participation in other emerging business models enabled by the Internet of Things. I want to thank our service provider partners, our ecosystem partners and our employees who all contributed to our progress in 2017. On today's call, I want to review key developments from last year, highlight some of our recent product announcements and discuss trends we’re seeing in the market. Over the course of 2017, we delivered against a robust product roadmap. We introduced new technology to drive growth opportunities for our service provider partners. For example, we enhanced our video service by delivering support for new indoor and outdoor cameras, including a Slim Line Doorbell Camera. And we added engaging new features to the video experience through updates through our mobile app and web dashboard. During 2017, we also expanded our platform to support a wider slice of the security market. This included expanding our ecosystem of commercial grade security panels and video cameras and introducing a new system enhancement module to facilitate upgrades from traditional systems to our interactive services. Collectively, these new solutions enabled our service provider partners to further appeal to commercial customers. In 2017, we also continued to pioneer increasingly intelligent and adaptive capabilities through our data analytics program. We launched Insights Engine, which is a machine learning capability that automatically detects anomalous conditions and alert subscribers about unusual activity in their property. We introduced an enterprise grade business intelligent solution to help our service providers optimize their businesses and drive greater customer engagement and retention. And we established ObjectVideo Labs following our acquisition of ObjectVideo. This new team leads our research and development efforts in video analytics and computer vision technology. And lastly, it is worth recalling that around this time last year, we were just about to close the acquisition of the Connect and Piper business units. Today, we have successfully integrated those businesses into our operations. The goals of the acquisition were to scale up our research and development operations, while also increasing our distribution capacity. ADT is the largest customer of Connect, and we are pleased to have been able to expand our partnership with AET as a result of this acquisition. As two of the largest players in the Internet of Things and smartphone market, we are working together effectively on a number of opportunities that will allow us to create more value for the end customer while growing our businesses. To summarize our year, we have masked our long term vision for the business along multiple strategic fronts. We now manage more than $80 million connected devices and sensors and provide service to more than 5.5 million properties around the world. Next, I'd like to spend some time discussing new technologies that we recently introduced in the last few months, as well as some emerging technology trends in the smart home space. I'll begin with a few of our recent product announcements. At CES this January, we unveiled a mix of new hardware and software solutions for energy management. The new software capability is a solution we call HVAC Safeguards. It monitors the HVAC system and alerts service providers and home owners to trouble conditions before they escalate into more expensive, damage or complete system failures. Typically, consumers take a run until fail approach to maintaining their HVAC system. This increases the overall cost of ownership and failures tend to happen during time for the year when heating and cooling is needed most. By feeding our Insights Engine with data from the HVAC system, the local home environment and the local weather conditions, alarm.com can monitor performance over time and detect anomalous conditions that signal a problem. On the hardware side, we announced the new premium version of the Alarm.com Smart Thermostat. As I have indicated in the past, we selectively design and engineer devices where we believe we can strategically address gaps in the hardware ecosystem and provide differentiated value to both our service provider partners and their customers. We developed the new smart thermostat specifically to automate the installation process beyond any device on the market today. Our new thermostat will automatically detect HVAC wiring and dynamically configure the device to the specific systems that the technician is integrating. By reducing installation time and errors, we can lower the overall support burden on our service providers and enhance the customer experience. As we invest in energy management technology, we are well positioned to generate growth through multiple market opportunities. In our core residential business, our service provider partners can bring a highly differentiated product to a growing market. In the commercial space, energy savings is a key value proposition of our integrated solutions. And as consumers increasingly adopt smart thermostat, our subsidiary EnergyHub can orchestrate more devices so that their utility customers can move effectively manage peak demand periods. EnergyHub is already benefiting from consumers increasingly adopting Smart Thermostat. In 2017, customer enrollment and demand response programs managed by EnergyHub exceeded our targets. This contributed to our over performance in SaaS and license revenue in the fourth quarter. EnergyHub has also expanded its enterprise software solution and can now manage a broader range of connected devices and distributed energy resources. This led to a recent partnership with Rheem, a leading manufacturer of heating, cooling and water heating equipment. Integrating Rheem's intelligent water heaters will allow EnergyHub to deliver a richer set of grid services to their utility customers. As EnergyHub continues to expand its platform solution, they can provide more value to their customers, and tap into the growing adoption of a broad range of Internet of Things devices such as electrical vehicle charging infrastructure, energy storage systems and smart inverters. I also want to discuss the emerging trend of audio devices and voice assistance in the smart home space. Two years ago, we launched our integration of Amazon-Alexa. This past year, we added Google Home, Legrand and Sonos. Our strategy for integrating our services with audio interfaces is driven by our belief that consumers want to pick and choose their device based on their own needs and preferences. We therefore need to remain open in this domain. This is similar to the successful approach we have taken with developing apps for mobile platforms. Consumers have an array of voice assistance available, Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, Cortana and Bixby. Our goal is to deliver a uniform, seamless and secure experience across whatever interface the consumer may choose. Where voice and mobile interfaces defer is in our how our subscribers use them. Lighting control remains the most frequently used voice command with our service. It's interesting. The majority of these voice commands turn off the lights. Most of these commands happen late in the evening, likely right before bed. For most smart home interactions, subscribers who have integrated voice assistance, still use mobile predominantly. For example, when we analyze the representative cohort of users to see which interface they use on arm their security system, we found that they use mobile app 94% of the time and voice assistance only 6% of the time. This makes sense because our users often interact with their property when they are away. So while we see convenient use cases for voices assistance and we will continue to create more of these interactions, we believe that mobile will remain the dominant interface. Our users place significant importance on the ability to monitor and control their property from wherever they are. As we look to 2018, I wanted to start by commenting on the recently passed tax reform act. Alarm.com has been taxed at 35% in the past and the new tax law will in my view only help us compete. We anticipate allowing some of the savings generated by the tax act to flow to the balance sheet, while also using some of the savings to invest more aggressively in the future of our business. By increasing our investments, particularly in R&D and marketing, we can take better advantage of the breadth of opportunities that are emerging in a world where virtually every device can be and is connected to the cloud. We believe that the tax reform act is good for our business and our investors over both the near-term and long-term horizon. In 2018, we also see continued strength and growth opportunities in our core business. The security market continues to transform from traditional systems to interactive services. Our service provider partners are leading that charge. Service providers offer the support and expertise consumers want and our service provider partners remain the provider of choice. We also remained focused on expanding our opportunity for growth in the commercial space in 2018. Last year, we refined and enhanced our offerings for the small and medium size business. Many of our service providers already address the SMB market. We will further expand our offering this year and strengthen our position to capture new growth as SMB properties transition from traditional systems to smart systems. Our initiatives to develop complimentary businesses and channels also gained momentum over the last year. I mentioned EnergyHub’s recent expansion in the utility market. We are also developing a business in the HVAC channel, called Building36. In addition, PointCentral offers the property management solution for vacation rental properties, residential REITs and other businesses requiring an unattended access and delivery solution. We will continue to invest in our subsidiaries to support their growth and expand our overall market opportunity. We also continue to expand our market presence globally. Interest in our services remain high and business development activities are brisk in rest of the world. We expect to add additional European markets during the first half of this year. Growth contributions from Australia and Turkey remain strong and we were pleased to see our service provider partners in Latin America expand their use of the Alarm.com platform. We also plan to increase our marketing presence in 2018. To oversee these efforts, we recently promoted Ann Ferguson to Vice President of Marketing. Ann has led our partner marketing team since 2011. She has deep experience in the security channel and a strong reputation with our service provider partners. She has the right skills to direct our marketing program and increased awareness for both our solutions and for our service provider partners. I was happy to able to promote from within the company for this key position. Before I turn things over to Steve Valenzuela, I also want to welcome Mitchell Lee to our Board of Directors. Ms. Lee brings a deep legal background to the Alarm.com. Board, particularly in intellectual property. She has the Herman Phleger Visiting Professor of Law at Stanford Law School, where she teaches disruptive technologies and intellectual property. Before this, she was the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. And prior to her time at the USPTO, she was with Google where she served as Deputy General Counsel and as their first Head of Patent and Patent Strategy. I have enjoyed getting to know Michelle and look forward to working with her more. And with that, I'll let Steve Valenzuela update you on our financial performance. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone. I will begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and then provide guidance for 2018 before opening the call for questions. Starting with the fourth quarter, Saas and license revenue grew 39% from Q4 2016 to $65.2 million. Our fourth quarter SaaS revenue included approximately $1.2 million in energy management incentives earned by our subsidiary EnergyHub accounted for in our others segments. We record the seasonal revenue in the fourth quarter each year based on energy savings reported by utility partners. For the full year of 2017, SaaS and license revenue grew 36% from 2016 to $236.3 million. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 93.5% in the fourth quarter, consistent with our historical range of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenue in the fourth quarter increased to $23.6 million, up from $22.9 million the same quarter last year. We continue to see strong growth of our video products in the fourth quarter. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 27% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $88.8 million. Total revenue for 2017 reached $338.9 million, up 30% from 2016. Gross margin for our SaaS and license revenue was 85.5% for the fourth quarter, up about 350 basis points from the same quarter in 2016. Gross margin for hardware and other revenue was 21.9% for the fourth quarter. This is up about 150 basis points from Q4 2016 due to product mix. Total gross margin increased to 68.6% for the fourth quarter, up about 700 basis points from the same quarter last year. The higher gross margin in the fourth quarter is due to a combination of the increase in SaaS and license gross margin and a higher mix of SaaS and license revenue, accounting for 73% of total revenue for the fourth quarter compared to 67% for the same quarter last year. Turning to operating expenses. R&D expense in the fourth quarter was $18.9 million or 21% of total revenue, up from $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. We ended the fourth quarter with 447 employees in R&D, up from 320 employees at the end of 2016. Total headcount at the end of 2017 was 784 employees, up from 607 employees at December 2016. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter were $10.9 million or 12% of total revenue compared to $9.4 million or 14% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect to increase our marketing spending in 2018 to be more in line with marketing investments in prior years at approximately 14% to 15% of revenue. G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $13.6 million, down from $15.8 million in the year ago quarter. G&A expense includes non-ordinary course litigation expense of $2.3 million in the fourth quarter, slightly higher than Q4 2016 expense of $2.1 million. Non-ordinary course litigation, acquisition and integration expenses are part of our adjusted measures, and are excluded from our measurement of our non-GAAP financial performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $22.2 million for the first quarter, up 55% from $14.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For 2017, adjusted EBITDA was $71.6 million, up 46% from 2016. Before reviewing net income, let me first discuss the impact of the U.S. corporate tax reform act on our financial results. After the act was signed into law in December, we recorded a onetime tax expense of $8.8 million in the fourth quarter for the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets, resulting from the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. Largely due to this charge, GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was 320,000 compared to $3 million in the same quarter last year. Going forward, we expect an overall tax rate of 21% for 2018, down from our prior guidance of 35%. We excluded the onetime tax expense for the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from our non-GAAP net income and EPS as we do not consider this to be part of our operating performance. And as previously indicated, we also exclude some non-GAAP the favorable impact from ASU 2016-09, accounting for employee share based transactions that was effective Q1 of '17. This was a benefit of approximately $1 million to our GAAP taxes in the fourth quarter. With these items excluded from our non-GAAP financial results, non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $13 million or $0.26 per diluted share compared to $9.1 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for 2017 was $45.1 million or $0.92 per diluted share, up 45% from non-GAAP net income of $31.1 million or $0.65 per share for 2016. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $96.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. For all of 2017, we generated approximately $57.2 million in cash flow from operations, up from $22.6 million for 2016. Our free cash flow for 2017 was $46.7 million, up significantly from $13.5 million for 2016. Let me now turn to ASC 606, the new revenue accounting standard that we are required to adopt beginning in 2018. We have implemented this new accounting standard, using the modified retrospective approach effective January 2018. We have completed our assessments and we do not believe ASC 606 has a material impact on our revenue recognition policy. The adoption of this new standard required us to evaluate how we account for commissions paid to employees, which we expense as occurred in the past. Under the new standards, we are capitalizing a portion of our commission expense as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract. We also do not believe this will have a material impact on our financial results. Turning to our financial outlook for the first quarter of 2018, we expect SaaS and license revenue of $66.9 million to $67.1 million. For the full year of 2018, we expect SaaS and license revenue to be between $282.5 million to $283 million, representing growth of approximately 20% over 2017 at the midpoint of the range. We are projecting total revenue for 2018 to be $380 million to $382 million, which includes hardware and other revenue of $97.5 million to $99 million. We currently forecast that hardware revenue will be slightly lower in 2018 as the market shifts to embedding some modules and some control panels, which helps to drive lower cost for subscribers. Alarm.com does not provide control panels. We expected the shift of communication modules, which we believe will be partially offset by higher sales of cameras and thermostats. We estimate that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2018 will be between $81.5 million to $82.5 million. Non-GAAP net income for 2018 is projected to be $56 million to $57 million or $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share. And as I have indicated, we are projecting an overall tax rate of 21% for 2018 based on the new U.S. Corporate Tax Reform Act. EPS is based on an estimate of 50 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year 2018 stock based compensation expense of $9.5 million to $10 million compared to $7.4 million for 2017. We believe we are well positioned to build on our expanding market opportunity for the secure smart property in both residential and commercial sectors. And we are thankful for a strong base of service provider partners. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2017. We are focused on executing on our business strategy and investing in our growth opportunities while continuing to deliver solid financial results. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And with that operator please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.
Dan Church: In the past, you’ve talked about business intelligence tools helping dealers drive customer engagement and retention improve overall economics. Can you give us an update on the impact this is having? I understand, it is still relatively early. What are you seeing in terms of its ability to drive expand within your install base?
Steve Trundle: So we’ve invested through in business intelligence through time, we’ll continue to do so. It's getting more and more powerful all the time what we can do. The current emphasis is actually helping our service providers use the BI tools to actually reduce their ongoing cost to serve. So been able to pick up very early when there is some installation having for example that's resulting in a disproportionate number of customers having an issue later with the particular product in the ecosystem, getting that feedback back to the management team very quickly. So that they can adjust their processes get more technicians trained up on whatever that device might be. So that's the particular focus. We've also used the product, it's really not just us using it, our service providers are using it to identify what are the things. And I've talked about this a bit in the past, what are the things that I as a service provider can do to drive higher engagement from my customers. And we've identified about $50 or $60 attributes that one might choose to pursue in the way they created customer management customer but then we've boil that down to the top five or six best practices that a service provider can follow when they initiate a new relationship with the customer. And if they follow those things with some of the legend, they will get a higher engaged customer but then it trip at a lower level. So those are a couple of examples of how we’re using the business intelligence infrastructure for the benefit of the service providers. And then there is a lot of stuff going on and really inside the offering itself where we have a technology we call insights engine that I spoke a bit about just a moment ago, but I'm going to leave that for later.
Dan Church: And in terms -- so we've seen a few announcements from Amazon and other DIY vendors. Just can you speak to composition of the DIY market more broadly? Do you see that as potentially being cannibalistic longer term or the driving smart home adoption? Thanks.
Steve Trundle: No, I mean we've seen these really -- we've seen announcements since the beginning of the time in the DIY market. We've seen new entrants like Google come in, by Nest, by DropCam, Amazon by Blink. I think we just saw our announcements before I jumped on this call from Amazon. So I think the reality is that our customer prefers a do it for me solution. They want a relationship with a service provider that's going to maintain whatever apparatus is installed in their home. They want to make sure that the smoke detector that's installed upstairs in their child’s bedroom is installed the right way and is always going to work. And if it's not operational, someone is going to be able to come out there and get is fixed. So we see a lot of these products emerge and generate some interest, generate some cost. We think they primarily appeal to a constituency that’s not our core customer folks that are in a rental property or in a smaller property maybe having need for a point solution. I think our hope is that in many ways what the DIY products are doing is cultivating an interest and the type of solution that we can provide to them, hopefully for the -- at some later point in time. So if I become condition to believe that it is possible for me to remotely monitor my property with a given camera solution. And now I move into a larger home and I want to have a lot of different subsystems all work together, we think that's where our service provider comes in. And we're hoping that a broader group of consumers will be aware of the capability of those solutions like the one we offer. So I don’t think we've seen any real dramatic factory sort of predatory impact from the DIY. I'm sure they are getting their fair share of customers but haven't seen they dramatically affect our service providers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse.
Chris Rochester: We heard from somebody in our network that ADT have the ability to upgrade Pulse customers under the Alarm platform over the air without a truck roll. Is that true? And if not, could you maybe talk about the progress in getting ADT to move over to the Alarm platform?
Steve Trundle: So on the first question, I stay in close touch with my friends at ADT and I don't remember ever hearing that that's something they have actually been able to do. It's not likely that they would upgrade an existing Pulse customer. There may be some outlier I am not considering. But for the most part, I can't think of a scenario where they would upgrade or have upgraded any existing Pulse customer over the year to Alarm.com without some type of services. And so I doubt that and I think that's probably just probably not the case. With regards to the overall relationship I referenced it a bit in my prepared comments. Relationships very healthy, we’re working on a lot of things that I think will let ADT lead with as the year unfolds. And really I think more fully integrated VI control team at this point. They are very solid. The offering has been -- the existing Pulse offering I think has been well handled. It is more robust than it's ever been. And the two groups are working together really on a longer term set of initiatives now that we think will be good for both businesses.
Chris Rochester: And then maybe a quick follow up for Steve, if I may. Looking at the adjusted EBITDA guidance and the implied margin expansion is lower than we’ve seen over the past couple of years. I mean would we have seen a similar step up in operating expenses if it weren’t for the benefit in the tax code?
Steve Trundle: So I think we’re showing about 40 basis point increase in 2018 guidance. If you look at 2017, we came it at 21.2%, which is -- 21.1%. So with the guidance we’re providing for '18, we are taking that up a bit. But as Steve said on his call, we’re really taking the opportunity to invest further in marketing and also in R&D. And so you’ll see that the obviously the non-GAAP net income is of course going up substantially over the consensus. So we’re letting some of that flow through the balance sheet. But in terms of EBTIDA where we invest in marketing where in the past if you look at 2017, we said only 12% on marketing and sales and marketing, which was historically very low. So we’re taking that up to 14% to 15% and we’re taking -- continue to make some investments in R&D. So we think that's right given all the opportunities in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.
John DiFucci: A quick question for Steve Trundle and for Steve Valenzuela. Steve, just a question on the commercial and thanks for all the detail you went through and the opportunities going forward this year. Back at the Analyst Day, you had talked about introducing new product called an access control product, tailored to the commercial SMB market. Can you assure any progress on bringing this product to market and how you think could unfold going forward?
Steve Trundle: We’re anxious to get that product fully generally available and announced properly. But as you saw at the Analyst Day, we've made a lot of progress. The product is in, what I would call, full robust late data stage now where I believe over 100 of service providers are actually installing the product. We’re making sure you get all the details right. The reception has been very good. So we've been -- I've been particularly pleased I guess I would say with the part of the feedback that we're getting from the service providers and where their commentary on the quality of the product. So that's all good. And I think you will see us in the middle part of the year, if not a little before, announce that product formally and bring it to market.
John DiFucci: And I guess as to Steve Venezuela, that question that Steve Trundle talked about the benefits and what you might do with the extra cash from the lower tax rate. And I'm just curious if you could quantify that and some anyway when we look at across our coverage universe just given that your front at least today primarily in the U.S. and you are comfortably profitable and have been for very long time. We see you as one of the few in our coverage anyway that's see meaningful impact here?
Steve Venezuela: If we look at in profitability that the company has delivered has been quite good again with 21.1% EBITDA in 2017. But what's interesting to look at again is the way that EBITDA, we’re increasing the EBITDA growth over 2017 of 40 basis points. Again, it's because of the investments we’re making really are more in the marketing area, given that we’re coming off as a really low, if you will, year in marketing investments and then in R&D we’re continuing to make investments in R&D. If you look at in 2017, which is the acquisition of Connect and ObjectVideo and those really help to set us up in terms of significant opportunities with regard to a video analytics with connect working with ADT. And so it's interesting to see the way the tax works out. EBITDA is obviously before tax. And so we're making those investments. As Steve said on his prepared remarks, we're letting some of that flow to the balance sheet and also the P&L as we're taking that income up quite a bit compared to what we’ve seen in the past. So we're balancing both and we think the right thing to do is to make those investments. Given that we're really participating in a very large market opportunity with the smart home and the Internet of Things.
John DiFucci: We come up though like we have double-digit growth in free cash flow just from the tax alone. But I guess we’ll see how it plays out. Thanks a lot guys. Nice job.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Nikolay Beliov: Just wanted to get an update on the international front from you guys, exiting 2016 you were running 34,000 subscribers additions per month. What is that number currently and generally speaking in light of the opportunity in the domestic market, how much of your priorities internationally at this point?
Steve Trundle: How much of a priority is the international market going forward. So yes, I think if you roll back to '16 I stated we had a goal of getting the 4,000 a month basically quadrupling production inside the year that year we were -- and then I think at the end of the year, I updated that we were just shy of that number. We kept pushing in '17 and where I can say comfortably well north of that goal now. So the team is doing very well. And I think we’ve also turned the corner on some of the things that created latency in our ability to really expand globally. And most of those were product related. We have the right set of ecosystem components, different certifications for each market, we need to get different carriers set up. And sometimes it felt like you’re taking two steps forward and one back all of the time in various markets. But at this point as we indicated, we feel very good about couple of the early markets, which were Australia and Turkey. We’re adding some European markets in the first half of this year. Our partnership with Securitas remained strong. So it's taken a little longer for us to get everything up to speed and get them rolling out, but that's going well. Lat-Am is doing well. So at the moment I guess I would say we’re enthusiastic about the year ahead and rest of world. We feel like this will almost certainly be our best year ever there. And in terms of relative priority, because the pipeline looks good to us and because things are beginning to really move towards being even more of the contribution, I think we think that it's pretty darn high priority for us. So it's a high priority for our technology team, getting the right control panels in place is always a high priority. So I would say on a relative basis it's in probably the top three.
Nikolay Beliov: And a question for the other Steve. Can you give us a sense, if you can, the breakdown of the 5.5 million subscribers between Alarm.com and maybe Steve if you could help us with the model?
Steve Venezuela: In terms of the 5.5 million subscribers, again most of those are residential. And I didn't hear the back part of your question. We have been increasing and seeing good growth rates at commercial, but it's also the lower base. We talked about at the Analyst Day that we were going to be introducing more features for the commercial market, including access control. The pilot on that is going very well. So we think that there will be good opportunity in commercial, but it’s still I would say relatively early and is still small part of the 5.5 million subscribers, and most of those by the way as well. Again, I didn't hear the last part of the question. But if you are asking about the breakup between international and between domestic, most of those are also domestic North America.
Nikolay Beliov: Actually my question was if you split that up between ADT, Pulse subscribers and Alarm.com subscribers?
Steve Venezuela: So the last time ADT updated that number, I believe it was about a year ago. And I had said, I believe they said their subscriber base is over 2 million and we don’t feel that we should really be talking about ADTs numbers unless they publicly have produced that. So obviously, they've grown over the last year and certainly part of the 5.5 million subscriber base of Alarm.com is connect and good portion of that is ADT.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair.
Matt Pfau: I wanted to dig a bit more into the sales and marketing investments. And so I guess, number one why was I guess less spent on in terms of percentage of revenue on sales and marketing in 2017 relative to prior years. And then as you think about the investments in 2018, what are the main areas of where those incremental dollars are going. Because I guess theoretically now that you have relationships with many of the more significant dealers, especially in North America that you can have relationships with, they would seen that there was potentially be a decent amount of leverage in the sales and marketing line item?
Steve Trundle: So looking at '17, the question is why we take it down. The reason is that at the beginning of the year, we were trying to complete a material acquisition. There is a lot of expense around that. We work positive or 100% of exactly what all of the integration expenses would be. And I think we felt like we needed to let the dust settle a little bit on that and see what steady state condition of the business would be afterwards in terms of cash flow production before we open this ticket fully on marketing. At the same time, we took advantage of that opportunity to test. You are constantly running various marketing programs and sometimes you need the base line how they are doing by testing what happens if you do nothing. So how much Web site traffic are you getting if you’re not running that digital campaign and then when you lay your digital campaign on, you can usually see what incremental contribution it make. So we were doing some of that in the back half of the year as well. We made a big move with adding our VP of Marketing towards the end of the year. And at this point, we feel like we have pretty good visibility on the way the engines working in terms of cash production. And we’re therefore comfortable beginning layer back on some sales and marketing spend, especially on the marketing side, I would say. In terms of how we deploy, we’re not going to get into some brand lower with in the market. I think we're going to look selectively as we tend to do as the audiences that we want to reach. We feel like we have pretty good data on what type of person becomes an Alarm.com customer. So you'll see us be more targeted probably more digital than big brand type of advertising. And then we do a lot with our service providers with the program, we call NDF where we work with the service providers to help them with their local direct response marketing initiatives. And I think we’ll continue to do some of that probably at a higher scale in 2018.
Steve Venezuela: And I think it’s important to put in perspective again the numbers -- again the guidance rate is taking up the adjusted EBITDA quite nicely up over 2017 by over $14 million -- $11 million in terms of the guidance and increasing the adjusted EBITDA percentage as well by 40 basis points. So that's -- I think there is many SaaS companies out there that would love to be have that level of profitability of 21.5% adjusted EBITDA and $82 million of adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of the guidance. So I think those are very good numbers.
Matt Pfau: And then the other thing I wanted to ask about is in terms of the guidance and your expectations for the commercial business in 2018. I guess how -- is there a decent amount of success built into the guidance in terms of with the commercial business or should we think of commercial as more of potential upside to the guidance that you've provided?
Steve Trundle: So as consistent with the prior practice, we're doing a certain amount in commercial today and there we with an interactive smart commercial solution but we don't have the full product in that we want to have in the market. And as I answered the question earlier from John, I think I talked about a midyear entry point for the access product. So our practice is we don’t attempt to assign upside the things that are not yet really in the market. And we build our estimates and our model off of things that currently have traction that we feel we can have a reasonable chance of projecting. So that's how we look at it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Gearhart with First Analysis.
David Gearhart: My first question I wanted to ask about litigation expenses. Litigation expenses were down over $5 million in '17 versus '17. And I think some of that had to do with IP and exhibits and patents in review. Just wondering if we should expect a pick-up in litigation expenses in '18 if you could provide an update there?
Steve Trundle: So '17 there is some lows in the activity at various points and measures off the litigation expenses lower. I think what I would do, we can't comment specifically on what we’re going to spend on there. We don’t actually even know often times. But I think that I would look to '16 as an indicator as a better base line for what you probably should be modeling for '18.
David Gearhart: And then going back to guidance, previously you provided a preliminary outlook for '18, 375 to 385 and top line, 380 at the midpoint, new guidance is 381 at the midpoint so 1 million uptick there, would have expected a little bit more just given the strong Q4 and you are investing more in the sales and marketing, primarily the marketing side but would have expected a little bit more of a pickup. Can you talk a little bit about why we’re not getting as much of a pickup? Is it more related to the hardware issue that you talked about or the substitution of embedded modules for that part of the business and maybe quantify that impact to better gauge where revenue could have been? That's my question.
Steve Trundle: Well first, we did move it up a little bit. I think the -- it's early in the year. I think we also now put out a number, gave you some guardrails around the hardware number. So I think you probably interpret from what we put out an improved revenue mix now with the updated guidance that is important to us in terms of the mix of SaaS and license versus hardware. On the hardware side, we’ve never gotten overly concerned with hardware revenue. And what we’re seeing is more of our service providers adopting control panels where we’ve licensed the technology for the radio and it's embedded on the main board of the control panel. So that in terms of new installations those are using our radio versus that radio that we’ve manufactured versus using one that a third party manufacturer. As we look to '18, we see that number moving from 41%, 42% in '17 using radios that we made to a 33% type of level for '18. So you see some -- and that's not a great -- there's no spread. So that’s not really an upsetting dynamic, but it's a trend that has unfolded I think particularly in the last couple of months we’ve seen a couple of guys shift their purchase habits so little bit there. And then beyond that I think I would just say it's early in the year.
David Gearhart: And then lastly from me, you provided some commentary in prior quarters on HVAC channel. I think you had mentioned previously you had 20 partners, it's early days obviously. Just wondering if you could provide an update in terms of number of partners there and what you are seeing in terms of sales activity and also cross selling with HVAC and maybe even selling security and other offerings?
Steve Trundle: So that effort -- don’t have the exact number of new signs there in front of me. But my guess is we’re probably up to 40 maybe even 50 at this point. That team has then super productive for us and was really the team that produced the thermostat that we just announced at CES. So we continue to see uptick of the Alarm.com thermostat across the business, not just in Building36 but also in Alarm.com and elsewhere, which is a positive. With the HVAC channel, it’s still a channel that we are enthusiastic about. I would say wer’e still very, very days. So of the things in our other segment that we talk about, I think more mature are PointCentral and EnergyHub, both at a predictable pace at this point with Building36 and the HVAC channel some of it’s still trying to get them the exact right product, so working with that first set of partners, but earlier in their formation and a little less predictable still at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.
Jeff Kessler: And in the past you've been rightly proud of the imager that you've had out there if you want to call it the motion detector video imager that you put in as a means of reducing of supplemented verification, increasing the customer experience at a recent long conference that we were at, couple of your customers were talking about a new line coming out in the next several months. And I'm wondering if you could -- well not, you probably not going to go into the details of the enhancement. Is this the type of thing that will further improved the ability to effectively justify the use of law and professional warrant companies as verification providers in the end or does this enhanced verification capability?
Steve Trundle: So we refer to that product as the image sensor. It's something we pioneer the goal at the time of initially crafting the product was can we find a way to deliver a consumer a sensor that also takes pictures very, very inexpensively and in a way that the pictures can actually been translated via a fairly low bandwidth cellular connection up to the central station. So that was the goal. We met that goal with the first in connection with products. There is a new -- and if you stop and think about it, PIRs has been around forever and you actually saw why would I even want an infrared motion detector that doesn’t take pictures. If someone is in my home or business, I would like to see who it is. And it’s incremental cost for that is fairly modest than that's possible. The product continues to work in a cell only format, which is unique if you compare that there are lots of ways to get imageries and content out of a property base, primarily with the broadband connection and video cameras. But image sensors are still well positioned for all of those properties where either the consumer doesn't want us to cater to the broadband connection or the service provider doesn't want to mess with it. So still a good product. We see it on -- installed on a healthy number of accounts. The new version is going to extend the battery life further, improve the image quality, give us an ability to increase to maybe even take short form videos with the lens. So lots of different things we’re doing there. And I think what you’re referring to is then back the integration that we get with the simplification is an area where it's impossible for sometimes. We just keep shifting away at the 1,000 different central stations that we’re actually connected to and get them up to a point that they can actually handle the content that we’re able to provide when there's an alarm condition in the property. So it's a constant effort that we’re engaged in. And if we get all the central up to a common base line of capabilities then I think that definitely helps with the positioning of our professional service providers.
Jeff Kessler: A couple of things that you got involved in toward the beginning of the year that you mentioned, but you didn't really go into very much, stuff like the group of folks that you’ve got from ObjectVideo. They are obviously working on analytics and things like that. Could you delve a little bit more into not necessarily the primary stuff you probably won't talk about. But what is the goal of this team toward -- what end are they going to be used for again differentiating this company from its competition?
Steve Trundle: So the first goal is to provide an outstanding consumer experience around our video offering. And to do that, I think we need to cut down on the noises consumers getting the amount of -- I actually even tested other products. And the number of clips you get relative to the amount of valuable content you get that ratio should be fairly low right now, it's generally very high. You get lots of clips and lots of noise for the one thing that you actually want to see. So with our video analytics team, we’re attempting to discern what those things are that the consumers are interested in. We’re doing a lot of object classification work and a lot of trip wire work to make sure that when we deliver a clip and we’re even a period reporting to the consumer, we can point to them, point out the events that should be relevant, it’s important. If we do that, then the overall -- especially if they can do that with low cost cameras. So the other big challenge here some of this capability has been available traditionally in a very high cost format where we’re either running massive server infrastructure or you’re running a fairly expensive camera that is $300, $400 camera. So we’re trying to make this possible with cameras that are going to fit a price point that our service providers tell us they can take into the residential markets successfully and that's really the goal there.
Jeff Kessler: Most of my other questions were answered. However, if you could just go into a little bit of any developments internationally, I know you have again you’ve talked about it generally. But what are the things that you need to do to in addition to making EnergyHub a contributor? You’re focusing on geographic areas. Can you bring some of the new projects you’re working on to the international arena yet or is it still in the stage of just making sure that the cut that the service groups out there be they in Australia or in Sweden are just simply comfortable with you. And at what point are you with these guys?
Steve Trundle: So we're definitely more at the early point where there is one-to-one play that we’ll have at some point where when we really feel good about with our service provider partner in a country like Australia we’ll bring in other products that we already perhaps didn’t find it here in North America. But for now there is so much interest in just smart home for doing that well that’s what the consumer want, doing that with the equipment that they have. But that's very much still our focus with these early relationships and we're not getting distracted by bringing in EnergyHub or brining in the PointCentral offering. We've got enough up take with those here in North America at the moment. But if you roll the clock forward by six years and we get to the point that in rest of the world where similarly positioned as we are here today in North America, then at that point it makes sense to take the businesses that we've crafted in the other segment and roll those rest of world as well. But at the moment, we’re really more in beachhead mode where we're getting set up, getting people productive, getting them trained, getting supply chain straightened out and trying to drive numbers on smart home.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi with Roth Capital Partners.
Darren Aftahi: Just if any follow-up on the marketing spend. Can you handicap the incremental and the absolute where you plan to spend that? And I guess what I'm getting at is some of your smaller or relative install bases, i. e. commercial or international like what are your plans to step up spending in those segments. And then if you do plan to spend more aggressively on marketing and international, any geographies you call out? Thanks.
Steve Trundle: The step up is a step up, but it's not a dramatic step up from where we were. Of course ‘16 these we’re talking a few million dollars I think in discretionary spend increase. And the focus there is first some additional brand work in a very targeted way against some audience that we think would have a high proclivity to take services like those offered by Alarm.com. So we’ll be surgical there that will be brand work where we’re trying to drive interest in the technology so that we can then refer those who are interested back to our service providers or so that they've already heard about Alarm.com when the service provider shows up on the door step. Second is to do some additional local marketing with our service providers, which is a little bit more of a direct response where we’re helping them to get a program stood up. It might be that we actually we generate the content they use I mean the TV ads or the radio spots then they go deploy that with their own phone numbers and their own brand, some work there. And then third is we’re going to do a little bit more in industry marketing this year than we've done. We've got some new offerings that we've alluded to on the video side on the commercial side and on the access side. With each of those, we have a duty to get the word out so you'll see us spend a bit more on industry marketing back out to our service providers and to new service providers. So that folks are aware of what we have in the product arsenal and those will be really the three places we focus, not so much international. International remains an opportunity but probably won't be a heavy focus other than getting all of our collateral and our basic marketing infrastructure in place. I don't think we’ll go out and try to -- as an example dominate any given Latin American country with consumer market. And I think we’ll be helping our service providers in those markets get the right infrastructure in place so they can do their own marketing.
Darren Aftahi: And then just as a follow-up, I mean as we think about the cadence, you’ve shown pretty nice operating leverage historically and you’ve investing in '18. There we look a little bit more intermediate term. Is that the cadence which we should expect from you guys or is this continued operating leverage is more of a one-time step up and truing up your marketing spend?
Steve Trundle: I think we’ll assess each year as the year unfolds and see how we field out the market. But generally -- directionally I think what we’ve done this year or what we’re projecting this year is probably congruent with what we have at this moment and anticipate to be cadence where there's slightly more operating leverage being let out of the business, but at the same time not -- that's coming from higher revenues and improved revenue mix. And we’re still pretty focused on taking advantage and being well positioned for the opportunity that we see unfolding over the next decade. So we definitely don't think we’re at the point yet where we want to fully pull the operating leverage lever in the business, we’re looking longer term.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital.
Mike Latimore: On the commercial side of things, over the long term, is there any inherent difference in mix, hardware service versus what you’re seeing on the residential side?
Steve Trundle: Difference in mix in terms of -- commercial does have some more hardware components to it. It also had a good SaaS component. I think we’ve talked about in the past that commercial actually has a higher ARPU because there tends to be more video, it tends to be a little bit different configuration. So you tend to see ARPU on average twice as high as residential, and sometimes three times as high. So there will be more hardware. I think as we -- as Steve talked about earlier in this call, when we talked about the guidance for the year again we’re talking about what we know today. And so we’re looking at the year and figuring out exactly the timing of when commercial will be ramping up. And so typically with hardware as you’ve seen in the past, we’re fairly cautious about the numbers we give out for that in advance in terms of the guidance. But certainly there is a good hardware component related to commercial.
Mike Latimore: And then just last on the quarter just reported. After video, what was the second and third additional device or sensor that was in demand in the quarter?
Steve Trundle: So, first is for what we call professional video, second after that is locked, door lock and I believe third would be probably thermostat followed closely by image sensor and then you get down into like garage door and so many other things.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
52;ALRM;2018-05-05;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alarm.com Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. David Trone, Vice President of Investor Relations.
David Trone: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alarm.com’s First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Joining us today from Alarm.com are Steve Trundle, President and CEO; and Steve Valenzuela, CFO. Before we begin, a quick reminder to our listeners. Management’s discussion during the call today will include forward-looking statements, which may include projected financial results or operating metrics, business strategies, anticipated future products and services, anticipated investment and expansion, anticipated market demand or opportunities and other forward-looking statements.

The webcast of this call will be archived, and a telephone replay will also be available on our website. With these formalities out of the way, I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve Trundle. You may begin.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, David, and welcome to everyone joining our call today. We are pleased to report a strong start to 2018 as our first quarter results exceeded our expectations. Our SaaS and license revenue in the first quarter was $68 million, up from $50 million in Q1 of 2017. Our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $23 million, up 63% over last year. In the first quarter, our team continued to execute on initiatives to extend our position as the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. Starting with our commercial platform, we announced Alarm.com for Business. This new integrated solution is unique in the market and will help our service providers expand their opportunities in the small and medium-sized business marketplace. We released Alarm.com for Business to our service providers for general availability in early April. As part of the offering, we designed and implemented a comprehensive training and certification program for our partners, which they must complete in order to distribute and install the offering. We expect that this new platform will give our service providers an opportunity to grow their addressable market by attacking the small and medium-sized business space. Key capabilities of Alarm.com for Business include proactive commercial-grade security, video surveillance, sophisticated user management, multi-location awareness and intelligent operational reporting all delivered via a single integrated platform. In parallel and as part of our Alarm.com for Business solution, we also introduced a series of enhanced video cameras. These include the commercial-grade 726 mini bullet and 826 dome video cameras as well as the 736 outdoor bullet and 836 turret cameras. Lastly, we added a major new offering with the release of our new Smarter Access Control solution. Smarter Access Control is a complete access control solution designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses. We developed this solution based on lots of feedback from our service providers. It is innovative in the way that it fully integrates with the Alarm.com cloud-based platform and works with our entire spectrum of services including video surveillance, monitored security and energy management and automation services. The solution is also innovative in the way we designed the user management software. From a simple mobile interface, subscribers can intuitively establish permissions for all access points of a business and for multiple employees. Permissions span both access control and intrusion detections systems, and employees can be granted access to a facility with traditional access cards or directly with the Alarm.com mobile app. Facility managers and security personnel can review the video associated with access events, receive door-specific alerts and create scheduled lock and unlock rules. During the first quarter, we conducted a beta program that included over 150 businesses. We then publicly unveiled our Alarm.com for Business platform in April at the International Security Conference and Exposition known as ISC West. The reaction that we’ve seen thus far is encouraging. We believe that by integrating access control with video, intrusion and energy management, we and our service providers can provide a unique range of highly valued capabilities at a very competitive price point. At ISC West, we also showcased our new line-up of devices for the residential ecosystem. This included new locks, appliance switches, audio system integrations with Sonos and Legrand, our next-gen smart thermostat, a new streamed video recorder for 24x7 video recording and a 180-degree field of view indoor Wi-Fi camera with push-to-talk capability. And of equal importance, we demonstrated a wide variety of partner growth and productivity services and executed training programs on these services onsite, all with a focus on strengthening our value proposition to our partners. As in prior years, the highlight of the show, for me, was hearing how our service provides appreciate our strong support operation. Providing great partner support through both innovative technology and hands-on service is a key component of our strategy. We believe that we remain best-in-class in this area. This belief was further validated when ICMI, a leading call center consulting firm, named our partner service center as a finalist in the category of Best Strategic Value to the Organization. We know how important it is to support our service provides when they need help, and we place a high level of emphasis on customer service. It is our belief that our commitment to this part of our business helps our service providers sell more, helps them provide a better experience for the end customer and makes it more likely that they will remain our partner and continue to feature our products and services through time. I want to turn next to what we are seeing in the market. We continue to see our service providers performing well. Through the first four months of this year, our service providers have collectively originated more new accounts than in the first four months of any prior year. This excludes contributions from Connect, which Alarm.com did not own in prior years. The most successful service providers are those who focus on building a well-branded, service-oriented relationship with the customer. They emphasize their ability to make it easy for a potential customer to purchase an integrated smart home system that has best-in-class dependable security at its core. I am frequently asked about the impact of new entrants on our market. It was 2014 when Google purchased Nest, Apple launched HomeKit and Samsung purchased SmartThings, so we have been watching the retail space carefully for over four years. Over these years, we have seen many DIY products from both startups and large technology companies. Such products are typically positioned as cheaper alternatives to the products and services that our service providers offer. There are customers for these offerings as the market is very diverse, but the customer for retail products is not often our customer. Our customers want a security system with smart home capabilities that is well-designed, cleanly installed, certain to work when needed and, perhaps most importantly, doesn’t create a new burden on their time. Our customer views their smart home system as a permanent investment in their home or business. They value the fact that a local servicing company will stand behind the installation. They value the fact that the system will serve its purpose regardless of whether their broadband connection is up, their power is on or whether they are available to receive an emergency text message. Our customer also wants to be sure that the data from their home is used solely for the purposes of keeping them safe and in control. So if a potential customer wants to have a professional security system and wants to enjoy the best of today’s smart home capabilities, then our service providers offer the best available option in the market. And this is why we believe we are seeing continued growth along with our service provider partners. We don’t dispute that there is also a market for cheaper, typically retail DIY-oriented security alternatives as we ourselves dabbled in that market after acquiring the Piper product business. This market is very competitive and the customer tends to be less interested in a comprehensive security system or a relationship with a service provider. They also tend to be more price-sensitive and interested in solving a specific narrow monitoring or automation need. Because the lifetime value of these customer relationships is much lower, if positive at all, the retail market is generally not appealing for our service provider partners. Next, I want to provide more specifics about our planned marketing investments, as discussed last quarter. We are investing more heavily in marketing programs this year to support the new release of Alarm.com for Business and to continue to differentiate our technology and our service provider partners with consumers in our target segments. We will also continue to help our service providers with co-advertising campaigns. Most of these initiatives will get rolling in the second quarter and will continue through the rest of 2018. We do not view our 2018 marketing investments as a major new initiative, but rather as a resumption of a steady marketing effort and well-established programs. In conclusion, we are off to a solid start to 2018 and we’re looking forward to the year ahead. Along with our service provider partners, we have a broad set of opportunities to execute against in both the residential and commercial markets. Before turning the call over to Steve Valenzuela, I also want to welcome David Trone, who recently joined us to head up Investor Relations. Welcome, David. And with that, I’ll let Steve update you on our financial results. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to welcome David to the team. David brings a wealth of experience to Alarm.com. He spent almost two decades as a sell-side research analyst and most recently transitioned to investor relations. Next, I will review our first quarter 2018 financial results and then provide guidance for the second quarter and our raised outlook for the full year of 2018 before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the first quarter grew 35% from the same quarter last year to $68 million. This includes Connect revenue of approximately $9.9 million for the first quarter compared to $2.3 million for the partial quarter of Q1 2017, from the closing of the acquisition on March 8, 2017. I’d like to remind everyone that our Connect software offering has a slightly different deployment model than our Alarm.com platform. Both solutions generate monthly fees charged to service providers sold on a per-subscriber basis. For Connect, the service provider typically deploys the software in their own network operations center using their personnel and equipment to operate the software. The service provider also needs to purchase their own server capacity, network operations bandwidth and cellular services among other expenses they must incur. With Alarm.com, all the services I just mentioned are managed and hosted in our data centers and provided on a turnkey basis for our service providers. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 93% in the first quarter, consistent with our historical revenue renewal rate of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenue in the first quarter was $24.8 million compared to $24 million for Q1 2017. Total revenue for the first reached $92.8 million, up 25% from $74.2 million for the same quarter last year. SaaS and license gross margin for the first quarter was 84%, consistent with our gross margin in the same quarter last year. Hardware gross margin was 29% for the first quarter compared to 23% for the same quarter last year. The higher hardware gross margin in the quarter was mainly due to mix as we were supply-constrained in the first quarter on a few products that carry lower gross margins. We expect hardware margins to moderate in the future consistent with our historical range of 20% to 22%. Total gross margin increased to 69% for the first quarter, up from 64% in Q1 2017. The higher gross margin in the first quarter is mainly due to a richer mix of SaaS and license revenue accounting for 73% of total revenue for the first quarter compared to 68% for the same quarter last year. Turning to operating expense, R&D expenses in the first quarter were $20.4 million compared to $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, as we continue to invest in R&D given the significant opportunities we see in our markets. We ended with 460 employees in R&D and total headcount of 809 employees. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter were $10.8 million, or 12% of total revenue, compared to $10.3 million, or 14% of revenue, in the same quarter last year. We expect to increase our investment in sales and marketing throughout the remainder of the year as we roll out marketing programs to promote our new and expanded offerings including Alarm.com for Business and Smarter Access Control. Also, as Steve mentioned, our major trade show of the year, ISC West, was held in Q2 and most of those expenses flow to sales and marketing in Q2. As we communicated on last quarter’s earnings call, we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year to be approximately 14% to 15% of total revenue. G&A expenses in the first quarter were $16.2 million compared to $15.4 million in the year-ago quarter. G&A expense includes non-ordinary-course litigation expense of $3.3 million in the first quarter compared to $1.8 million in Q1 2017. Non-ordinary-course litigation expenses are part of our adjusted measures and are excluded from our measurement of our non-GAAP financial performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $23 million in the first quarter, up 63% from $14.1 million in same quarter last year. In the first quarter, GAAP net income increased to $10.5 million compared to $4 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was $16.7 million in the first quarter compared to $7.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $96.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $3.5 million in cash flow from operations. We pay our annual employee bonuses in the first quarter, which totaled approximately $6 billion. Other uses of cash in the quarter included $3.5 million for the payout to the founding employees of PointCentral per their initial agreements and prepayments of inventory of approximately $5.6 million. We have now fully adopted ASC 606, the new revenue accounting standard, and, as previously indicated, this has not had a material impact on our financial results. We have added additional disclosures in our 10-Q as required per ASC 606. Moving to our financial outlook, we expect Q2 SaaS and license revenue of $69.4 million to $69.6 million, and we are increasing our expectations for full year 2018 SaaS and license revenue to be between $284 million to $284.5 million. This compares to our prior outlook for SaaS and license revenue for 2018 of $282.5 million to $283 million. We are also raising our guidance for total revenue for 2018 to $381.5 million to $383.5 million, up from our prior guidance of $380 million to $382 million. This includes our guidance for hardware and other revenue of $97.5 million to $99 million, which is unchanged from our prior guidance. Recall that we indicated on the last quarter’s call that we expect a market shift to embedding some of our modules in some control panels in 2018, which helps to drive costs down for subscribers. We expect this shift to have more of an impact on our hardware revenue beginning in the second quarter. We are increasing our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2018 to be between $82.5 to $83.2 million, up from our prior range of $81.5 million to $82.5 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA be lower than Q1 in each of the remaining three quarters of this year as we invest in marketing and R&D. We expect adjusted EBITDA for Q2 and Q3 to be at about the same level and Q4 to be seasonally higher than Q3 by approximately 6% to 8%. We are also raising our guidance for non-GAAP net income for 2018, which is now expected to be $57 million to $57.5 million, or a $1.14 million to $1.15 per diluted share, up from our prior guidance of $56 million to $57 million, or $1.12 to $1.14 per diluted share. This is based on our non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, as we have previously indicated, reflecting the new U.S. corporate tax rate. EPS is based on an estimate of 50 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year 2018 stock-based compensation expense of $11.5 million to $12 million. In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We are excited about the opportunities ahead for us and our partners with our recent launch of our expanded SMB solutions, Alarm.com for Business and Smarter Access Control, among other new products and services. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And with that, operator, please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Chris Rochester: Hey guys, this is Chris Rochester on for Michael. Quick question on commercial. Could you maybe remind us of the size of the commercial market that you’re planning to address? And then maybe any sort of sense on the magnitude of the difference in ARPS versus your residential offerings?
Steve Trundle: Yes. This is Steve Trundle speaking. North America size TAM, probably 4 million properties is how we would size that market. We don’t necessarily expect we’re going to get them all, but that’s how we would identify the market. I think ARPU generally on commercial to us is approximately double the average, and to our service providers can be significantly higher than what they would obtain from a residential customer. And that’s probably – those are the two questions, I think, right?
Chris Rochester: Got it. That’s helpful. And then maybe kind of sticking on ARPS side. I’m sure this year with the addition of Icontrol that probably pulled down the blended ARPs a bit. And I know you don’t give subscribers or guide to that. But as we kind of think about 2018 if more commercial is coming online, should we kind of expect that ARPS to potentially – that blended ARPS to potentially increase? Or will that continue to be offset by additions from Icontrol?
Steve Trundle: I think it will be a function of what percentage of our mix comes from commercial. If it’s a modest amount, then I would expect, at least what we would model is probably ARPS in the ballpark of where we are today. Currently, approximately 2.5% of our accounts are on a commercial service plan. So if we’re able to get the new offering in the market, get our dealers trained up and see that accelerate, it potentially can move the dial up a bit. But remember you’re moving it on a really, on a meaningful base, so it would take quite a few accounts to move that large base up too dramatically. And then you kind of offset that with routine competitive pressures and routine incentives and what not that are a part of our relationship with our service providers. And I’m not sure we would, at this point, be comfortable modeling the ARP up. I don’t necessarily think that the – with the Connect piece that’s still – it’s unclear exactly that that’s going to necessarily be pulling down the ARP, but I wouldn’t jump to model it up just yet.
Chris Rochester: And I’m sure, because you didn’t bring it up, there haven’t been any major developments with ADT. But anything worth kind of calling out there as you think about potentially transitioning onto Alarm from Icontrol?
Steve Trundle: Yes. Well, I guess with ADT, what I can say is we obviously continue to work with ADT. I think we’re excited about the things that they’re working on potentially in concert with us. And we’re excited about their roadmap. I think I would be best served to allow ADT to, when they feel it’s the right time for them, to announce exactly what their new product or what their product may be. So I’m going to hold off on that, at this point.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
John DiFucci: Thank you. I have a question for Steve Valenzuela and then a follow-up for Steve Trundle. So Steve Valenzuela, everything looks good in the quarter, good momentum in the business, but cash flow was a lot lower than we were looking for. Especially when we look at the lower U.S. tax rate, we would have expected you to benefit more than most, anybody in our coverage, a couple other players too. But it looks like the use of cash had a lot to do with working capital so I just want to make sure I understand this. It looks like the other assets line and accounts payable lines, together there’s about a use of cash of $12 million to $13 million, which we didn’t expect. I guess can you explain what we’re seeing there and what we should expect moving forward? Will those things like get us the other direction next quarter? Or if you can explain it.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, John, hi, this is sorry to cut you off there. This is Steve Valenzuela. Yes, in terms of the cash for the quarter, we did point out that there was a $3.5 million payment to the earning employees of PointCentral. That, of course, would not be reoccurring. There was also a $5.6 million prepayment for inventory of cash going out in Q1. And then in Q1 we also pay our employee bonuses, the onetime per year. So there’s a number of events that occurred in Q1, which drove up the cash used to be to more than normally. But if you look at the past trend, typically our cash flow from operations is between $10 million to $15 million, which certainly seems reasonable going forward. So there was just a number of unusual events that occurred in the quarter, which were more timing-related or one-time related. And then in terms of the tax, we definitely did benefit from the tax. Again, we don’t pay tax necessarily quarterly, right? But we did see a very good benefit from the new U.S. corporate tax rate and we anticipate that quarterly benefit was around $2 million in Q1. But again, you wouldn’t necessarily see the cash benefit from that in Q1 because taxes are not paid necessarily every quarter.
John DiFucci: Okay. Okay, and then just one of the things you said there, Steve. Because the bonuses, I mean you pay that every year. The other things are one-timers, but that one is something that – I mean that happens every year at this time, right?
Steve Valenzuela: That’s right. That’s a quarterly Q1 event. I will say we did have more employees this year. Keep in mind, Q1 of last year we did not have the full years’ worth of employees from the acquisitions we did, which added over 100 employees. So the bonuses this year were higher than last year. But those events occur typically in the first quarter. We pay those out.
John DiFucci: Okay, great. And then if I can, Steve Trundle, so it’s kind of – we’ve been hearing a little bit about the opportunity in the SMB for a while now and it’s great to see that you’re sort of expanding there, actually actively going after that. But I’m trying to get a sense of the timing of this because you mentioned you had trained a bunch of service providers. I guess can you give a sense like how many are trained versus how many want to be trained? I mean I assume some service providers probably just stick with consumers. And then, did we see any of that benefit of pushing into this market in the outperformance this quarter? Or is that really yet on the come?
Steve Trundle: To answer the second question, I think it’s more or less still on the come line. So I think the earlier question about sort of percentage of service providers that we would train, we feel like 80% or more of our service providers have at least some commercial component of their business. It varies dramatically whether it’s sort of 5% or whether it’s 50%, or there are even a few new ones that are almost entirely, if not entirely, commercial-oriented. So we’re recruiting those folks. They don’t automatically want to be trained, though. I do want to be clear there. We have to do some marketing of the product. We have to do things, like the ISC West show, where we demonstrate the product. And we have to create some demand from the service providers and sort of win them over on the merits of the offering one by one, and then make sure the first couple of installations that they do goes pretty well. So I think we’ve beat the drumbeat. We’ve talked about commercial in the past, and it’s kind of an ongoing dialogue we’re maintaining. The things that occurred in the first quarter, though, or really shortly after the first quarter, were some tangible elements on the commercial side. First, I think we got more aggressive about distinguishing the brand of Alarm.com for Business and packaging things together correctly in a way that’s more fitting for a service provider, who is not just dabbling in commercial, but who wants to go win new business with their commercial offering. Second, we launched a set of new video cameras that were purposely built, explicitly or only intended, really, for the commercial type of installation. And I referenced those a minute ago. And then the third was, I think, the integration and the offering and the availability now of the access control component was a big move for us on the product side in the first quarter, running a pretty lengthy beta program in hopes that we’ve got the product right. And then, making that product available coincident with ISC West gives us really, we think, the first instance of a product where the intrusion piece, the access control piece, the video piece and the energy management piece were all built by a single company and all built with kind of seamless integration in mind. And that’s showing through now. At least in our early experiences, that’s showing through in the reaction that we’re getting to the user interface. Commercial folks are saying, ""Well, this is incredibly easy to use for what it does."" And that was our intent. So those were kind of the milestones in the first quarter. We haven’t – I don’t think we saw any material lift in the first quarter from the commercial offering. And I think it will actually take quarters, if not years, to unfold. It’s just sort of another tailwind for us, an element where we can build some growth as we go out and get the service providers trained and then executing efficiently.
John DiFucci: See, that’s really helpful, but it just begs my last question here. In your guidance for the year, and maybe this is for Steve Valenzuela, is it implied anywhere in there that there is this inflection point in this business? Because you just said it will take time, perhaps years. But I’m just curious if, in that guidance for the year, you’re anticipating any material uplift in the commercial business.
Steve Valenzuela: I would say typically modest. When we’re looking at new products or new offerings, we typically we’ll guide based on what we know today and have a little bit of modest potential there. But again, we like to include in our guidance kind of what we know. And the commercial offering is new. We actually just really introduced the Alarm.com for Business and Smarter Access Control in April. So it actually was in Q2. So I think it would be premature for us to really go out on the limb too much for the new offerings for 2018 in our guidance.
John DiFucci: That’s what I hoped you’d say.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Nikolay Beliov: Hi, thanks or taking my question. Question for Steve, Steve Trundle. Steve, I have a philosophical question for you. When you look at the lifetime of Alarm.com, it took you, I think, five to six years to get to 1 million residential subscribers. Then you got to 2 million in a period of a couple of years as the market crossed the chasm, if you will. When you look at the business going forward, both on the international side and commercial side as kind of the new growth levers for the company, is it reasonable to expect some sort of inflection in both or either one at some point? Is there like market demand trends or like things you’re doing on your side to kind of like cause that? Or it’s going to be like more gradual uptake versus the residential adoption curve that you saw in the past?
Steve Trundle: Yes. It relates a little bit to the last question, which is why we wouldn’t really drive guidance up when we announce a new product. And the reason is that, as I said, you go win service providers one by one. Then you make sure that their first installation is well done. And you’re basically building, if you will, a printing press that, with each new service provider, can sort of print extra newspapers. And it takes a while to get them built, but eventually you get them built and the volume of what you’re able to print is much higher. And that’s kind of what we’re always trying to do with service providers. So we do think that international and commercial – and for that matter, we still see nice growth residentially in North America. We think all of these things are going to contribute to, at least on an absolute basis, nice steady continued growth of the base of subscribers. But I don’t necessarily like to imply that there’s going to be, at some point, an inflection. But the counter to all of this is always, as the base gets larger, you’re obviously replacing a set of subscribers, as well, that are attriting on a routine basis so that creates a little bit of a headwind. But on the whole, we think with the breadth of the offering and the ongoing growth in North American residential as well as sort of adding on the commercial international and then some of the things we have going on in the subs give us enough different angles to attack the TAM, that we can continue to drive nice subscriber growth.
Nikolay Beliov: And a follow-up for Steve Valenzuela. Steve, can you give us an update on the other revenue line? What are the big buckets and what the growth rate – what was the growth there that you saw in the quarter?
Steve Valenzuela: Steve Valenzuela. You mean the other segment, when you say other line?
Nikolay Beliov: Correct.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, actually we saw good growth in the quarter in the other segment. SaaS revenue grew over 70% over the last Q1 of 2017, but it is off of a small number. It’s less than 5% of our overall revenue as we break that out in our Qs. But we’ve seen good growth. We didn’t really comment on it this quarter because we have so much going on with ISC West, with the new product announcements, but we’re seeing some good growth in the other segment.
Nikolay Beliov: Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Gabriela Borges: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on some of the DIY comments in the prepared remarks, and I want to talk specifically about DIY installation coupled with professional monitoring. So my question is for Steve Trundle. Are you seeing that in your dealer conversations comes up more, the dealers having that conversation come up more with their customers? And how do you think about Alarm.com’s ability to participate in that particular niche of the market particularly if it’s able to open up the TAM a little bit because of the price elasticity associated with lower installation costs?
Steve Trundle: Right. So does it come up with our service providers? It does come up in two different ways. One is service providers are anxious, in some cases, to participate more in the DIY market, which I would differentiate, by the way, from the retail market a bit. They consider providing a solution to the customer that is with professional-grade equipment that they then can support themselves that offers our service and that includes professional monitoring, and it’s a very curated kind of high-touch, high-service experience. And some have been very successful in that domain, and therefore we do reasonably well, I think, in what we call the DIY with pro monitoring segment with a few service providers in particular that have been strong performers there. The second discussion is sometimes, ""Well, are we worried about the retail products being overly predatory to the offering of the service provider? And how should the service provider respond?"" Most of that tends to be – there tends to be discussion about that, but when we look at the results, we find it to be sort of a good discussion, but not something that necessarily necessitates action. The service providers continue to find customers that want what they sell and want those things that I sort of talked about a few moments ago. So it tends to be more of kind of an abstract conversation.
Gabriela Borges: That makes sense. And as a follow-up, on the success that you’re having with the marketing spend that you’re upticking this year, how do you think about measure – well, how do you think about measuring the success on the marketing campaigns that you’ve put in place for this year? And what are some of the key messages that you’re focused on communicating in that marketing to consumers?
Steve Trundle: Yes. The measurement on marketing, especially if you’re in a channel or in a business – we don’t sell directly to customers so when we do marketing we’re not attempting to drive a lot of direct response activity. We want our service providers to be more successful selling. So it’s therefore hard for us to really get great measurements on the efficacy of the spend. That said, we do believe that – we have service providers all over the spectrum. Some are very small without any marketing budget. Others have meaningful marketing budgets and have really created a great brand in certain markets. So I think the things we hope to do are, first, we want to begin to get the word out on Alarm.com for Business. We feel like, much as we educated the market three, four, five years ago on what a smart home system with security should do, where we spent fairly heavily on that, we want to educate the small business owner in particular on what a smart business security system should do. And we feel like that’s going to take a mix of various formats to get that message out. And that will make it easier for our service provider to walk into that small business and make the sale if the owner has seen the brand and has seen the differentiation that we’re trying to drive. So that would be the first goal. The second would be to be a little more supportive. At this point, we don’t need to educate the residential consumer on what the IoT enables, but we do need to probably, in my opinion, do a better job informing them of the various paths to purchase that they can take and make sure that they’re aware of the ability to kind of go with a low-risk, kind of lower-effort deployment of their smart home system by contacting one of our service providers. So we likely will highlight some of the investments in time that one needs to make on a persistent basis to keep a system working, probably highlight some of the deficiencies in some of the other alternative products that are out there and again, give our – some of this is training the service provider personnel themselves. If you’re a salesperson at one of our dealers, you feel better about what you’re selling and you’re better equipped with the talking points to make the sale if the technology provider, which, in this case, is Alarm.com, is messaging those same points and you’re hearing them on the radio or you’re seeing them online. So we want to make sure we get those points across and that we’re amplifying some of the messages of our service providers. Then the last is really just, in certain markets at times, we will support a service provider with a co-marketing campaign that is partially branded Alarm.com. And that’s been successful. Our service providers can implement direct sort of calls to action so those become more measurable. And when we see those sort of being good investments, we’ll make them over and over. So those are the three real goals there.
Gabriela Borges: Do you have a sense for what the average lag time is between marketing dollars going up and subscriber growth going up?
Steve Trundle: I really don’t. That’s – it’s not – I don’t know that we’ll necessarily see it in the near term. I think if we had a lever like that that was sort of easily discernible and we could see that an incremental $5 million in marketing generated, six months hence, an extra 25,000 subscribers or something like that, then our job would be much easier and we’d be much more confident putting more investment on the marketing side. The reality of our business is things with the channel that we operate through, it takes a while and it’s very hard to measure exactly the source of the incrementally positive results.
Steve Valenzuela: Gabriela, I would say if you look at our marketing spending. Sorry. If you look at our marketing spending, typically the magic number is one and payback is 12 because the amount of marketing spending in a prior year is less than the actual incremental SaaS and license revenue we generate in the following year. So we typically have a very good payback period for marketing, but it’s hard to tell exactly of what programs are driving those numbers, but just give you an overall stat for marketing that we kind of look at.
Gabriela Borges: I appreciate the color. Thank you very much.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is now open,
Matt Pfau: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I was hoping if we could get an update on the international business and perhaps what geographies you’re seeing the most traction in. And then also you mentioned previously entering some new geographies this year, so maybe just an update on how that’s progressing as well.
Steve Trundle: Sure. Yes, good question, Matt. I didn’t touch upon that. But international has continued. I think I touched upon it a little bit after the fourth quarter that we were feeling better about the progress that our international team was making. We were beginning to see some of the what I had previously described as impedance in the system, some of that impedance being resolved in terms of getting the right ecosystem of products, the right actual hardware products and carriers integrated to support a wider number of markets and then to enable our service providers to have optimal installation experiences. So that’s going – continues to go pretty well. I believe, at this point, we’re in approximately 30 different geographies outside of North America. The dominant ones continue to be Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, and then I think we’re seeing some uptick now in Western Europe. We’ve talked in the past on this call about one partner in particular, which is Securitas, and it’s taken some time to really begin to get the deployments underway there, but I think they’re now underway in a few more markets. So we’re generally seeing a nice, expected but nice – it’s nice when you have an expectation and it actually occurs – an expected result from our international team. And to give you one data point, at this point, we’re over 100,000 subscribers outside of North America.
Matt Pfau: Got it. And then also wanted to hit on the commercial business. And so if you look at a lot of small businesses out there, I mean my guess would be most of them have a security system installed due to requirements from their insurance policy, most likely. So I guess when you think about your dealers going out there and targeting businesses and further penetrating smart systems into the commercial market, is it driven more by new business formation or businesses opening up new locations and then needing a security system? Or how do you get existing businesses with security systems to switch over to a smart system?
Steve Trundle: Right. So I think that the service providers will go to their existing base of subscribers. And it’s in the interest of our partner to try to drive higher value to their customer. And a couple of things now that are coming together that I believe, and we believe, can drive much higher value for a commercial customer are the combination of our access control offering and the video offering, particularly when you note that those capabilities can be tightly integrated with the intrusion system whether it’s new or existing. So I suspect therefore that there will be a lot of upsells on the existing base of commercial customers. But beyond that, it will be a mix. There are also new business formations, folks that maybe didn’t think they needed an intrusion system, but do need an access control system. So I think we’ll see kind of an overall mix. I think, though, that there is plenty of room in many existing small business accounts that may have an access – or, I’m sorry – an intrusion system that’s sort of a relic of the 1990’s to go in and say, ""Do you like what you have? Is it working for you? Does it add a lot of value to your business?"" and if the customer flinches on one of those questions, be in a position to present a much higher value proposition that would actually help them more effectively operate their business. So I think that’s what we’ll be doing.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you. And Thank you for taking my question. A question for Steve and one question for Steve Valenzuela. Getting back to commercial again. There is, I think most of the non-security marketplace doesn’t understand how much – what percentage of penetration there already is with regard to commercial. And as you said, it goes from 5% to 100%. Many, many of you, I think, of your better and mid-sized clients already have a significant amount of commercial in there. And they’ve bought from, in the past, they’ve bought from companies who claim to have integrated product, unified product. There’s a lot of words that go around it. It doesn’t always – these don’t always integrate. Sometimes they do. How are you going to go in there and get your value proposition across that it’s really easy, it’s really – it’s easy to install, easy to use? And up to what point can you push that value proposition?
Steve Trundle: Right. It’s a good question, Jeff. Yes, I think it starts actually with something I commented on in my prepared comments, which is what type of company are we in the way that we provide service to our service providers? Do they trust us? Are we the type of company they want to do business with? And my experience thus far and when I talk to the service providers is that the investments we are making in supporting our dealers are second to none. We really do try to work very hard on that. And that, before you ever get to the product features, often times that’s the most important thing. A person that’s out there trying to get an installation done or having a problem wants to know that a company they’re dealing with is going to treat it as a priority and get it resolved. So we’re lucky that we’ve built that reputation. It allows us to go to a service provider and start with that as the value proposition. Before we ever get to the features, we can talk about how much they like using the dealer site, how it makes their business better, how all the reporting we do makes their business better. And then they say, ""Well really, if Alarm.com is comparable even on some of these other features, all of the other value-add they’re doing for me justifies trying to put more in that basket."" That basket meaning the Alarm.com basket. And we start there and then, of course, we can get into some specific capabilities. And I think one of the things I highlighted in my comments is the ability, for example, to let a facility manager simultaneously manage codes on an intrusion panel and access to the facility all in sort of one integrated way is something that we’re not seeing too many other places. The ability to control a v-way block that may be appropriate for one facility in the context of the overall access control system is something we’re not seeing too many places. So we find those use cases. We get them to do at least one installation. And then hopefully, and what we’ve seen thus far, is that the installation is easy. That’s the most important thing. And they can envision it being easy for their consumers and we can begin to drive some replacements in that base.
Jeff Kessler: Okay, great. Steve Valenzuela, you began to talk a little bit about the other businesses. You folks mentioned one that seemed to be doing well. Could you go through – I mean you have a number of, quote-unquote, other businesses, some of which you talked a lot about last year, some of which you haven’t talked about lately. If you could just update us on everything from second homes to hotels to power, things like that.
Steve Valenzuela: Hi, Jeff. It’s Steve Valenzuela. Yes, within our other segment we have PointCentral, which provides unattended access for vacation rental property managers. And last quarter we actually announced a large REIT, the expansion of a large REIT with Invitation Homes, which we’re quite excited about. That will take some time to roll out. But PointCentral is doing quite well. Then we have EnergyHub, which provides an energy management system, demand response, energy management for the utilities. And that’s actually had a good contribution in the fourth quarter from a seasonal energy savings that comes in the summer, but we record it in the fourth quarter. And then, Building 36 with HVAC is a smaller piece of the other segment, but an opportunity we see given the opportunity to do some of the similar things we’ve done for security with HVAC. So we see good opportunities in all those other segments. Again, those are still very small and less than 5% of our overall revenue, but we are seeing a good growth, as I mentioned earlier in our call.
Jeff Kessler: Okay. One quick final question. For the providers, the service providers, their margin on installation for commercial industrial stuff, as we call it, is usually a real margin as opposed to an investment in a customer. Is there some type of financial model that you have to look at now when you talk to your service providers who may actually be making money on an installation?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So that’s a good question. They do typically have lower creation cost on a commercial installation. In some cases, I think what you’re alluding to is the actual integration of a bunch of disparate products can be a fairly profitable exercise so there may be some reluctance to take on a product that doesn’t drive that kind of less than necessary activity. But so far what we’ve seen, and again it’s early days, is when the – the service providers are busy. They don’t have much time. They’ve got – they’re constrained by the number of technicians they have. So generally speaking, when the service provider sees a more efficient path to get to a recurring revenue stream, even if that means perhaps he or she is able to do a little bit less integration work because it’s not necessary, they still will generally favor the product that gets them most efficiently to the recurring revenue stream. So I think we’ll probably be okay there.
Jeff Kessler: Okay, great. Thank you very much in quarter.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Gearhart with First Analysis. Your line is now open.
David Gearhart: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong quarter. So just on the last questions on the other business areas, just wondering if you can give me an update on the HVAC channel. I think you had mentioned before that you’ve signed up 40 to 50 dealers in HVAC to push your offerings, whether it’s Building 36 or energy management home automation. Just wondering if you could give us an update on the number of dealers and the traction you’re seeing there, even though it’s small.
Steve Trundle: Hi, David. Yes. The number of dealers, I don’t know if I have that data point in front of me. I probably can speak in generalities and just say that the team has been pretty busy with our next-gen smart thermostat, which – the Building 36 team, in addition to building their channel, is also sort of an expert group on how to develop a thermostat that will work with all of these different HVAC systems, which is then resold through the Alarm.com channel, through the PointCentral channel and others. So they’ve been somewhat occupied with that effort. They have continued to build their channel. I would say, though, that we still don’t feel that we have completely hit the nail on the head in terms of the platform that we are making available for them to take out to the market. So while we’re working with an ever-growing number of service providers there on the HVAC side, we’re not yet to the point where we really want to take a full swing, if you will, at that channel until we feel like we’ve got everything developed correctly. So you see some features that we’ve kind of alluded to. I think we talked, at some point, about HVAC safeguards as an example. Maybe that was at CES I believe we announced that capability. You can imagine that would be super valuable to that channel. And until you’re really putting it out there and you’re able to take sort of the first 50 to 100 service providers and get them successful with it, you don’t want to necessarily pile on a ton more. So it’s still, in that case, with that business, probably early days. And I would say that we’re still at a point where we’re intentionally constraining, at some level, the rate of growth of their dealer network until we feel like we’ve hit the nail on the head with the capability set.
David Gearhart: And then sticking with the channels, in the past, I think you’ve mentioned that there are some additional channels that you could target, whether it’s insurance. I think of smart entertainment or areas like that, that could be an interesting channel, whether it’s audio/visual dealers and what not. Just wondering if you can give us quick thoughts around alternative channels or just enough on your plate an opportunity that not really looking to add on anything at this point.
Steve Trundle: Yes. I think we’re always open-mined about new kind of channel opportunities. We do apply a kind of an economic filter to each opportunity. So two that you’ve referenced; insurance, we think there is tremendous value in the data that we are able to generate from a home. And we think that that data set can make not only the customer safer, more aware of their property, but also can allow the insurance company to be more precise in how they underwrite a property. So there we think there’s a ton of economic value that can be generated with various types of partnerships. And particularly outside of the U.S., our international team has been successful in cultivating and then closing a couple of partnerships that do exactly that. A/V and that sort of thing, I think the A/V space is a little bit more crowded. It is almost purely an automation play. And I think we need to provide ample functionality to sort of allow the customer to control everything in their home. But I likely would not move to drive to really fully adopt that channel. We haven’t come up with a play that we think passes the economic filter to justify heavy investment in A/V, as an example.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Adam Tindle: Okay, thanks, good afternoon. Steve, you alluded to the retail lifetime value of a customer being low and maybe not even positive in that space. What is it for Alarm.com new subs? And can you maybe tie that into justifying increased spending or customer acquisition costs in light of that?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. This is Steve Valenzuela. We’ve looked at the LTV to CAC ratio. Typically over six for us. And the lifetime value of our subscribers tends to be quite long. Usually they will start with a 36-month or a 60-month contract and they will then tend to renew. We have a high renewal rate. So we actually believe that there is a good amount of average eight to 10-year life for a typical subscriber. Of course, there is churn that does occur from time to time. But I think we’re pretty lucky that we have such a high revenue retention rate.
Adam Tindle: Okay, that’s helpful. And there was a question earlier regarding ADT. I just wanted to ask about that. Just to clarify, they’re investing in a lot of the new commercial offering. Are they using Connect or Alarm.com for that? Can you help us with that? And if not Alarm.com, why not, with what would appear to be a new offering?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So a couple different things there on that question, Adam. In terms of what ADT is using, as I think we’ve, in the past, said that there is use of both the traditional Alarm.com platform and the Connect platform. That continues to be the case. It varies a bit by, at times, even by their dealer. So that – and some of their dealers in some part of their business may use Alarm.com for commercial. Other parts are still primarily on the Connect platform. And Connect, at the moment, we have not implemented a commercial set of capabilities on the Connect, but they’re more than likely using the residential plans, which still offer quite a bit of capability for a small business on the Connect side. In terms of their direction, we obviously would hope to have the opportunity to work with ADT if we can add value to their commercial strategy, but I can’t say, at this point, that they’ve gone through any sort of RFP or otherwise, and that we’ve won any incremental new business there that’s tied specifically to commercial.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Dillon Heslin: This is Dillon on for Darren and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch really quickly on international and see if you – sort of what your outlook is there, if you’ve made any progress. Or sort of a lot of the investment has been on commercial in rolling that out and then also the access control updates. And then also with sort of some of your video products, you’ve had machine learning implemented, and I was wondering if there’s also some new use cases there with machine learning across the whole platform.
Steve Trundle: Sure. On the international side, I had a question on that a little earlier and went into some detail on that. We are making progress. It continues to be growing. The geographies are expanding. So generally positive there, feeling pretty positive on the – this quarter, I think with the breadth of announcements we had at ISC West, it made sense for us to focus a little bit more on what we’re doing. And each quarter we’ll focus on something different, but this quarter the timing was right to spend some time on the commercial offering. With regard to machine learning and AI, in a sense, Alarm.com has long implemented at least some form of machine learning. We’re collecting a ton of data about a ton of different properties and then, in some cases, making predictions based upon that data set even before we get to video. Currently, the focus, though, is very much on video analytics and convolutional neural network deployments on the edge in the devices. So that’s where most of the AI/machine learning type of investments are being made. And we’ve talked about the capacities of the team we acquired from ObjectVideo to work in that domain, and they’re making good progress and we’re excited about some of the things that we hope to deploy later this year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Rushif [ph] for Mike Latimore. Thanks for taking my call. What percent of hardware sales included alarm radio in this quarter?
Steve Valenzuela: I’m sorry. The question was hardware sales in the quarter?
Steve Trundle: Hardware sales where the Alarm.com manufactured radio was included.
Steve Valenzuela: Oh, I see. Okay. I got you. Okay. Yes, we actually haven’t broken that out in the past. I think what you’re alluding to, perhaps, is we’ve talked about the modules. Some modules going forward will be embedded in some control panels. We didn’t see a major change in the quarter. We said we would expect to see more of that impact in the second quarter for hardware revenue.
Steve Trundle: Yes. I guess would probably – we don’t have that data point directly in front of us, but I think what we said is if we rolled the clock back a couple years, about half of the new installations were coming with the radio manufactured by Alarm.com. We saw that dropping to something in the 35% to 40% range, and that trend is underway but didn’t impact us much in the first quarter. We expect it, though, to kind of continue at a slow pace, to see a higher percentage of accounts on a going-forward basis likely coming from controls that where we’re not making the radio.
Unidentified Analyst: And one more on the commercial side. So do you see you commercial offering exceeding 5% of revenue by this year end?
Steve Trundle: I am guessing, but the guess would be no, given the base that we have and given the place where we are with the product at the moment. I would not expect 5% to be from commercial, no.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Vander Aarde with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Jack Vander Aarde: Steve V., you provided Connect SaaS revenue for the first time in a while. Did I hear you correctly, it was $9.1 million?
Steve Valenzuela: The actual number for Connect revenue for Q1 was $9.9 million compared to $2.3 million in the quarter last year.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay. So that’s ahead of my kind of internal estimate. I just want to touch upon the kind of the ARPU/subscriber dynamic with Connect. Is there a – is that solely driven by subscriber growth? Or is there ARPU lifts in/ARPU growth within the Connect subscriber base?
Steve Valenzuela: There are different levels of plans in terms of various different levels of plans for the Connect platform. But again, keep in mind, as I said on the prepared remarks that Connect we license the software to our service providers, for the most part, and the service providers have to incur the whole hosting, their people, managing the service, the cellular fees. And so it’s a different type of deployment than an Alarm.com platform offering from our other service providers.
Steve Trundle: So within the world, though, of that software, a customer that takes, for example, a rich video subscription would be on a different plan than a subscriber who is really just doing interactive security or interactive security and automation.
Jack Vander Aarde: Got it. So that holds true for both the core Alarm platform and the Connect platform then?
Steve Trundle: That’s correct.
Jack Vander Aarde: And then just a follow-up for Steve T. With over, I think you mentioned over 100,000 subscribers are located outside North America. Are international subscribers entirely supported by the Alarm core platform? Or is there any Connect mix in there?
Steve Trundle: That’s 100% Alarm.com.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay, thanks. And then are the ARPU pricing dynamics between Alarm North America and international dealers the same in terms of like the basic plan per month that Alarm receives and then premium ARPU lifts for attached services?
Steve Trundle: Generally in the same ballpark and definitely the same structure.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay. But the dollar amounts might vary?
Steve Trundle: You get into like currencies. Obviously, the size of service provider, I think, is probably more of an impact than the market. But, as is the case, even in North America across service providers, there will be variance. But we’re not really doing kind of market-specific pricing schedules.

The webcast of this call will be archived, and a telephone replay will also be available on our website. With these formalities out of the way, I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve Trundle. You may begin.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, David, and welcome to everyone joining our call today. We’re pleased to report another solid quarter that exceeded our expectations. SaaS and license revenue in the second quarter was $71 million, up 20.4% from $58.9 million in Q2 of 2017. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $23.4 million, up 47% over last year. Our service provider partners continued to compete effectively in the market and were more successful in the second quarter than we anticipated. Most potential residential and business customers continue to demonstrate a preference for a professional-grade smart security solution that comes with the commitment to ongoing service and support from a reputable provider. I want to thank the Alarm.com team as well as their service providers for their contribution to our positive results. This is the first quarter in our company’s history that we have exceeded $100 million in total revenue. On today’s call, I want to update you on a few of our business initiatives and recent product introductions. As most of you know, we continuously integrate new hardware and peripheral devices into our ecosystem. This gives us an ever improving set of intelligent, useful and convenient capabilities for the subscriber. It also equips our service providers with an expanding set of solutions to market and sell. This quarter, we launched a new smarter heating control solution that integrates a number of new devices. It provides an easy retrofit for boiler systems that are popular in Europe. The hardware kit includes a new EU version of the Alarm.com Smart Thermostat as well as third-party devices for managing hot water cylinders and individual radiators for room-to-room temperature control. Domestically, we introduced the integration of the DSC iotega from Johnson Controls. The iotega is a versatile headless security control panel for residential installations. We also expanded our portfolio of smart locks with the addition of the Yale Assure, Kwikset Convert as well as the August Smart Lock Pro for customers who don’t want to change their existing door hardware. Earlier this year, we introduced the Danalock V3 for the European market. As we grow our ecosystem, our service providers tend to expand the range of solutions that they offer so they can service more of the market. Next, I want to talk about the home builder program that we announced during the second quarter. As I have mentioned on previous calls, new homebuyers tend to have a high adoption rate on smart security and automation systems. Many of our service providers work with builders and their local market, and one of our goals is to help facilitate these partnerships. Our program gives builders a full range of support through efficiently deploying smart home solutions in new home communities. The best-in-class hardware products in our ecosystem allow builders to tailor solutions to the target buyers and the design aesthetic of a given community. Working with one of our service provider partners, builders can also minimize the risk and cost of deploying new smart home technology. Our service providers manage the required product inventory, install and configure the systems and then service the systems through years after the builder has delivered the property and move-in has occurred. Early in the second quarter, we also launched our new commercial platform, Alarm.com for Business, including our new Smarter Access Control solution. I discussed this initiative on our last quarterly call and, I want to give a brief update on our progress. As a reminder, our commercial platform integrates interactive security, video surveillance, access control and energy management into a unified, intelligent solution. It’s designed to address the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. We see a meaningful opportunity for our service provider partners to attack this segment in both the domestic and international markets. Since launching our commercial platform in April, we have initiated marketing, sales and training activities to increase awareness with our service provider partners. While interest is strong and sales are beginning to flow, it was not the reason for our outperformance in the second quarter. It typically takes a longer period of sustained solid execution to get our partners comfortable with routinely selling and installing new products like the Alarm.com commercial platform. Next, I want to touch on marketing. As we discussed on our last call, we proceeded to execute our plan to increase our marketing presence this quarter. We are focused on a couple of things in our marketing initiatives. First, we want to properly launch and raise awareness for our commercial platform. There, we are focused on the security channel. Second, we want to better position our service providers and our technology with home and small business owners. Here, we are focused on the consumer. We are educating them about the value of our more robust integrated solution and our go-to-market approach. Our message often distinguishes the benefits of working with our service provider partners. We believe that these efforts help our service providers as they engage in sales discussions with potential customers. I also want to update you on some of our longer-term growth initiatives. Beginning with our international business, we see continued progress and momentum. We reached the total of 100,000 active international accounts during the second quarter, not including Canada. Today, we have 151 active service provider partners in 37 countries outside of North America. Our services are currently localized for 40 countries. This quarter, our services launched in South Africa through ADT Fidelity. ADT Fidelity is the leading security provider in South Africa, with approximately 35% of the residential intrusion market. We also continued to expand in Europe through our partnership with Securitas and others. Our European presence now includes Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden and Norway. One other new partnership I want to highlight is our relationship with Aviva. Aviva is a large European insurance company with more than 33 million customers globally. They will introduce Aviva Smart Home, a professionally installed and monitored smart home security solution in Ireland this fall. Our partnership with Aviva is built around a first-of-its-kind application for IoT services. Many insurance providers have offered discounts and affinity programs for smart home security products. Aviva sees a broader opportunity in offering an Aviva-branded and customized solution that is tailored to their policyholders. With our full scope of advanced property protection capabilities, Aviva’s solution can take preventative action to reduce claims while also generating more customer engagement. To give you a better feel for the growing breadth of our global presence, our updated investor deck now includes a list of some of our key service providers, along with links to some of their marketing assets. We founded the company based on the idea that people universally value peace of mind and protection for their loved ones. It’s gratifying to see the diverse range of brands that are echoing this message and the values of our technology to a growing global market. We also operate several growing subsidiary businesses that we report in our Other segment. This includes PointCentral, Building 36 and EnergyHub. Their SaaS and license revenue grew 59% in the second quarter. EnergyHub recently announced that it will manage National Grid’s full-scale bring your own device demand response program. National Grid is one of the largest investor-owned utilities in the world with more than 3 million homes in its target market in the Northeast. The program will leverage the breadth of EnergyHub’s Mercury platform by including multiple device categories, including residential battery energy storage. We continue to see solid ongoing progress with all of our long-term growth initiatives. We will continue to update you as these efforts further develop and contribute to our growth trajectory. To summarize, we’re pleased with our performance this quarter, thanks again to our service provider partners and the Alarm.com team for their hard work and to our investors for their faith in our business. And with that, let me turn things over to Steve Valenzuela. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a review of our second quarter 2018 financial results and then provide guidance for the third quarter and our raised outlook for the full year of 2018, before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the second quarter grew 20.4% from the same quarter last year to $71 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $10.2 million for the second quarter compared to $8.5 million for Q2 2017. This is the first full quarter for Connect revenue and the comparable year-ago period as we closed the acquisition of Connect toward the end of Q1 2017. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 94% in the second quarter, at the high end of our historical range of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenues in the second quarter was $33.5 million compared to $27.1 million for Q2 2017. The increase in hardware sales in the second quarter was primarily due to an increase in sales of our video cameras and, to a lesser extent, an increase in sales of thermostat and our system enhancement modules. Q2 is typically our strongest quarter for hardware sales going into the summer selling season. Total revenue of $104.5 million for the second quarter grew 21.5% from Q2 2017. SaaS and license gross margin for the second quarter was 84.5%, consistent with our gross margin in the sequential quarter, and down slightly from the same quarter last year. Hardware gross margin was 24% for the second quarter compared to 21% for the same quarter last year. We expect hardware margins to moderate in the future, consistent with our historical range of 20% to 22%. Total gross margin was 65% for the second quarter, comparable to the same quarter last year. Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses in the second quarter were $21.5 million compared to $20.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, as we continued our planned investment in R&D, given the significant opportunities we see in our markets. We ended the second quarter with 466 employees in R&D, up from 429 employees in the same quarter last year. We expect to add more employees in R&D in the third quarter as university hires come on board. Total headcount increased to 828 employees compared to 750 employees at the end of Q2 2017. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter were $14.6 million or 14% of total revenue compared to $11.9 million or 13.8% of revenue in the same quarter last year. As we previously indicated, we are investing in sales and marketing to promote our new Alarm.com for Business and Smarter Access Control products, and we initiated more general marketing programs designed to raise the stature and awareness of service providers who offer Alarm.com. We plan to continue these investments in the second half of 2018, consistent with our prior guidance for sales and marketing expense to be approximately 14% to 15% of total revenue for 2018. G&A expenses in the second quarter were $18.1 million compared to $13.5 million in the year-ago quarter. G&A expense includes non-ordinary course litigation expense of $6.1 million in the second quarter compared to $1.3 million in Q2 2017. Non-ordinary course litigation expenses are part of our adjusted measures and are excluded from our measurement of our non-GAAP financial performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $23.4 million in the second quarter, up 47% from $15.9 million in the same quarter last year. In the second quarter, GAAP net income increased to $10.7 million compared to $9.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income increased to $60.8 million in the second quarter compared to $10.7 million for the second quarter of 2017. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $106 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $11.7 million of cash flow from operations with $8.6 million in free cash flow. We prepaid about $10.9 million to secure component supply in the first half of 2018. We expect to convert most of these prepayments to cash in the second half of 2018. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect Q3 SaaS and license revenue of $72.2 million to $72.4 million. We are increasing our expectations for full year 2018 SaaS and license revenue to be between $286 million to $286.5 million, up from our prior outlook for SaaS and license revenue of $284 million to $284.5 million. We are also raising our guidance for total revenue for 2018 to $388 million to $390.5 million, up from our prior guidance of $381.5 million to $383.5 million. This includes our increased guidance for hardware and other revenue of $102 million to $104 million, compared to our prior guidance of $97.5 million to $99 million. We expect Q3 hardware revenue to be sequentially lower than Q2, coming off a seasonably strong Q2. We also expect hardware revenue for Q4 to be seasonally lower than Q3, consistent with historical trends. We are increasing our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2018 to be between $85.1 million to $85.9 million, up from our prior guidance of $82.5 million to $83.2 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower in Q3 and Q4 compared to Q2, reflecting our planned investments in marketing and R&D, which is in line with our full year guidance. We therefore expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be sequentially lower than Q2, and Q4 to be seasonally higher than Q3 by approximately 7% to 8%. We are also raising our guidance for non-GAAP net income for 2018 to $59.4 million to $59.9 million or $1.19 to $1.20 per diluted share, up from our prior guidance of $57 million to $57.5 million or $1.14 to $1.15 per diluted share. This is based on our non-GAAP tax rate of 21% as we have previously indicated. EPS is based on an estimate of 50 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, and we expect full year 2018 stock-based compensation expense of $11.5 million to $12 million. In conclusion, we are pleased with our performance for the first half of 2018. We are excited about the opportunities ahead for us and our service providers. We are continuing to invest in our business to capitalize on the expanding opportunities enabled by the Internet of Things and the intelligently connected property. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And with that, operator, please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.
Nikolay Beliov: Hi, thanks for taking the question. If you can please give us some more color on what caused the outperformance in the quarter.
Steve Valenzuela: Hey, Nikolay. Steve speaking. Yes. I think that what we saw is dealers are generally feeling positive about their markets. They’re feeling fairly positive about the economy. And I think we saw some just increased purchase levels of the same product portfolio. So as I noted in my comments, not really driven by the commercial launch but just the broad range of cameras, the thermostat, all – higher sales than we anticipated. I think our service providers want to make sure that they’ve got product on the shelf going into the summer and that they’re well-equipped. So those are not really a specific answer I realize, but those are some general trends that I guess we saw.
Nikolay Beliov: Okay. And a follow-up to the equivalent. So Steve, 20% subscription revenue growth, clearly, very strong. You’re guiding to 17% in Q3. Is there other seasonal factors you’re baking into guidance? Or is it being conservative?
Steve Valenzuela: Well, we always have to consider there could be SLA requirements that we have to be careful when we guide. I think if you look at Q2, when we guided Q2 SaaS, the growth was also about 17% year-over-year, and we came in at 20%. Now that being said, we just have to be cautious with our guidance here. There are things that could occur that have occurred in the past that could affect our SaaS revenue.
Nikolay Beliov: Got it. And my last question is for Steve Trundle. Steve, you are the first one seller, then you were the first one to adopt LTE. Any preliminary thoughts on how 5G might change your business and how you guys can take advantage of that?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So there are number of things on the networking side going on right now. There’s 5G, there’s CATM and then there’s low ra – or low-frequency long range, mesh wireless networking. And we’re working in all sort of three of those domains. I think the more immediate impact that we’ll see is really CATM, which is a low-powered version of LTE that you can envision enabling us to reach locations where there may not be a power supply, there may not be a hub, et cetera. So there’s a fair amount of focus there as well as on CATM, there’s a more modest cost structure in both the equipment and on low volume data transport prepayments. With 5G, I think 5G is a little further out. I think, though, the ambitions we have around 5G are to be able to give our service providers a wider range of flexibility when they go in and sell in high-bandwidth IoT devices like high-def video cameras. So there, I think, we’re waiting on the bandwidth and the cost and really the deployment. Sometimes, these marketing terms, by the way, get kicked around years in advance of when they’re actually in market. And we’re only as good as the breadth of the deployment of these technologies. But with 5G, our hope will be that if you’re a service provider and you’re installing a new home that doesn’t yet have, for example, a consumer in there with a broadband connection and you want to enable all the services so that you can confirm their home is done, you could do it with a 5G version of our product set and even accommodate the higher bandwidth parts of the application. So those are a few of the things that I think we’re excited about there.
Nikolay Beliov: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.
Adam Tindle: Okay. Thanks, and good afternoon. First question for Steve Trundle. I know there’s been a lot of noise in the competitive landscape this quarter. So I just wanted to ask if you saw any level of customer pausing ahead of the Amazon Ring security product in the quarter, or impact so far in Q3 now that, that’s completely go live? And I’d imagine, a little based on your results and guidance, but wanted to confirm, and maybe if you could help sort of tie that in to comparing this versus your early experience with Google’s Nest acquisition years ago?
Steve Trundle: Yes. Good question, Adam. I don’t want to appear cavalier, but in both cases, both the Nest thing years ago and then the most recent announcement, the biggest impact was really the number of questions we got at the time of announcement and some time we invested in answering the questions. In terms of what our service providers see in the market, we haven’t seen any impact. I think the quarter is evidence that they’re feeling pretty good about their markets and their customer base hasn’t evolved in any way from either the Nest stuff or the Amazon stuff. And I think that’s just consistent with what we stated, which is we really think the market is pretty broad and there are different segments of the market. There are folks that are looking to add a device to their apartment, and then there are other families that are worried about the overall quality protection and safety in their property and want to really invest in their home. And we cater to the latter crowd. I think that’s probably who we’ve been catering to through the years, and that group, we haven’t seen any changes in their behavior.
Adam Tindle: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on guidance as well. In the back half, the EBITDA margin is coming down a little bit after a very strong first half, and you alluded to some of the reasons for that. I guess, the question would be the SaaS growth line is also implied, the slow to kind of the mid-teen sort of a level on a year-over-year basis. Why wouldn’t we see an acceleration if the investments start increasing, or maybe there’s an aspect of timing here where the growth comes later that we might not fully appreciate. Just any help on kind of the dislocation between those two things. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Yes. Adam, that’s definitely some timing. As we’ve talked about for the commercial, it just take time to really have that roll through the dealers to have the service provider partners get trained. And so it’s fair to say there’s not much of that in the 2018 guide. Also, we have to take into account, too, from a revenue point of you, as I indicated, typically, you see seasonality for hardware, for example, coming down – being seasonably slow, especially in the fourth quarter. And then, we have to take into account for SaaS and license. We have to, when we guide, factor in that there can be some disruptions that can occur, like SLA requirements that we’ve seen very occasionally, but it has happened in the past. So we have to factor that in. And then, when you look at EBITDA, we are increasing our investment in sales and marketing and we’re increasing our investment in R&D. So if you look at kind of the first half of 2018, we didn’t have a full complement of R&D hires, especially now that university hires have come on board. So we’ll have more folks in R&D in the second half of the year. And from a sales and marketing point of view, Q1 was fairly light on sales and marketing. Q3 and Q4 will be higher on sales and marketing, consistent with our guidance for overall sales and marketing for 2018 to be about 14% to 15% of revenue. That said, we did increase the guidance for adjusted EBITDA for the year quite nicely. And if you look at the 2017 adjusted EBITDA, we came in at about 21.1%. And with the midpoint of the guide here of about $85.5 million for adjusted EBITDA for 2018, we’re taking that up to 22%. So almost 100 basis points.
Adam Tindle: Understood, makes sense. That’s helpful, Steve. Thank you very much.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, Adam.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks, Adam.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair.
Matt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And just wanted to first hit on the insurance partnership that you signed with Aviva. So I guess, interesting first that the first partnership that you signed, at least that I’m aware of from the insurance perspective, is in the international region. So maybe you can touch on how that evolved? And then, I guess, more broadly, what’s the opportunity for additional insurance partnerships? And how many of these may you have in place already?
Steve Trundle: Sure. I think, in some cases, we opined that the – on the insurance side, that the international markets oftentimes have slightly different regulatory environment, and at times, we’re seeing just more innovative kind of concepts outside of the U.S. as it relates to insurance. So Aviva, I think, it really occurred because they had a team that thought differently about what they could do with the IoT and how that might relate to the way they render services and premiums to their customers. And what’s different about it is just the concept of a branded Aviva offering with a focus on encouraging or highly encouraging deployment of pieces of technology that actually have the potential to reduce risk premiums. So they are still working with a local service provider, and that service provider has also been very kind of progressive in the way they put this program together. So we’re excited about it. We don’t – it’s early days and it’s too early to know just how well they’re do – they’ll do, but I would say they’re very committed to it and they appear to be doing something that very novel in our view. And we’ll be thrilled if we saw adoption of similar types of programs elsewhere, particularly in partnership with our service providers. It’s too early, though, for us to say that we got a full pipeline of similar types of deals across the globe. We don’t. We’re in discussions with various other parties that kind of have similar attributes that we of course would be. But we’re going to focus on Aviva in the near term, and make sure we do everything we can to help them be successful with the program.
Matt Pfau: Got it. And then, last one for me. Maybe you could just give us an update on what the video uptake of new customers is looking like and how that has trended versus prior quarters, given part of the hardware outperformance in the quarter was due to the video cameras. And then, I believe, at least your slim line video Doorbell Camera has been on back order with most dealers for quite some time. So it seems like demand there has been healthy. So maybe just an update on the video uptake.
Steve Trundle: Yes. You definitely did your research. So I’d say, quarter-over-quarter, the video attachment was really sort of consistent. If you look back over kind of a longer continuum of time, video attachment has trended up certainly since if you go back into the 2015 and 2016 time frame. And then, also, we’re seeing a higher percentage of the base. I may have commented this on a prior call, but a higher percentage of base coming back and saying I’d like to add video to my system now, so some sales into existing customers also happening now. In the second quarter, as you noted, and unfortunately, we have to acknowledge, we did have some supply chain issues particularly around the video camera for the door slim line product. And I would say that hampered some of the attachment of video that we might have otherwise seen in the second quarter, but not in a way that affected our results.
Matt Pfau: Got it. That’s it for me, guys. Thanks a lot.
Steve Trundle: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies.
John DiFucci: Thank you. I have a question for Steve Trundle and then a follow-up for Steve Valenzuela. Steve Trundle, my question is on the builder program. I just want to make sure that I understand this. These relationships are still going to be owned by the service providers, the relationships with the builders themselves? But you also said in the press release when that came out that Toll Brothers are already uses Alarm.com. So in that case, is Toll Brothers the acting service provider? Or is there some – are there others involved depending upon where homes are being built throughout the country? And I guess, my last question is related to that is, how do you encourage that? Like how do you – if – and I believe you always want to have those service providers involved, so I believe they’re probably going to – that’s going to be the answer, but how do you get those guys to really – this is all new for them, there’ll be new relationships, how do you make it happen?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So good set of questions and it requires that I distinguish Toll Brothers from some of the other builders. So let me start with that and then come back to kind of the broader vision for builders. Toll Brothers is a bit unique in that they’re actually a service entity themselves. So they own a security division. They have for years. This isn’t a new thing. They made a decision some period of time ago that they would operate a security division that services their model homes as well as their new customers. And therefore, they’re more like – I think they bought a security company probably to enable that. They’re more like a traditional service provider to us that is just highly affiliated with a builder, being – meaning Toll Brothers. But I would put them in a little different bucket than other builders where the builder is not simultaneously engaged in being a security service provider. And this program that we’ve announced is more focused on a vision of getting builders to specify into every home some piece of the Alarm.com ecosystem or multiple pieces of the Alarm.com ecosystem. And ideally, it’s not a buyer option. It’s something that just comes with the home. And luckily, we encourage it some, but the consumer is encouraging the builder to make – the builder needs to distinguish a new home from a legacy home, and an integrated set of smart home components can be a distinguishing characteristic that’s attractive to the consumer. So the demand is there from the builder. And then, the trick is for us, I think, we benefit from a fairly fragmented service provider base, but at times, it makes us – difficult for us to put on sort of a unified face to a builder, particularly a national builder. So in this case, we’re not servicing, no. The service provider is always brought in to the relationship or the builders introduce the various service providers and then the service providers compete for the relationship. But we’re really more focused on with the builder, marketing and selling the merits of our platform and the versatility of the platform to scale from simple smart home applications like automating lights and the thermostat and the garage door to moving on up and to an integrated automation and security solution to moving on up with integrated audio, energy, video and automation. So we’re promoting the merit to the technology. If the builder then adopts and standardizes on the Alarm.com ecosystem, it benefits all of our service provider partners. And they, in turn, work with the builder to iron out the mechanics. And they add a lot of value to the builder as well. And as I put in my comments, they derisk the smart home process for the builder. And we have partners that are national in scale that can work with national builders and we have local partners that work with locals. And we’ve put a few setups in place to make it more valuable for our service providers to compete with us for that builder business.
John DiFucci: Okay. That’s great. That all makes sense and that’s clear. And I guess, Steve Valenzuela, I would’ve thought that cash flow would’ve increased year-over-year. It would’ve been a little stronger than it was this quarter, not that – it’s flat year-to-year. But it – and it looks like accounts receivables jumped. And I don’t know, can you just help us understand what’s going on in cash flow in this quarter? I know we shouldn’t look at it just on a quarterly basis, but we hope you could also do that.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure, John. Yes. So we did prepay about $10.9 million for inventory in the first half of the year for component supply. Some parts are becoming long lead time and we talked about some of supply disruption with our video doorbell. So we wanted to prepay that. So that came out of cash and it’s not converted yet. We do expect to convert most of that to cash in the second half of 2018. So I would expect that the second half of 2018’s free cash flow should be higher than the second half of 2017, with the caveat that litigation-related costs are not predictable, and those, of course, affect cash. But if you look at – as you pointed out, if you look at the first half of 2018, we have free cash flow of about $9 million. A year ago, we had $19 million. So if we didn’t have the prepayment of inventory, we would have been about flat. And for the second half of 2018, if you look at it compared to 2017, we had about $28 million of free cash flow for 2017. So I expect that to be up, let’s say, about 10% to 12% 2018 – for the second half of 2018 for free cash flow, again, with the caveat not all factors are easily determinable when it comes to cash flow.
John DiFucci: Yes. But like you said, it would’ve been flat. But even then, I would have thought it would grow. I mean, the business is doing really well and earnings are growing. And like I said, you did have working capital here that was – I’m not sure why accounts receivable jumped in this particular quarter. It jumped by a lot more than it usually does, at least it looks on a seasonal basis.
Steve Valenzuela: What happened there, John, was we had a strong outperformance in the hardware sales, and so what happened is that tended to be more nonlinear toward the end of the quarter. So our AR DSOs were 46 days in Q2 compared to 43 days Q1 of 2018, and we expect that to convert to cash in the second half, in Q3. So that’s why we’re guiding or indicating for the second half of 2018, the free cash flow to actually be higher in the second half of 2018 compared to the second half of 2017. So that was a temporary – when you have such hardware sales versus SaaS, which is tends to be linear, hardware is not as linear and that affects your AR and your DSOs because if we have more of those sales back-ended, you don’t have time to collect within the payment period. So it’s more of a timing difference. So hopefully that helps you.
John DiFucci: Yes. That’s helps a lot, Steve. Thank you very much. Nice job guys.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.
Jeff Kessler: And Steve, about a year ago, you absconded, or I should say, bought a whole bunch of talents from ObjectVideo, all their human assets, so to speak. And since then, we haven’t heard much about them. You’ve been hiding them somewhere on sand or rock, without us even – they’ve been obviously doing some work for you, but I’m just wondering if you could update us the types of things that are coming out of video analytics, skunkworks at Alarm.com?
Steve Trundle: Sure, Jeff. Yes. So we’re very pleased with the team, obviously, that we were able to acquire from ObjectVideo. And we’re kind of in between skunkworks and deployment at this moment, I would say. So our goals for video analytics have been really to make the quality of the alerts even more relevant to the consumer and to make sure that we’re recording things that matter. And by being intelligent and training a set models around video, we can be more intelligent in the delivery of content to the consumer. And the bigger, the more data you have in those models, the more model powerful the model become. So that’s kind of what we’re trying to achieve there. And I guess, the update is we’re testing externally certain amounts of optionality right now and are not going to put it into our standard offering until such time that it’s ready, but we’re making progress. I’d love to have it out already, but we don’t. But the team is heads down working hard against the set of internal deadlines to get a release of our residential analytics package out this year.
Jeff Kessler: Okay. Your other businesses were up 59%. And I realize you’re talking about a small number, but could you give us some more color with regard to those businesses since they obviously could become material at some point in the future?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So I think I highlighted a bit more on EnergyHub in my comment. They recently won a nice deal with National Grid. Their business is expanding from being really a thermostat-driven type of DVR program to being a program that enables a utility to manage load coming from a wider variety of consumer devices, including, I think, I put in the note or in my comments, even battery chargers where being selective about – or battery being selective about what time you actually recharge a residential battery can have a meaningful impact on load for utilities. So they’re managing a whole array of diverse forces in the field. The business is clicking along. I think, we’re beginning to realize the vision we have for EnergyHub when we acquired it. And the other one is PointCentral is focused on unattended access and at times unattended delivery, but really drilling down and focused on making it easier for people who are going on vacation and going to be staying in a vacation home or making it easier for a REIT that owns a lot of rental properties to remotely manage energy consumption, temperature and really awareness and access of all of those properties. So they’re not really delivering a security solution per se, but there’s – they’re evidence of a need – they’re evidence of us taking the platform, which is primarily sold as a security platform and position it more as a base IoT platform for certain vertical applications that have more nuanced requirement. And PointCentral is building on that and they’re a big contributor to that number. And then, the last one I talked about the past in that segment is our HVAC business. And I’m still at the point where I have to say the same thing, which is that business is still more in its nascent phase where we’re seeing demand but we’re building a channel. And what we’re trying to do there is take the concept of remote monitoring and apply it to everyone’s HVAC system and protect people from outages, help the service provider know when a unit may need service, that sort of thing. So all are kind of novel concepts and making good progress, I would say.
Jeff Kessler: One of the – I guess, one of the questions that are being asked a lot is about, I would say, technology that is being developed inside the monitoring center itself, more analytics obviously, eventually moving toward AI, which some people think of as a threat to the traditional dealer if everything else is equal and everything else is a commodity. Is there a way for you to work with the technology that is being developed or spent on monitoring centers given that a lot of your clients are going to have to probably upgrade their own monitoring centers over time?
Steve Trundle: Right. So kind of two parts. One, is AI a threat to the traditional business of our service providers? And we don’t believe it is. We think it enhances the range of capabilities that our service providers can yield to a consumer. And at the end of the day, the reason – one of the reasons we’re successful is if the customer wants service first. And service sometimes can be AI. But more often than not, it’s more rudimentary. It’s I need someone to come get this thing working in the next day or two. So our guys – our team is good at that. With regard to how we partner with the central stations, yes, we’re always open to leveraging the assets that a central station has in a way that would result in better functionality for the consumer. You have to keep in mind that the data though coming in, the volumes of data coming into Alarm.com pretty significantly exceeds the volumes that would typically become an end to a central station for the same account. I mean, we’re basically dealing with every event and every video fragment. And if you’re trying to train an AI model, there is some merit in training it with a large volume of data because the model becomes actually more effective and more predictive. So I would think, in most cases, we’re going to be pushing some intelligence down to the central station and then hopefully providing them the tools needed to react to that intelligence and deal with it in the most coherent way with the consumer. But there may be cases where we can benefit from a model sitting in the central as well.
Jeff Kessler: Okay. Thank you. And one quick final question. With regard to the commercial business, can you talk in terms of real life practices where some of your clients are, where you would like them to be? Are there a group that are further ahead of others in taking on the commercial product? And there – is there a group that is essentially coming on and taking a little bit longer to do this? Where are you – how was that – how is in practice this coming down here in terms of time as well?
Steve Trundle: So I would say that it’s consistent with what we’ve seen with other products in terms of the adoption cycle. There are a set of early adopters that tend to be very entrepreneurial companies oftentimes run by a single owner, and so these are what we would call our carriage. Some people refer to them are carriage straight dealers or smaller dealers. They’re typically the fastest adopters of anything because they can make a decision very quickly. One person makes a decision, they move out. So we’re seeing that the most – and by the way, that’s kind of good for us because those folks tend to be very hands-on and they also tend to be fairly vociferous with their feedback. And so we’ve got a set of more than 100 early adopters, I believe, that are selling not just commercial but the commercial integrator with access solution. The feedback has been very positive and we’re looking – watching kind of the repeat sales. So not do they just sell one, or they sell one every week, they sell every two weeks, et cetera. And then, the sales cycles that takes longer and take more training more work tend to be the larger service providers that will evaluate things, will take more time to consider where they’re going. And those are all – those discussions are probably about where we thought they would be, which is we’re in discussions but it just takes some time to kind of break through inertia and drive change in a larger service provider. So most of the adoption, thus far, has been from the smaller partners we have.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon. I appreciate you letting me to ask a question. On the ARPU, I’d love to get an update, either from Steve Trundle or Steve Valenzuela, on what you’re seeing directionally in the residential piece of the business as you get more attach rates on new functionality? And is there any update on the mix that you’re seeing in the ADT channel from customers coming on board on Alarm.com versus Connect, given the benefits that it has of an on-premise system? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Sure, Gabriela. So I’ll start and Steve can help me if I need it. But with ARPU trends, we haven’t seen any significant change there. The internal dynamics are still pretty much the same, which are that we’re continuously kind of evolving the capabilities and sometimes new capabilities like commercial are – won’t yield a higher ARPU than our basic residential services. So at the same time, there’s always price pressure on the residential services. So the combination of sort of continuing to try to drive more value to our service providers and the higher-volume residential segment offset by higher ARPU coming in from either enhanced services like video or from commercial has resulted in more or less a steady-state kind of ARPU trend. And the second part of the question was regarding ADT’s plans and their transition or not. And I guess, I’d say there, probably what I’ve said in prior quarters, which is we’re aligned with ADT, working together obviously, especially on the technology side. We think they have – are taking a set of kind of exciting steps, and we don’t want to usurp the message. We think that ADT will message it’s kind of plans for what it’s going to bring to market in due time when they’re ready and we’re going to leave it to ADT.
Gabriela Borges: That’s helpful. And a follow-up, if I may, for Steve Valenzuela as well. I wanted to revisit the hardware outlook. Your comments on seasonality made a lot of sense. I also wanted to look at it maybe on a year-over-year basis. I think, guidance implies a little bit of a decline in the second half year view. It seems counter to the trajectory of pretty consistent growth if I look back a couple of years. How should we think about the trajectory of hardware business from here? And is there any reason why it would actually decline year-over-year? Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: So it’s very possible too that some of the Q2 hardware sales may have been pulled forward from Q3. So we can’t tell that for sure because given the supply shortages. So we just have to be aware of that from a guidance point of view. But typically, if you look in the past, and it is hard to tell because there are new product introductions and there are timing things occur that could skew that, but if you take that out, typically, Q4 is usually our seasonably weakest quarter for hardware. So if I was modeling this, I would probably look at Q4 to be about 10% lower sales in Q3 2018. If I was doing the model, we’ve given you the annual guidance, I think you can model it that way. So that’s – because that’s the way I would look at this. Again, hardware, we just have to be careful with when we guide because it’s not recurring. It’s not necessarily predictable. There’s so many things that occur in the past. We introduced new cameras. We introduced new commercial cameras and so that can kind of skew. We try to take that out when we give guidance and we try to think, okay, what’s the steady-state, what’s reasonable not trying to guide with all the different fluctuations that occur quarter-to- quarter. Overall, the trend, as you’ve seen, we’ve taken the guide up on hardware for the year because it is actually very hard to guide on a quarterly basis.
Gabriela Borges: I appreciate the color, thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Gearhart with First Analysis.
David Gearhart: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is just in regards to the litigation expense nice – actually not nice but a sequential increase from here. You said in your earlier remarks that it’s hard to predict with litigation expense. How should we model the year? Can you give us some sort of baseline to model for the rest of the year?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. The hardest questions, David, are questions about litigation expense because we can’t really telegraph – not in our interest or shareholders’ interest to telegraph exactly what we may be doing on the litigation side. And – but I guess what I’d say at a very high level is there’s a bit of a lull in 2017, and we think that 2018 will look a little more like 2017. When we’re all-in, we don’t think that what you saw in the second quarter is indicative, at least at the moment, of any kind of one-time blip. It’s probably more indicative of the fact that various matters are progressing at a point where there are costs that are higher as we go through sort of the ebb and flow of these matters.
David Gearhart: Okay. And then, you’ve talked about SLA agreements and having to kind of put that in your guidance and forecast that. You’ve been public for a while now. Every quarter, you’ve exceeded the high end of your SaaS and license revenue guidance. Just wondering if you can give us some sense of how often these SLA issues where it would violate an agreement occur and roughly how much you’re sizing those so we can maybe kind of get a sense for it and how that’s factoring into guidance?
Jack Vander: Well, there are a few different variables that can come into play that are sort of volatile and probably three or four different variables. And I would say, roughly, this is an approximation, but one out of every – we hope that they don’t happen at – there’s a negative outcome on negative outcome on one of these variables, you hope that not all three sort of align in the same quarter and we don’t discount to that point. But we do have to allow for the possibility that something could occur. And I would say, one out of every four quarters or so, something does occur. And that causes some unpredictability in the SaaS and license revenue stream. And our goal is to make sure that a modest fluctuation driven by one or two SLA variables doesn’t sort of lead people to lurch. So we have to – or leave them surprised. So we have to account for that. And if everything goes well, then we do outperform slightly. But anyway, that’s probably about what I – how we think about it, I guess, I would say.
David Gearhart: Okay, that’s it from me. Thank you for the color.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.
Brad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Just real quickly back on litigation. Can you remind us what the – sort of the key issues here, what the key cases that are sort of progressing and when you expect trial?
Steve Trundle: I think, most of our litigation that’s material would be in our public financials and probably the full update when the 10-Q goes up, we would refer people to that just because we’re limited in how much we can say about any current litigation on a call like this. But there are several different matters on the IP front, I think, that are reflected. There’s a little matter. There’s – I think there’s one other one that’s in the 10-Q. And we’re always dealing with sort of trolls that sometimes make it on the 10-Q, sometimes don’t. There is couple of TCPA matters, I think, one of them being bigger than the other that is approaching litigation. So I guess what I’d say is those – that’s probably about it right now. We’re on – we’ve got a body of IP matters that our legal team is handling, and then a body of – and in some cases is assertive and then a TCPA matter, and probably would just say the best situation we can provide there is going to be what we disclose in the 10-Q.
Brad Reback: Great, thanks very much.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Securities.
Matt Shea: Hi guys, Matt Shea on for Mike. First question, how much SaaS revenue did the Other category contribute? And how fast was that growth?
Steve Valenzuela: Other – this is Steve Valenzuela. The Other segment accounted for about $2.9 million of SaaS revenue in the quarter and it grew 59% year-over-year. The other thing we should note is that the Other segment as a total revenue now accounts for 7% of our total revenue, including hardware, whereas a year ago, it accounted for 6% of our revenue. So we saw 100 basis point increase in contribution from our Other segment.
Matt Shea: Okay, great. And then when might ObjectVideo officially launch a video analytics service? And will there be separate offerings for the residential versus business segments?
Steve Trundle: Sure. I’ll be disappointed if we don’t launch video analytics this year with residential segment. And I’m not sure exactly – there will eventually. Or there will be slightly different flavors for commercial. You can imagine that different commercial verticals have different analytic use cases. So I would expect that through time, there will be some more niche- oriented – commercially oriented analytics packages, but we’re focused right now on the broadly applicable base analytic package for residential customers, and we expect to have it in market this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Vander with Maxim Group.
Jack Vander: Hey guys, great quarter by the way. In response to an earlier question, you mentioned that the overall ARPU changed too much. But if I were to try to zone in on the Connect portion, revenue is up 20% year-over-year from that business. Can you split that, those drivers up between subscriber strength and ARPU just directionally?
Steve Valenzuela: We don’t really break out Connect ADT is a customer there and a few other customers, but we don’t want to get into details because ADT has their business. And they’re a public company. If we start breaking out that detail, it would be, I think, sensitive to them. So we provided the breakout of the total revenue for Connect for software license revenue of $10.2 million in the quarter. But in terms of breaking it further down, we probably shouldn’t be doing that.
Jack Vander: Okay, just a follow-up with the ADT Fidelity partnership. This – I guess, you guys said 35% share of the residential intrusion market. How large is the South American – or South African intrusion market relative to the U.S.?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. So not nearly as big as the U.S. market. On a relative basis, I would probably say, it’s probably 5% to 10% of the U.S. market in terms of TAM in that country alone. So my recollection, I have to look at my notes, my recollection is you’ve got around 12 million households and you’ve got a take rate there, you have a wider disparity of demographics and you have a take rate of residential security services of between 10% and 15% and then, of that TAM, folks taking residential security services, ADT Fidelity, which by the way, is not part of what we say ADT in the U.S., a different company. ADT Fidelity is the same brand and is a relic of when Tyco owned ADT and international ADT, but ADT Fidelity is a different sort of stand-alone independent company, and that’s roughly what I would say the TAM is that 35% there of that number.
Jack Vander: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, just real quickly, was – with the partnership there with Alarm powering ADT Fidelity’s residential offering, is the idea is that it would be like a slow uptake of Alarm’s core platform providing the back end system for that? Or is it an all-in-one kind of overnight change?
Steve Valenzuela: No. We wish it were the latter but it’s not. We haven’t figured out how to do that. So it will be a long- term partnership where we’re focused on with ADT Fidelity servicing that market, and you’ll gradually see or we will gradually see that engine crank up and begin to produce as they sell new systems and then, over a longer period of time, upgrade existing systems.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Aftahi with Roth Capital Partners.
Darren Aftahi: Yes, thanks for taking my question. On international, I think you called out 100,000. Could you characterize how fast it grew in 2Q versus 1Q? And then, on the homebuilder program, I know you called out Toll Brothers is having a sort of their own service arm. But can you talk about just the general sales cycle for trying to gauge more the national builders?
Steve Trundle: Sure. So let me start with international. I think, international, we just – what we see is slow, steady quarter-over-quarter sequential growth. Occasionally, there will be a step event if we bring on a new market and a service provider is particularly active in that market. But largely, we’re just sort of continuing to chip away at things, add markets. Frankly, fix problems at times, deal with problems. It’s not a – the path of rendering global security services is not one without some potholes, so smooth over the potholes and try to maintain our relationships and let it build over time. So I don’t remember Q-over-Q international, but I would just say that it’s – each quarter is higher volume than the prior quarter. With regard to the builders and those sales cycles, this is a new initiative for us, where we made a determination that we needed to do a better job interfacing with our partners to builders and we needed to promote the platform to builders ourselves, always with the service provider along. But these – and there’s nothing really, if you think about what we’re selling, we’re not asking the builder for a check. We’re asking them to make the most prudent decision in choosing the platform they want to put in their properties. And then the check is going to one or several of our service providers. So these are sales cycles that are sort of a cross between selling and marketing. And I would say that builders, the length of the cycle is a function of the size of builder. Again, if you got a local builder that’s building four or five homes a month, they can do very quick sales cycle. And oftentimes, our service provider handles that entirely without our involvement. If you have a national, like some of the ones you mentioned, you have to catch them at the right time and catch the right person, and that’s a six-month-plus type of sales cycle.
Darren Aftahi: Great, thank you.
Operator: Well, ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today’s presentation. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.";[0.14321040911513694, -0.011487146281489058];-0.011487146281489058;0.14321040911513694;1
54;ALRM;2018-11-08;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Alarm.com Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. David Trone. You may begin.
Dave Trone: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alarm.com’s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

The webcast of this call will be archived, and a telephone replay will also be available on our website. With these formalities out of the way, I’d now like to turn the call over to Steve Trundle. You may begin.
Steve Trundle: Thanks David. And welcome to everyone joining our call today. We are pleased to report another solid quarter that exceeded our expectations. SaaS and license revenue in the third quarter was $74.3 million, up 20% from $61.9 million in Q3 of 2017. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $25.8 million, up 32.6% over last year. During the quarter, we saw both higher-than-expected account origination and a slightly expanded breadth of services being sold and installed. These strengths drove our better-than-expected results. I want to thank our service providers as well as the Alarm.com team for their contributions during the quarter. Beyond our financial performance, I also want to highlight some of the recent progress we have made in our product portfolio. We achieved a major milestone with our release of video analytics, which was formally announced just last week. I want to give you an overview of these new capabilities and also update you on the broader development program we've established for ongoing innovation in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence. Our video analytics service is built on object tracking and object classification technology. Object tracking analyzes each frame of video to determine an object's direction of movement and duration of activity. The object classifier identifies people, vehicles and animals. Combined with virtual zones and tripwires, we can now alert subscribers about highly specific events around their property. For example, instead of sending an alert about routine movement or changes in the scene, we can now watch for people lingering near a front door for a specific duration. We can also watch for a pet getting on to a sofa or for kids leaving the backyard. For commercial applications, a business manager can confirm that a delivery truck arrived at the loading dock without being notified each time a customer exits the building. These insights can, in turn, be used to trigger devices to respond. So if we spot a person entering the backyard at night, we can turn on lights to provide an additional security deterrent. Meanwhile, if an animal such as a deer enters the same area, the user can opt not to turn on the lights but instead to turn on the sprinklers. The combination of our video analytics player with our automation capabilities demonstrates the power of a fully integrated platform. Our video analytics offering is now available for both existing subscribers and new installs with our popular 522 and 722 cameras, and we'll be expanding camera support over time. The new capabilities are packaged in a new video service plan that includes additional video content storage and is offered for a modest additional subscription fee. We believe that video analytics will generate more value and engagement for subscribers which, in turn, support sales and reduces churn for our service providers. This is the first market release of technology that has been derived from our acquisition of ObjectVideo in January 2017. Since the acquisition, we developed and deployed a deep learning architecture called a convolutional neural network. To train the system, we use real-world smart home data from video clips captured in the field. This required processing and analyzing millions of frames of video. The result is a proprietary neural network that is optimized for indoor and outdoor applications. As our subscribers adopt video analytics at scale, our neural network will continue to benefit from direct user feedback and from a continual process of training, validation and testing. Beyond video analytics, we also recently enabled Apple's new Siri shortcuts feature for our subscribers. These capabilities were part of the expanded voice assistant functionality that came with the release of iOS 12 by Apple. Subscribers can now create custom Siri phrases to trigger actions through their Alarm.com system. With our Scenes feature, they can quickly and easily engage their system to adjust multiple devices with a single voice command. This capability allows us to combine the convenience of voice control with the higher value away-from-home use enabled by mobile interfaces like the iPhone. In October, we held our annual Partner Summit here in Washington D.C. We hosted a number of our service provider partners and presented our latest products and R&D priorities. Overall, the conversations that I had during the summit reinforced that we are well aligned with our service provider partners and presented our latest products and R&D priorities. Overall, the conversations that I had during the summit reinforced that we are well aligned with our service provider partners and what they are seeing in the market. We heard additional positive feedback about the Alarm.com for business platform and we learned about new opportunities that we can address through future product enhancements. Meanwhile, in the residential market, our service providers continue to see strong demand for a professional grade fully integrated security-first smart home service. We also discussed video analytics and how this new feature set can help increase sales of video services. A number of the initial video analytics use cases are for outdoor applications where we see professional installation as a significant additional differentiator. Our service providers appreciate this alignment, and they see good opportunities for additional growth with video. Our service providers also shared positive feedback on the consumer marketing program we implemented this year. As I have mentioned before, our message informs consumers that they can turn to a licensed professional for a well-designed and reliable smart home and business system that provides long-term value. We believe these campaigns help our service providers as they market and sell our solutions. It was encouraging to hear feedback from the field validating our approach. I also want to highlight one event from our Other segment businesses this quarter. EnergyHub expanded its partnership with the Arizona Public Service, the largest electric utility in Arizona. EnergyHub's platform will manage Arizona Public Services full-scale ""bring your own device"" program which will include a broad range of grid edge devices, including battery energy storage, smart solar inverters, water heaters and connected thermostats. The expanding breadth of connected devices enables EnergyHub to provide increasing value to its utility customers with services like peak demand reduction, load shifting and renewables matching. Next, I want to spend a moment reminding investors of our high-level strategic framework as we focus on wrapping up 2018 and look into 2019. We remain committed to an adjusted EBITDA margin target range of 20% to 25% and to driving fast recurring revenue. We view hardware as a key enabler of our services, but we are not overly focused on either the amount of hardware sales or the margins of our hardware business. This gives us the flexibility to run discounted or subsidized hardware promotions that drive the adoption of a new service or an upgrade cycle with existing subscribers. To summarize, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter and the progress we've made to introduce new products, particularly our video analytics offering. Thank you again to our service provider partners and the Alarm.com team for their hard work and to our investors for their trust in our business. And with that, let me turn things over to Steve Valenzuela. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you Steve. And good afternoon everyone. I will begin with the review of our third quarter 2018 financial results and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter and our raised outlook for the full year of 2018 before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the third quarter grew 20% from the same quarter last year to $74.3 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $10.5 million for the third quarter compared to $9.3 million for Q3 2017. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 94% in the third quarter at the high end of our historical range of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenue in the third quarter was $37.6 million, up 34% from Q3 2017 revenue of $28 million. The increase in hardware revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales of our video cameras. We believe approximately 25% of video sales are for existing subscribers as they upgrade to our newer cameras or add video to their systems for the first time. Total revenue of $111.8 million for the third quarter grew 24.3% from Q3 2017. SaaS and license gross margin for the third quarter was 84.5%, consistent with our gross margin in the same quarter last year. Hardware gross margin was 18.8% for the third quarter compared to 20.5% for the same quarter last year, primarily due to mix. Total gross margin was 62.5% for the third quarter, down from 64.6% for the same quarter last year due to the hardware margins along with the higher mix of hardware revenue. Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses in the third quarter were $22.9 million compared to $19.3 million in the third quarter of 2017, as we continued our planned investment in R&D, given the significant opportunities we see in our markets. We ended the third quarter with 496 employees in R&D, up from 441 employees in the same quarter last year. Total headcount increased to 866 employees compared to 774 employees at the end of Q3 2017. Sales and marketing expenses in the third quarter were $14.1 million or 12.6% of total revenue, compared to $10.4 million, or 11.6% of revenue in the same quarter last year. Our G&A expenses in the third quarter were $43.7 million which includes a legal settlement of $28 million as we previously announced. Excluding this, our G&A expenses in the third quarter were $15.7 compared to $13 million in the year ago quarter. G&A expenses in the third quarter includes non-ordinary course litigation expense of $5.2 million and the legal settlement of $28 million compared to $1.9 million for Q3 2017. Non-ordinary course litigation expenses are part of our adjusted measures and are excluded from our measurement of our non-GAAP financial performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $25.8 million in the third quarter, up 32.6% from $19.5 million in the same quarter last year. In the third quarter due to the legal settlement, we had a GAAP net loss of $7.7 million, compared to GAAP net income of $15.1 million in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income increased to $18.2 million in the third quarter compared to $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $124.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Note, we expect to pay the legal settlement in future quarters. Therefore, ending cash balance had not been reduced for this amount as of the end of September 2018. In the third quarter, we generated approximately $19.8 million of cash flow from operations compared to $13.8 million for the third quarter of 2017. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $16.6 million, up $4.7 million from our free cash flow of $11.9 million for the same quarter last year. Through the nine months ended September 30, we generated $25.7 million of free cash flow compared to $30.9 million for the same period in 2017. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect Q4 SaaS and license revenue of $76.3 million to $76.5 million. We are increasing our expectations for full year 2018 SaaS and license revenue to be between $289.5 million to $289.7 million, up from our prior outlook for SaaS and license revenue of $286 million to $286.5 million. We are also raising our guidance for total revenue for 2018 to $407.5 million to $409.7 million, up from our prior guidance of $388 million to $390.5 million. This includes our increased guidance for hardware and other revenue of $118 million to $120 million, compared to our prior guidance of $102 million to $104 million. We expect hardware revenue for Q4 to be seasonably lower than Q3 consistent with historical trends. We are increasing our expectations for our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2018 to be between $91 million to $91.5 million, up from our prior guidance of $85.1 million to $85.9 million. We are also raising our guidance for non-GAAP net income for 2018 to $63.8 million to $64.2 million or $1.28 per diluted share, up from our prior guidance of $59.4 million to $59.9 million or $1.19 to $1.20 per diluted share. This is based on our non-GAAP tax rate of 21% as we have previously indicated. EPS is based on an estimate of 15 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year 2018 stock-based compensation expense of $13.5 million to $14 million. Finally, while it is too early to spend much time on 2019, I did want to provide a very early perspective. At this time, we are comfortable with total revenue of $430 million to $440 million for 2019, in line with current consensus. While we considerably outperformed our own expectations for sales of hardware during Q3, it can take several months for those sales to work in the channel. We anticipate that some of the behavior that led us to raise the 2018 guidance is indicative of future sales patterns. But until we're able to fully track the sale through of these incremental sales, we will remain conservative in estimating hardware revenue. Also, consistent with our past practice, our guidance does not anticipate the potential for increased revenue from new product introductions such as our recently introduced video analytics service, Alarm.com for Business and our Access Control products, among other items that we believe can drive revenue higher. We will provide our initial guidance for 2019 when we report our fourth quarter 2018 results in February next year. In conclusion, we are pleased with our performance and excited about the opportunities ahead for us and our service providers. We are continuing to invest in our business to capitalize on the expanding opportunities in both residential and commercial markets for the intelligently connected property. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And with that operator please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.
Adam Tindle: Hi, thanks. And good afternoon. Steve Trundle I just wanted to start with the question on competition. You're seeing even more significant competitive pricing on the DIY channel. Gross margin indicated down 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4 for some in that space. So I'm just hoping that you'd give a general comment on deterioration of that channel. And is there any tie-in to the EBITDA guide for Q4. I know you were expecting it to be up sequentially and mix is improving, but I recognize you just had a very, very strong Q3, so may be some conservatism built in. Thanks.
Steve Trundle: Sure Adam. I'll start with that. I'm not sure I caught all the components of the question. But in terms of the competition that we see, each quarter, we see another announcement from someone who's competing with some type of a – typically a point solution, a DIY product of some sort. As we said before, the bulk of our market are customers who view the systems that our service providers provide to be investments in their home, and they really want to have a fully serviced complete system. So we do bifurcate the markets, or we break it into components. And we have not seen any – I guess, I would say almost as evidenced by the third quarter and even the quarter before, we haven't seen a meaningful impact from any of the new competition and the more DIY point solution segment. As far as gross margins go, I would have triggered shifts in gross margin, and I made a comment on this a moment ago to be more a function of our strategy and the mix of products that we're, at any given point, attempting to get to market with our service providers. So as that mix shifts, or as we see, in some cases, sort of outperformance in one category that we didn't expect, we will see some margin compression. And I almost say that it's not our goal – and I sort of alluded to this, our goal is to get product to our service providers at a price point that works and allows them to drive services out to the customers. So we don't really attempt or we don't get too upset if we're losing some margin from time to time one quarter to another on product. That's part of our business. So I wouldn't attribute the change, though, to be driven by any sort of external market dynamic.
Adam Tindle: Okay. And I just wanted to ask an industry kind of question. Your professional monitoring channel and the high-end home automation like Control4, Cervont, et cetera, kind of two markets growing rapidly in conjunction both with seemingly sizable runways. And you've seen some overlap with both having Toll Brothers' partnerships, for example. Does it make sense, over time, for these two channels to combine, given they're both focused on empowering a Pro installer channel? Just the puts and takes to that.
Steve Trundle: Sure. Does it make sense to combine sort of a Control4 Cervont type of channel. That channel's existed for a long time and it is very much a CEA channel. It is a smaller group of customers. These are typically folks that are spending anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 on a pretty elaborate smart home system. It's driven more – the revenue model there is driven typically more by the devices and the hardware being sold, and it's less about services. So it's a different customer. Our service providers are going after a much bigger part of the market but a bit more of a value-oriented part of the market. And I think we're focused where sort of I like to be focused, which are on customers in sort of an affordable premium category, and we're not that focused on sort of the really high-end part of the market. We service some of those customers who want the best security they can have, and they may use us in concert with a Control4, with a Cervont , but it's a smaller piece of our business.
Adam Tindle: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.
Nikolay Beliov: Hey guys this is Nikolay from Bank of America. Thanks for taking my questions. Question for Steve Trundle. There seems to be a new trend in the industry with service providers, the hardware financing being down by third parties like banks. Steve Trundle, what is your kind of impression of that? Is it making the industry a little bit healthier? And kind of like how that might impact the business?
Steve Trundle: Yes good question Nikolay. So lots of different opinions on that. I'm not sure mine is any more valuable than others, but my personal opinion is that it's a healthy dynamic for the industry. Anytime you have the customer, we've always said, and all of our service providers have told us for a long time, that if a customer makes an investment in their system upfront, that those are typically better customers than customers who received the system for free and now are basically repaying for the upfront capitalization cost in the form of their monthly service bill. So we like a mix. We like to see customers that are invested up front. We think that the financing piece, if I were to spend $5,000 on my system in my own home, I could choose to finance that anyway and dealers are now increasingly making that financing more available and easier to sort of obtain for the consumer. I think that allows the service provider or the dealer to offer a wider range solution of the consumer. It's more likely to meet their complete need. I think that probably generates some downstream value to us and that the customer – if we roll the clock back 10 years, the typical customer might only have a handful of intrusion sensors in a control panel. And if you try to sell that same system today, there still is a market for it, but it's a much smaller market. The majority of the folks want to have a more powerful system that includes intrusion and includes some level of smart home functionality and cameras. So there's just a higher upfront cost, and that cost has to be borne by someone, either the service provider or the customer or potentially the customer through a financing mechanism. So I think that the financing element makes it more attainable and more possible for our service providers to sell a complete system to a customer without sort of wrecking the balance sheet by basically giving away a much bigger system today for free than what they may have needed to do 5 to 10 years ago.
Nikolay Beliov: Got it. And Steve, a question commercial. Our conversations with partners indicating really good initial traction, especially around access control. So how can you convince the channel and customers to buy not just the access controls, I guess, which sign with other third-party hardware but like more of the video plus interactive security plus access control?
Steve Trundle: Yes, good one again. So yes, we're seeing great feedback on access control. I commented on that a moment ago. I think last quarter, I indicated we had gotten an initial set of about 150 service providers set up to be early adopters. And again, promoting that product in the market, that's gone up during the third quarter, so we're continuing to see some adoption. And really in terms of getting the holistic systems sold in, first, I'd say there are some cases where access control by itself is fine or commercial by itself is fine or even video by itself, but we obviously, prefer the system, those systems where the customer has the benefit of all three technologies. And I think for us, somewhat of a missing part was really an upgrade of our video platform. So it's been acceptable, but I think this quarter, I spent a lot of time talking about what we've done with video. In prior quarters, I talked about the cameras. This quarter, I talked about really the software. And I think until the third quarter and some of the capabilities we got to market, we weren't as competitive with the video offering, especially on the commercial side as we would like to be. So not only we sort of put a stake in the ground there, and I think anyone – and we're now looking forward to building on top of that. And I think that someone obtaining that access control system today would be impressed, I should say, with the video solution that can be sold with it. So I think some of it will – some of that, what you're describing Nikolay, will happen as the product is compelling. And I think it now is in a more compelling state than we probably were three to six months ago.
Nikolay Beliov: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies.
John DiFucci: Thank you. My question – well, first of all, the results are really strong here. And I'm just trying to understand like where that's coming from. Is it coming from the core traditional alarm business? Because you guys have instituted investments in other areas like in the commercial business, in international? Are we starting to see that in these numbers? Is that what we're seeing? Or is that still yet to come? Are we seeing much of that at all in these numbers? Or are we just seeing the core business doing well right now?
Steve Trundle: Yes. I would say that the results, to the extent they're beyond our expectation, were driven more by the core business, the service providers, who are effectively selling to the consumer and Alarm.com more traditional intrusion system just because that today is a bigger part of the business, meaningfully bigger. So if that doesn't do well, other – it's hard to make up for a gap there. And when we see some outperformance there, it causes a more extreme result than normal. That's not to say the other parts aren't doing their share to contribute and aren't growing nicely, that meaning commercial, international pieces as well as EnergyHub is doing well. That's why I highlighted one of the recent deals. They're all doing well, but on a relative basis, their size is not sufficient to be the cause of a – at the current moment, and we hope this evolves. At some point in the future, each of those initiatives could outperform and drive a great result. But at the moment, none of them are at a sort of level of scale that they can nearly by themselves impact the overall quarter the way sort of third quarter came around. So third quarter was just – partners aren't selling more systems than we expected. They're putting a little bit more on those systems, particularly more video, and they had a good quarter, the service providers did for the most part. So that was the real driver there.
John DiFucci: Thanks, Steve. And if I might just one follow-up. And I don't know how much you could say about this, but it's more of a tactical question. See, you had a settlement with one of the plaintiffs from the class action suit and there's a some concern that – I mean that's just one of the plaintiffs that, that could be just the beginning of it. Is there anything you can talk to us about whether that was unique? Or I mean you never know what's going to happen, but you obviously settled that at this point. I'm just trying – we're just trying to understand the risk that you end up settling with a lot more because you can have the business doing as well as it's doing, and then as an investment, you have to weigh against some of these other things.
Steve Trundle: Right. Yes. That's a good question, John. I think if we were worried about that – I can't say a lot about that particular case obviously. I can kind of put you in a frame of mind, though, which is if we thought that were going to be a repeating phenomenon, we would be pretty reluctant to settle it. So that's the frame of mind I would probably suggest is – and then I would encourage you to basically when the 10-Q is up to give that a real careful read in the section related to legal and outstanding matters because there are no other current pending PCP matters of that nature.
Steve Valenzuela: One other pending matter was dismissed last week. You'll see that on the 10-Q that's actually filed. It's available online.
John DiFucci: Okay. Okay, great. That’s all very helpful. We’ll look – we’ll review that closely. Thanks a lot guys.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair.
Matt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up a bit on the 2019 guidance, and Steve your sort of comments about perhaps some hardware sales that might have actually occurred – might actually occur in 2019 to the end consumers being purchased from you in 2018. And so if I look at the initial 2018 guidance you gave for hardware, you're forecasted to come in about $20 million or so ahead of the high end of your initial guidance. So is that how we should – should we think about that differential as of the amount that's pull-forward from 2019 to 2018? And then, I guess, as we think about the coupling or decoupling of hardware growth relative to subscription revenue going forward, why should hardware start to materially grow slower than subscription revenue?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, this is Steve Valenzuela. So I think a couple of points there. First of all, keep in mind that Q3 and Q2 are seasonally stronger than Q4. And so when you look at the guide for hardware for Q4, just take into account seasonality. But also with Q3, we did see a very, very strong performance in video, and very encouraging to see video – about 25% of those sales going to existing subscribers. But as I said on my remarks, we just need to be cautious that if some of that was perhaps pull forward from Q4, obviously, there's a lot to of macro events occurring with potential trade wars and tariffs. So there could have been some activity or pulling some of that forward. That said, I think there is anecdotal information that we're seeing a very positive uptick in hardware. But when we look five quarters out, when we look at 2019, we're – we have to be fairly cognizant of a lot of things that can change. And as Steve said, we need to use hardware. Given that we have a very good recurring SaaS revenue and very good margin, we use hardware strategically, so we're going to maintain that flexibility. So when we look at 2019, again, this is very early. And we just wanted to be careful, given the strong performance in Q3, we didn't want folks to get ahead of themselves. But the way we were kind of thinking about 2019 with the guide, it's not the guide, but the initial look. Let me clarify that, it's not a guide. We're really thinking kind of, from our mind, hardware would look lower in 2019 than it was in 2018. Now that could actually not turn out to be the case, but we just have to be careful given that hardware's not reoccurring, given that there's a lot of macroeconomic events occurring. When we're looking at that part with an initial look, we still have to grow through our budgeting process in our cycle, we just have to be cognizant, careful when we're putting a number out there that far out in advance.
Matt Pfau: Got it. And then if I think about 2018 relative to your expectations in 2019, it sounds like a decent amount of the outperformance in 2018 was due to video camera sales. And now with video analytics functionality, that is a driver to perhaps encourage even more uptake of video which, in turn, would potentially drive more sales of your video cameras. So is that the proper way to think about that potential? Or is it the fact that maybe this video analytics is going to be integrated and used with other third-party cameras that you don't provide and, thus, there won't be a correlation from a hardware revenue perspective.
Steve Valenzuela: No. I think – I mean we just introduced video analytics which we're quite excited about. It's a very great offering focused really on a lot of SaaS capabilities. But in terms of hardware, what we said was when we talked about 2019, our practice when we give initial look to our guidance is not to include the potential upside for new product introductions. So video analytics, we just released a week ago. We really can't factor that into our initial look or guidance just yet, and – so that's kind of how we – has been our standard practice, and it's – I think it served us well so far. But I think it certainly is a great offering, very compelling and we'll see how the adoption comes through from our service providers. But the feedback both Steve said on the Partner Summit we had in October was very positive from the service providers as well.
Matt Pfau: Great, that’s helpful. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon and congrats on the quarter. This is more of a macro question for Steve Trundle, which is how sensitive do you think your business is to the housing market. Just wondering what you're hearing from the dealers on the ground in terms of new customers coming to the platform because they've moved homes or because they bought a new home for the first time versus maybe upgrading as part of their renovation budget or for some other reason. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Right. No. I think we've lived through a few housing cycles, and in the last one sort of the 2008-2009 time frame, we really weren't impacted by the negative housing cycles. So – but the business was a little less mature then. The theory and what we've learned from our service providers is that in a negative economic cycle, the desire for protecting what you have tends to go up, and folks are a little bit more focused on getting an intrusion system because they're seeing people hanging around the neighborhood. It might not be working, that sort of things. So it tends – there tends to be some positive effects, unfortunately, from a – let's say, some offsetting effects from a negative housing cycle if that is driven by negative or bad economy. I'd say we're a little bit more exposed at this point, though, than we were six or seven years ago because we have a healthy – we have a fairly healthy program now with builders, and we like to see them doing well. And then in terms of how that cycle's going to unfold, I think our view is there's still quite a bit of room for growth in the housing market. But I wouldn't say it's going to – we're not enormously volatile there, but I would say that it'd probably be more noticeable if we had a negative cycle today than it might have been for us seven, eight years ago.
Gabriela Borges: That’s very helpful, thank you. And then follow-up is on the hardware piece of the business. To the extent you can disclose, what percentage of that mix or even qualitatively is video cameras versus maybe other things like modems or thermostats? And just remind us what that – the composition of that line item looks like? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: So rough composition, and I don't have the data breakdown in front of me. But rough composition is about half of the hardware revenue component is video or video cameras. And the other half would be a mix of thermostats and module sales, which is the LTE of the modules, maybe a couple of other smaller items in the other, but primarily, thermostats and modules and then the rest would be video, 50%.
Gabriela Borges: That’s very helpful. Thank you for taking the questions.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital.
Saliq Khan: Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick questions on my end. We would see – with the launch of the video analytics, is it essentially the first step towards you guys being able to provide professional verification for the dealers? And how would you envision that playing out for the marketplace? And is it too early for us to kind of think about data analytics for monitor alarm or event verification?
Steve Trundle: Thank you for the question. So we already do, Saliq – so video verification is already a part of our value proposition and a number of our service providers make use of the video cameras already. In the current dynamic, if there is an alarm event, the service provider determines that time of installation, how that will be handled. And if the customer is comfortable with the video from the cameras coming to the central station during the event, then that is turned on. That helps the operator adjudicate the matter and make a decision on how to handle the alarm. So that's been there for some time. And in terms of video analytics impacting that, I think this would be a step – what we're doing now would a step towards a couple of things, first, potentially driving events to the central station that are not necessarily alarm events but that are still noteworthy events. We can increasingly drive intelligence from video to identify other things of interest that may be of interest to the consumer or business owner and may prompt a central station monitoring activity. We may also be able to more effectively provide the operator, the person to headline the decision, of whether or not dispatch, provide that operator with more insight into the events that they're actually trying to make a judgment on. So if we see something that is routine, we may at least want to notify the operator that everything looks routine. But for an alarm event that came off by the given intrusion sensor. So I think there will be richer data sets that we can derive with video analytics, and I think it's been in our interest and in the interest of our service providers for us to make use of those data sets as much as possible with the consumers' consent and still protective of their privacy but to make use of those data sets to improve the efficacy of the decision on whether it is to dispatch or not with the first responders.
Saliq Khan: That's very helpful, Steve. And then just a follow-up on my end, we're seeing an increased amount of conversations with the insurance providers out there, some of the utility providers and then more meaningfully for the traditional security industry, the SMB market that has traditionally been okay from a security perspective. There's a very large runway ahead for these guys. So could you highlight your plans for helping upgrade those SMB customers to more integrated and advanced analytics? And then my thought process is advanced analytics are eventually more business analytics solutions as well. How are you guys thinking about that?
Steve Trundle: Right. So we're turning our focus to that sort of in real time. I think our first goal with analytics was to get a solution out that would work for a broad range of customers, including residential and commercial, and would solve the most common use cases. But when we look at SMB in particular, there's an opportunity to drive down different verticals that have slightly different types of analytical templates and be even smarter. So for example, a store is going to look a little different than a bar and a restaurant and the types of things you're observing are going to be different, the types of accounts you're doing are going to be doing. And then the way you integrate with the point-of-sale data in that case can be different between those two different types of SMB location. So we're – I guess I should say shifting now to sort of what the next- gen opportunities are with the analytics layer. And here, I think, we're, at the moment, listening to our service providers. First and foremost, what are they seeing as the opportunity set, what's not being currently addressed at an effective level in the market and beginning to derive where we're going to go with some more specifics sort of vertically-oriented analytic templates for the SMB market.
Saliq Khan: Great. Thank you, Steve.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darren Aftahi with ROTH Capital Partners.
Darren Aftahi: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations. Just two, if I may. Just first back to analytics. So Steve, you talked about the convolutional neural network. So I'm sort of curious. When you think about long-term differentiation with video analytics and data analytics in general, like there are other solutions out there that have been trained on video images, et cetera. Like how do you differentiate the product long-term? And then embedded within that question, we use that as kind of lead gen to differentiate the product. My second question to Steve Valenzuela. I know you had talked about increasing marketing spend, and that was up pretty substantially year-on-year. I'm just kind of curious if you under spent relative to plan on 3Q. Thanks.
Steve Trundle: Sure. I'll let Steve take that second piece. It's right up his alley. And the first piece is differentiation in video analytics. I have opinions on this that I'll cover. First is there's a real scale advantage. And when you're driving a neural net and you're training that AI engine, the more, the better. The more information and content you can feed it, the smarter it becomes. So there is a scale that we think we're reasonably well positioned to take advantage of, maybe not against every competitor but against the majority of the folks. The second is we're focused and always have been on trying to take cutting-edge capabilities and make them fit an economic envelope that still works for the average sort of affordable premium type of customer. And in this case, if we look at our acquisition of ObjectVideo, a lot of what we rolled out are capabilities that they've done a decade ago almost, got it a little differently. But the real challenge was figuring out how to make that technology work without a ton of compute on the edge and with a modest amount of sort of supplemental commute – compute in the crowd such that we can price it at a level that is affordable for the average even residential consumer. So that's a place for today I think as of right now, we have an advantage, and we will stay focused on maintaining that advantage. Of course, the cost of compute on the edge will steadily come down, but that's the focus. The third is more interesting – a lot more interesting but a more – a different sort of level differentiation, which I think is going to come from the business model of the companies who are involved in providing the capability. And what I mean by this is our business model allows us to be very transparent with the customer on how we treat their information and how we protect their privacy. We don't need to take metadata from a video analytics layer and push that in to our marketing database or any other database that we may maintain on the consumer. I think some of the other folks that are potentially in the market can't make that same commitment to the consumer and still have a viable business model. So I think that can actually be – the third part is trust. And you operate long enough and you do well by the consumer and hope that their trust in our approach would become a third-level differentiation. I'll leave the second piece for Steve.
Steve Valenzuela: Hey Darren, the question on the marketing. So the marketing spend for Q3 was actually about 12.6%. At the beginning of the year, we did say we expected marketing to be around 14% to 15% of revenue. And so we're pretty much right on track. Another thing to think about, too, is Q4, we do have in October our annual dealer – national service provider conference in Washington D.C., which does increase the marketing spend a bit in the fourth quarter. But I would say from a planned point of view, we're right on track with the marketing spend, as we laid out at the beginning of the year.
Darren Aftahi: Helpful. Thanks.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, Darren.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Gearhart with First Analysis.
David Gearhart: Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. First question I wanted to ask, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the video analytics offering would be a modest increase in pricing. Just wondering if you can give us some sense of how much of an uplift it would be on a per-subscriber basis, on the analytics piece itself and on the storage side.
Steve Trundle: On the analytics piece and on the storage, okay. Well, that's two parts actually. They're very related, which is we have wanted to introduce this in a way that we think it is conceivable for our service providers to offer it at a modest additional sort of rate to the consumer. And what we've included – our typical today basic video plan is – includes 30 – roughly 30 clips of storage per day on up to four cameras. That's our plan today, and that does not include video analytics. And we're not getting rid of that plan. So we're not going to sort of drop out of that market. That's probably the most sort of price competitive part of the market. We want to keep our entry-level offering available there. With this offering, we're including 100 clips per day for each property on up to four cameras in aggregate. So we're tripling the storage that comes with the plan that includes video analytics, and then we're including the analytic capabilities that we've currently released. And the incremental cost, there's sort of what's the consumer is going to pay and what do we expect. I think our expectation, I don't want to get into a ton of detail because I want to leave our service providers a lot of freedom to place how it makes sense for them. But our expectation is that the incremental revenue to us from one of these would be roughly an extra $1, $1.5 per month.
David Gearhart: Okay, that’s helpful. And then just wondering if you can give us a quick update on international and what you're seeing there in terms of traction and trajectory.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. International is – I think I spent a little bit of time on that last quarter, and at that time, I think we said we were up to sort of in the 37 different countries with service providers. And kind of moving along, I don't think much changed. The momentum on international is about the same. Let me see if I have anything – growth is healthy, but still sort of early days. In the third quarter, I think we're getting to the point where more of our partners internationally where we're sort of shifting from testing, pilots and early sort of efforts to sort of getting to the point where folks are really beginning to institutionalize what we do into their offering. I expect that will continue to drive uptake on international. Particularly, there are some markets that are a little more mature. But particularly when I look at Europe as an example, I think we're kind of on the cusp from a shift that will be positive. The big thing was the announcement with the insurance company, though, with Aviva last quarter and just generally seeing positive trends there, but haven't focused on it as much this quarter.
David Gearhart: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, thank you. You mentioned that the lower hardware GM was due to mix. Presumably, that's due to video cameras, correct? And therefore, has that been driving ARPUs higher and that's a big part of the strong SaaS growth that you've been reporting?
Steve Valenzuela: So part of the margin impact in the quarter was increase in modules as well, which does have an impact on margin. So there were more module sales in the quarter. But then also, as we talked about, there were more sales of video, and there's a mix of different video cameras as well with different margins as well. But you're right, generally, with the video service, generally, there is an uptick in SaaS. I just want to be cautious in terms of how that plays out exactly, but…
Nehal Chokshi: Okay.
Steve Trundle: No, that’s fine if that would make it work. But Steve's key point is there were quite a few module sales as well in the third quarter and those are sold normally through an OEM channel where we sell to another manufacturer who then resells to the service provider. So those are typically at pretty thin margins.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, understood. So just to be clear then, that percent of hardware sales that's going to video is increasing on a year-over-year and Q-over-Q basis. Is that correct?
Steve Valenzuela: That’s correct. Yes.
Nehal Chokshi: Excellent. Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes.
Nehal Chokshi: Go ahead.
Steve Valenzuela: No, I think that's correct. I would say any given month there can be variability. It depends on where the orders come in. But on a trend line basis, that is true.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.

Steve Trundle: Thank you, David. Good afternoon and welcome to everyone. We are pleased to report that fourth quarter results were above our expectations. Our SaaS and license revenue in the fourth quarter was $77.8 million, up 19% over last year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $20.9 million. Our fourth quarter results helped close out a strong 2018. Throughout the year, our service providers continued to be very effective with our technology in their markets. We owe much of our success to that performance. We saw nice growth in our core residential and commercial security business, and in other markets as reported by our other segment businesses. We believe that our progress in 2018 successfully extended our leadership in the connected property space. Today, more than 8,000 service providers service our technology in more than 6.1 million properties globally, and more than 90 million connected devices and sensors are enabled in the solutions provided by our cloud services. With our growing scale in the connected property space, we plan to continue to accelerate our pace of innovation, strengthen our service providers advantages in the marketplace, and increase our participation in the Internet of Things secular trend. Before I go further, I want to thank our service provider partners, our ecosystem partners and our employees, who all contributed to our progress in 2018. On today's call, I want to spend more time on several key elements of our 2019 strategy. Those elements include driving growth through innovation in our core channels, increasing the differentiation and adoption of our video services, developing international markets, and building our vertical businesses. Product innovation is the cornerstone of Alarm.com strategy. Last year, we launched a number of new products and expanded the Alarm.com platform to enable our service providers to attack additional market opportunities. In April, we lunched Alarm.com for Business. This new service is engineered for the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. It offers commercial grade security, video surveillance, intelligent automation, sophisticated user management, multi-location awareness, and intelligent operational reporting. Importantly, it's all delivered through a single integrated solution. We see a good opportunity for our service providers to upgrade small and medium-sized businesses from traditional, locally managed systems to our always-on connected solution. As part of our Alarm.com for Business initiative, we also recently launched Smarter Access Control. This commercial grade solution securely manages access to facilities and fully integrates with our entire spectrum of commercial services. We complemented the release of this offering with a series of new commercial grade cameras that expand the applications for our video services. Successfully driving adoption of a significant new service line like Alarm.com for Business through a channel, requires a concerted sales, marketing and support efforts. In 2019, we plan to work to engage our partners on multiple levels in order to drive further adoption of our commercial services in the market. To support this goal, we recently expanded our partner education program. This training gives our service providers access to the required technical skills for installing and implementing our commercial solutions, and establishes a consistent training standard for our service providers. During the year, more than 900 service provider businesses participated in our commercial training program, and more than 1,500 technicians completed and passed the required training for deploying our Smarter Access Control solution. We plan to continue to work hard to develop our service provider base in this area in 2019. We also enhanced the direct hands-on support we provide to technicians and installers. With the launch of Alarm.com for Business, we saw an expected increase in overall support volume last year. At the same time, our customer satisfaction and quality assurance metrics exceeded our internal benchmark goals. Providing reliable, trustworthy service to our partners is a core tenet of our strategy. Over the long-term, it helps our service providers become more efficient with our technology and helps us retain our valued partners. As we roll into 2019, we will also be focused on the success of ADT’s new command-and-control smart home system. We worked in close partnership with ADT to develop this new offering. ADT recently launched the deployment of this new offering, and early indications are positive. As ADT transitions to this new system, we will also continue to support and improve the existing connect platform that supports the ADT Pulse offering, which is used by more than 2 million subscribers. Also key to our 2019 strategy is the expansion of our artificial intelligence platform to drive differentiation and adoption of our video services. In October, we launched our video analytics offering. This launch was a result of a multiyear effort to extend our leadership into the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Our new AI architecture enables video cameras to distinguish between people, vehicles, and animals. It can also track an object’s direction of movement and duration of activity. We offer these advanced analytics capabilities as part of an accessible and various cost effective video solution. With our video analytics platform now deployed at scale, we plan to expand the analytics capability to our full range of cameras and continue to train the system to address additional high-value use cases, particularly for SMB applications. Furthering the development of our international business is also a key element of our 2019 strategy. As I mentioned on our call last quarter, we feel that we have the right base of ecosystem hardware partners and carriers in place to enable international service providers to deploy our solutions at scale. In early 2018, we reached a milestone of 100,000 active international subscriber accounts, and our international team continued to add new markets and partners throughout the year. I am very happy with the global service provider relationships we have been fortunate to cultivate. And in 2019, we plan to focus on building out our global team and making sure that we can do an outstanding job in supporting these partners. Europe is one of the stronger international markets and one where we continue to make good progress. In August, we announced a partnership with Aviva, a leading global insurance company. They are launching a smart home security and energy management offering to their customers in Ireland. Our partnership with Securitas also remains strong. They are now offering smart security services in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Sweden. And Securitas Iceland is also successfully deploying our solution. We also see continued momentum in Turkey, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as in Latin America where we added key strategic partners in the second half of 2018. Claro Americas is a large telco in the region and we partnered with one of their subsidiaries, called NET. NET is one of the largest cable television providers in Latin America, and they are piloting a video based solution in Brazil. GTD, another large telco in Latin America will launch our services in Chile. And G4S, a well-respected global security company, has launched our services in Colombia and Guatemala. We have more work to do to together to make these promising partnerships successful in 2019, and beyond, but these early relationships give us additional confidence in the global opportunity for our business. Our vertical businesses are another key element of our 2019 strategy. We report these businesses in our other segment, and they include PointCentral, EnergyHub and Building 36. PointCentral offers an enterprise level smart home automation service for property managers of both short-term and long-term single-family and multifamily rental properties. The PointCentral market includes vacation rental properties, residential REITs, and other businesses requiring an unattended access and delivery solution. PointCentral has developed particular momentum in the residential REIT space. For example, in 2018, they a partnership to deploy solutions to invitation homes portfolio of 80,000 properties. In 2019, PointCentral will focus on executing rollouts to many of these properties already under an agreement, while continuing to build their pipeline of new enterprise customers. EnergyHub offers an enterprise software solution that manages distributed energy resources for utilities. Through its cloud platform, EnergyHub intelligently orchestrates a range of IoT devices to provide a rich set of grid management services. In 2018, EnergyHub announced new and expanded programs with leading utilities, including National Grid, Lincoln Electric System, Salt River Project, Seminole Electric Cooperative and Sawnee EMC. They also recently announced an expanded partnership with Arizona Public Service. EnergyHub's platform will manage grid-edge devices that include battery energy storage, smart solar inverters, water heaters and connected thermostats, and provide APS with critical bridge services, such as load shifting, renewables matching, voltage support, and peak demand reduction. Meanwhile, Building 36 continues to make strides developing the HVAC channel and building their product offering. They also play a key engineering role in our energy management technology and were instrumental in developing our HVAC safeguards capabilities. This machine learning capability monitors HVAC system and can alert service providers and homeowners to trouble conditions before they escalate into more expensive damage or complete system failures. Although each of these vertical businesses are in different stages, I'm pleased with their collective overall progress. With skilled teams in each business, we’ll continue to invest to develop these opportunities through 2019, and report further on their progress as the year unfolds. To summarize, I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter and throughout 2018. We also have a strong plan for 2019 that I am excited about leading. Thank you again to our service provider partners and the Alarm.com team for their hard work and to our investors for their trust in our business. And with that, let me turn things over to Steve Valenzuela. Steve?
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with the review of our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results, and then provide guidance for 2019 before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the fourth quarter grew 19% from the same quarter last year to $77.8 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $10.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to $9.6 million for Q4 2017. For the full-year of 2018, SaaS and license revenue grew 23% from 2017 to $291.1 million. I should note that 2017 represents a partial year for Connect software license revenue from the closing of our acquisition of the Connect’s business unit of Icontrol on March 8, 2017. Our SaaS and license revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 93% in the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our historical range of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenue in the fourth quarter was $33.6 million, up 42% over Q4 2017. The increase in hardware revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales of our video cameras. We continue to see strong sales of our video cameras with about one in four installs going to our existing installed base of subscribers, and the remainder going to new subscribers. Total revenue of 111.4 million for the fourth quarter grew 25% from Q4 of 2017. For all of 2018, total revenue grew 24% to $420.5 million. SaaS and license gross margin for the fourth quarter was 85.1%, down slightly from Q4 of 2017 gross margin of 85.5%. Hardware gross margin was 18.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 21.9% for the same quarter last year, primarily due to product mix. Total gross margin was 65.1% for the fourth quarter compared to 68.6% for the same quarter last year, mainly due to the lower hardware margins. Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses in the fourth quarter were $24.4 million compared to $18.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as we continued scaling our planned investments in R&D to support the opportunities we see in our markets. We ended the fourth quarter with 500 employees in R&D, up from 447 employees in the same quarter last year. Total headcount increased to 884 employees compared to 784 employees at the end of Q4 2017. Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter were $16.3 million or 14.7% of total revenue compared to $10.9 million or 12.2% of revenue in the same quarter last year. Marketing expenses will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, based on planned marketing events and as we make decisions that affect the timing of various marketing campaigns. Our G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $17.8 million compared to $13.6 million in the year ago quarter. G&A expense in the fourth quarter includes a $3.3 million impairment provision on a promissory note we provided to one of our suppliers, who is implementing a financial restructuring. This $3.3 million charge is recorded as an expense against both our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. G&A expense in the fourth quarter includes non-ordinary course litigation expense of $3.2 million compared to $2.3 million for Q4 2017. Non-ordinary course litigation expenses are part of our adjusted measures and are excluded from our measurement of our non-GAAP financial performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $20.9 million, which includes the previously mentioned $3.3 million impairment charge of the note to our supplier. For 2018, adjusted EBITDA was $93.1 million, up 30% from 2017. In the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $7.9 million compared to GAAP net income of $320,000 in Q4 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted net income increased to $14.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for 2018 was $66.1 million or $1.33 per diluted share, up 47% from non-GAAP net income of $45.1 million or $0.92 per share for 2017. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $146.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. Note, in Q1 2019, we paid $5 million of the TCPA legal settlement and expect to pay the remaining $23 million later this year. In the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $25.7 million in cash flow from operations, compared to $18.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $24 million, up from $15.8 million free cash flow for the same quarter last year. Through the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, we generated $49.7 million of free cash flow compared to $46.7 million for the same period in 2017. Turning to our financial outlook. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect SaaS and license revenue of $78.5 million to $78.8 million. For the full-year of 2019, we expect SaaS and license revenue to be between $328 million to $332 million. We are projecting total revenue for 2019 of $440 million to $450 million, which includes estimated hardware and other revenue of $112 million to $118 million. We estimate that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for 2019 will be between $101 million to $103 million. Non-GAAP net income for 2018 is projected to be $69 million to $71 million or $1.37 to $1.41 per diluted share. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 21% for 2019. EPS is based on an estimate of 50.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year 2019, stock-based compensation expense of $17 million to 50.418 million. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2018. We are focused on executing on our business strategy and investing in our growth opportunities, while continuing to deliver solid financial results. Thank you for joining us on our call today. And with that operator, please open the call for Q&A.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Nikolay Beliov: My first question is for Steve Trundle. Steve, can you talk about the product and technological differences between ADT Pulse and ADT Command, and what’s the likelihood that ADT might become keen on moving the Pulse subscribers to ADT Command?
Steve Trundle: The ADT team designed a new -- entirely new application, which is being called Control. The architecture is more of a SaaS architecture than an on-premises architecture. There are a number of new feature sets. They established a new hardware platform for the offering as well. And, I’ve got to be careful and that it's in their offering and I want to let them talk about it. But, it's just -- it's a significant upgrade over what they have been offering. And that's not to say that with Pulse we want -- continue to make a number of upgrades and continue to enhance that platform as well.
Nikolay Beliov: Then, a question for Steve Valenzuela. Steve, when you look at the subscription revenue guidance for 2019, and at high level, what is underlying assumptions you have embedded into the guide. It looks a little bit lighter than we expect that?
Steve Valenzuela: So, consistent with our past practice, when we're giving a guidance range, we’re considering what we have, what we know today. And so, we don't factor in additional upside or we don't factor in a lot of the growth initiatives that we know are out there that are still early stages. So, we’ve just consistently provided guidance based on that methodology. We think that's worked well for us and we've really stuck with that.
Operator: Our question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Adam Tindle: I just wanted to start about Steve Trundle, you've talked about being very thoughtful about the investments that the Company makes. In the past, you’ve talked about every dollar of marketing typically brings about dollar or more of incremental SaaS revenue. But I know you have a number of initiatives and vertical market expansion that you outlined. So, I'm just hoping that you can touch on how do the payback rules of thumb change because kind of to the point of last question, it seems like a step function decline in payback and SaaS growth rate based on 2019 guidance versus what you would expect to pay back, it's still less than 1. I acknowledge that you outperformed initially in 2018, but hoping you can touch on those dynamics?
Steve Trundle: Sure, yes. First, keep in mind that ‘18 had a partial benefit from the Icontrol acquisition. But looking at those other segments, the payback is just a lot longer and then more material. So, there's certain investments we can make where we’re looking inside of the year and we can see sort of instantaneous results -- not instantaneous, but you can see certain customer creation activity result from certain sales activity. And then, with the other segment businesses, these are more R&D investments at some levels, where as our experience with the Alarm.com is an indicator, we're looking out over a 10-year horizon and thinking about where we want to be in half a decade and then a decade, and which markets we want to be in. So, it's much harder to sort of do an NPV calculation on the investments we’re making there. But, we think that the upside merits, more speculative investment and likewise. We think that the strength of the Company has enhanced with adding sort of increasing breadth of markets that we’re able to serve and enable. So that's sort of how we look at. I think we're probably a little less focused on spreadsheet mechanics when we think about our other segment businesses and sort of the long-term goals that we have there.
Steve Valenzuela: I would say that the other segment is growing faster than overall Alarm.com. And If you look at in 2018, the other segment, which includes EnergyHub, PointCentral and Building 36, contributed 8% of total revenue, that's up a 100 basis points from 2017, when they contributed 7% of total revenue. So, while they’re still early stage, they are contributing more revenue and becoming more significant to overall Alarm.com total revenue.
Adam Tindle: Maybe just a quick follow-up. I wanted to touch on kind of more near-term differentiated results. We've seen significant weakness from the publicly traded DIY players, like in the security camera market, even the pro-install players at the high-end and the CEDIA channel have experiences slowness. So, I'm just hoping that you can maybe reflect on the different channels around you, and how you’ve been able to navigate with strong double-digit growth while they’ve seen turbulence?
Steve Trundle: Yes. It's a good question, Adam. We are not in those markets that much. So, we don't see sort of a day-to-day pressures in activities that exist there. We have noted some of the results that have come in. I think, what we've been sort of stating fairly consistently is it really isn’t all one market. There is a market that prefers what we characterize as real security, robust security where the homeowner views the implementation of the smart home system and particularly the smart security system to be an investment in their property. And therefore, it's important for them to have a trusted relationship with a special service provider, and that market has been robust. And so, I think we've been probably less exposed to some of the volatility. If you think about the DIY markets, they tend to be affected by where you are in the early adopter versus mainstream sort of adoption curve. And you never really know where you are on that curve at any given point in time. So, it's easy to extrapolate that you are already in the mainstream and you are sort of kicking along at a certain rate and then you really realize you're sort of at the tail end of an early adopter stage and you've got, you don't -- it's much harder to predict those businesses I think. So, fortunately, our business is proven and it's been around for a while and we have a lot of confidence in our service providers. If I think about the high end, I think probably the reason we've -- maybe not seeing some of the same indications there as what we've heard there are first where slightly we’re less exposed to new construction starts and second, I think that the buyer is still -- at least our buyer, our buyer is a security first customer. And people always have a need for security and safety and through thick and thin. So, I think, again, we've been able to maybe not see as much volatility there as some of the others.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Julian Serafini: Hi. This is Julian Serafini on for John. So, I guess, I just want to touch back on the guidance again. I know, you've touched on earlier, and Steve, you talked about not factoring in all the upside necessarily. I guess, I just want to confirm that, the core business is still going strong and going well, because even if you factor in some upside, there is still a bit of decel from 2017, 2018. So, I just want to confirm that, things are going well in the core business at least?
Steve Trundle: Yes. We’re still very busy. I think, we've seen sort of mid-teens growth coming. We provided initial outlook last year. And actually, I think on the total side, we’ve raised that number with this outlook. So, business is still doing well, we’re growing nicely on a percentage basis, we’re not growing it quite the way we were when we were a smaller company but we’re still improving the outlook about the growth we see and the outlook for the year and then about a lot of the upside you are seeing, some of the emerging opportunities. So, generally, our billings are pretty positive right now.
Julian Serafini: And then, just the second question is on the video product. I think, you talked about, driving some of the video products and video analytics going forward this year. Are you going to do anything in terms of like incentivizing subscribers, maybe discounts in the video hardware or something to like incentivize, you want to upgrade to video products?
Steve Trundle: That’s a really -- that's a good question. And I’m chuckling because it's question that reflects a conversation we've been having in the last week, which is exactly what is the upgrade cycle on video cameras and what if a customer has video cameras that are 3, 4 years old, is there a sufficient sort of gain and the capability that we really should do more to drive adoption. We're already seeing, Steve V said moment ago where he’s seeing one out of four of the new cameras going into existing customer account. So, my belief is the functionality is still materially -- so much better with the new cameras and with the analytics capability that we probably don’t have a need to do just for the purpose of video to do any sort of inducement to purchase. But, I think that there may be reasons to package up the new video analytics capability with something like an LTE upgrade offer and use it to generate pull-through for some other types of goals we may have in the Company.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Hey. You spoke a little bit about the commercial initiatives. I wonder if you could give us just an update on that, any thoughts as you kind of roll that out, maybe more so in ‘19. And specifically, as you think about the dealer network, is it an expanded dealer network given it's a bit of a different skillset from an installation perspective, or do you still focus on the core dealers in the residential that offer both type of services?
Steve Trundle: It's both actually. So, the existing base of service providers, quite a few of them have serviced commercial in one frame or another, in one way or another historically, and some have not. But in any case, all of them have one thing in common, which is hopefully they have a trusted relationship with Alarm.com, and they therefore will be open to levering our capabilities on the commercial side or developing a commercial business around our capabilities, so that's what I'd say about the existing partners. There are a set of players in the industry that are purely commercial that really aren't residential, and now, we have a reason to have a dialogue with those parties, so we anticipate some expansion of the partner base. I think we even saw that a bit toward the end of last year where we're in discussions and going through the process with service providers that focus really on the SMB segment where we've designed this offering to focus. And it's still fairly early, but we did see meaningful uptake last year of the commercial service plans and made a lot of progress I think also in getting the access control component of that commercial plan embedded in the market.
Kevin McVeigh: And then, should the traditional relationship between the SaaS and the hardware lines across the revenue stay constant as you get more commercial, or should we expect that to flex up or down a little bit?
Steve Trundle: That one's a bit of a hard one for us to predict because it's a little bit partner-dependent or ecosystem-dependent, and at various points, we will engage with the other parties that are in the ecosystem in different ways. Sometimes we'll make a product; sometimes we'll introduce a new partner. So, the long-term trend there is challenging for us to really predict. What I will say is in the near-term, obviously, with the commercial plans, we're creating more value. There's a wider range of services, and therefore, the arc through there is a bit higher. At the same time, those customers tend to not be satisfied with one camera but instead need several, and there's a more meaningful hardware component as well as they build out a full solution. So, I don't know that I have an exact prediction for you, but I would probably say something in line with historical numbers is probably the right place to be right now.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. And then just one last one if I could. With ADT's partnership with Amazon, have you started to see any impact on that in terms of flow-through to your business from ADT, or are we still too early in that process?
Steve Trundle: We're still too early in that process.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Matt Pfau: I wanted to get a little bit more detail on the video analytics product. And so, in terms of initial uptake of video analytics, has that primarily been from new customers or have you seen uptake from existing customers? And then [inaudible], I believe that's only available on two of the cameras that you deploy, so as you make that more broadly available, maybe you could give us an idea in terms of maybe percentage of your base of video customers that would potentially be able to adopt the product as you implement it into more video cameras?
Steve Trundle: I'd say we've seen the adoption on both existing subscribers who have video cameras that have the processing power required to support our analytics offering. There were a number of folks that were waiting. And then we're definitely seeing the adoption on new installations because they're using a mix of cameras that are more likely to support the capabilities. You're absolutely correct though that at the moment in the camera portfolio, there are a handful of our cameras, especially the POE cameras that are not yet generally available in a way that supports analytics capabilities. So, I think as the full portfolio supports the video analytics' ability, we'll continue to see a rise in the adoption rate there, but it's already at a rate that I can almost envision over the next few years that some base level of functionality will become standard table fare that's sold into every installation.
Matt Pfau: And then, have you been working with your partners to educate them more on the offering and get them to push it through to customers, or is there more of an opportunity there from a marketing perspective with your dealers?
Steve Trundle: I definitely think there's more of an opportunity there to educate the service providers and also the consumer, and there is always a bit of a lag. People hear about it, but until they have actually done a few installations, watch what happens to their customer service intensity, get comfortable that the customers are happy, it just takes a while. It takes a while for us to train, and we're still in a pretty early part of that cycle, so we definitely have an opportunity to do more there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Steve Trundle, I wanted to follow up on some of the earlier comments. I understand that you're limited on what you can say about ADT, so I'll focus instead on the implications for your business model. How should we think about the RPU and gross margin on some of the new SaaS-like architecture product versus the classic SaaS business? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Gabriela, you're comparing our tradition SaaS business to which product?
Gabriela Borges: The new ADT interact -- the new ADT SaaS-like stack.
Steve Trundle: Oh, I see. I see, okay. The new model is more like our traditional Alarm.com model in that we're trying to deliver a fuller range of services that include all the operations of hosting the offering or redundantly hosting the offering, managing a set of carrier and communication relationships, and doing as much as we can to provide the maximum amount of efficiency and leverage from our abilities as we can. So, it's more like the traditional Alarm.com business model.
Gabriela Borges: That's very helpful. Thank you. And the follow-up is a high-level question on the earlier comment on early adopters versus maybe interactive technology becoming a little more mainstream. So, maybe for Steve Trundle, I would love to get your thoughts, where do you think we are in terms of adoption on the transition from classic, traditional security to something more interactive like what Alarm.com offers? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: I was almost speaking about the adoption curve. Someone had asked me about the DIY products and trying to know where you are, why are we seeing the turbulence there, and I was sort of speculating that we just don't know where they are on the curve. In our case, I think we do know a little bit more about where we are on the curve just because we've been at it for a decade, and I think we're into the mainstream and have been into the mainstream for the last couple of years and are gradually executing the process of moving, hopefully, the entire market from one that was dominated by a POTS-based not-always-connected solution to one that is always connected. I guess rough math would be that there're somewhere between 20 million and 25 million of those historic customers, and we're probably 8 million or 9 million into that base at this point with interactive capabilities, and then of course we're working to increase the size of that market as well. So, it all depends on how you define the market, but I think in the space that we serve, which is really the professionally serviced customer on the residential side, we're in sort of the mainstream component of the curve. On commercial, we're probably still in the early adopter part of the curve at the moment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you and thank you for taking my call. First question would be on the introduction of Smart Signal and what you're going to do with it. Can you give us some type of timeline with regard to, number one, how are you going to train and get Smart Signal out into the marketplace because it seems like Smart Signal is the first part of a maybe ASAP to PSAP type of jump start, but it's also obviously a lot more of a personal item to be able to actually make things convenient for the end use. So, the first question is around Smart Signal and what you're going to do to get greater adoption and how you're going do it.
Steve Trundle: Good question, Jeff. So, we're excited with the award we were able to get on that capability at CES. The whole goal here is to give the user control and at the same time, in this case, to really cut back on the false dispatches and false alarms that central stations, unfortunately, and first responders have to deal with. So, with Smart Signal, we're giving the customer a lot of control in terms of their ability to cancel out alarms and do that from their mobile app and the process there. And then of course the second thing is also very important, which is we're giving the customer the ability to initiate a panic from their mobile device and route that into both the control panel and into the central station, and ultimately, to the PSAP. So, in both cases, the way it works is the app, the functionality is actually built into the platform and it's now available essentially to any subscriber with one caveat. Their service provider and then the underlying central station has to be comfortable with the functionality and be ready to turn it on because the way the signals come in, there are new types of signals that they may not have previously needed to deal with. There are new types of response regimens that they need to train their operators on. So, what we're seeing is everyone's enthusiastic about it. The initial service providers that have deployed are confirming that we're seeing a reduction in the number of signals hitting the central that require the operator to make calls, and we're also seeing a reduction in the number of false dispatches, but each central and each service provider will have to go through our training program and really test the functionality, then train their folks on how to handle these signals so that there's no deviation from protocol. So, that's what we're doing right now. Longer term, you're correct, it's part of an overall goal we have to make more efficient the way that with the wealth of information, the wealth of content that we have about a location and about what typically happens at that location, to provide better content and better information to the first responder so that everyone in the entire value chain is able to work most efficiently, so it's part of that cycle.
Jeff Kessler: As a follow-up to that, as you know in December, a federal court upheld an ordinance from a small community in Georgia against the local alarm companies. And while it is a good, probably deserved, kick in the butt for some of these alarm companies who have been cruising on this for a while, it brings up, I would say, the need for an accelerated verification capability on the part of the leading companies in the industry who want to avoid the problems of these ordinances. And the question to you is beyond Smart Signal, what are you doing or what can you do to essentially become more of a verifier and obviously increase the value proposition for Alarm.com? I mean, I'm seeing beyond the integrated companies, it is also some of the independent monitoring companies that are monitoring the DIY guys are beginning to incorporate some of your stuff along with some other people's verification stuff because they realize that this is not something that is going to be for four or five years from now. This is something they've got to do in the next year or two.
Steve Trundle: So, two thoughts on that. I think that's a good point. I think that's probably a constructive trend for us in that folks do want to make sure that what they're passing to the first responders is a valid alarm signal, so what can we do about it and how does that help Alarm.com? First, for a long time, we've used machine-learning to differentiate between routine activity and unexpected activity, so we're at a point where you can imagine with the data we have on a property, and if you take the algorithms we're using, for example, in healthcare, we can predict the likelihood that a signal is false or real and provide one more data point there. The second relates directly to the video analytics that I've already spoken to which we can tell a lot about what's actually happening on a property, give people a first view of that, and I think we'll see our service providers move to increasingly lay on verification layers to increase the value of what they're providing to the first responders.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you. One final question. What can you do to integrate and become part of the ecosystem of some of those companies that have been involved in both access control and video for mid-size and larger commercial companies but are trying to come down into the marketplace now? And come down meaning into the smaller commercial area. It could be competition for you, but they could also be partners with you as well. I mean, the names are well known in the security industry, and it seems to me that you have the opportunity here to not just integrate with smaller camera folks and smaller access-control folks but with people who have some larger systems out there to get your applications into a just slightly higher level of the small business and commercial area.
Steve Trundle: Good question, again. So, definitely, we're starting with a SMB focus. I think you have to focus and you have to train in one area. That said, the platform is not limited by the square footage of the facility in any certain way, and we're seeing a few installs that are 100 access point plus that demonstrate an ability of the platform to scale up, but if we think about our base of service providers, we think that initially, the sweet spot for them is in the SMB, and then we'll move from hopefully what we will build as a position of strength, we'll begin to move up market after that.
Jeff Kessler: And I'm sorry, one last question and I will make it quick. You've got four or five businesses in the other category, you've gone from 7% of your total revenues to 8% of your total revenues. Can you talk about which of those businesses are actually seeing the greatest traction right now?
Steve Trundle: At the moment, the greatest traction is from EnergyHub and PointCentral.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Gearhart with First Analysis. Your line is now open.
David Gearhart: So, my first question has to do with the homebuilder channel. You recently announced the relationship with DR Horton, and earlier in 2018 in June, you announced a revised program and you had a relationship already with a large builder, I believe Toll Brothers. Just wondering if you could talk about adoption since that revised homebuilder program in 2018 and how we should think about attach rates for recurring service on new builds. Is there a percentage that you're seeing that we could use as a proxy to kind of handicap DR Home -- DR Horton builds and try to get a sense of how that could shape?
Steve Trundle: I'd say that roughly, so assuming you have a relationship with the homebuilder and you have the opportunity to speak to the customer, that the range of the take rate or the acceptance rate is between 40% and 50% is what you're generally seeking to obtain there. And it may be you have a higher percentage that are using more of an automation-only type of offering, but when we get to security, that's the take rate that we'd like to be seeing as a minimum.
David Gearhart: And then in terms of ADT, you're supporting their new platform and their prior platform. The company recently announced earlier this month that it actually acquired a do-it-yourself solution, so I just wondered if you could provide some color, how you're thinking about DIY in terms of their having a solution? Is it something that Alarm.com can support, or is it just something that's too early to kind of discuss in terms of where you could fit in with that offering with ADT?
Steve Trundle: Yes. I guess, what I'd say, David, is it's probably a little early for us to discuss much there. I think we've seen for a long time, if I roll the clock back a year or two, there was a DIY partnership there with Samsung. I think it's not really a new dynamic that ADT is growing their business in a number of different dimensions. Our role today has been more on the professional services side, so we haven't really focused much on the DIY component. It's probably a little early for me to comment any further on that one.
David Gearhart: And then lastly, litigation obviously picked up in '18 versus '17. How should we think about the direction of litigation expenses in '19? Should it be flat, up, down? Just for modeling purposes. Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Hey, David. It's Steve Valenzuela. I would look at it at about the same level as 2018, not including the $28 million TCPA settlement. So, if you take that out of litigation, litigation expense was around $17.5 million or so in 2018 compared to about $7 million in 2017. So, I would model right around the same level. And I have to say, litigation is hard to predict but I would use about the same level as 2018, not including the $28 million TCPA settlement.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Darren Aftahi: I just want to follow up on the homebuilder question and kind of two parts to it. First, of the other major homebuilders you kind of haven't maybe publicly said you were working with. Is there any pushback to working with you or just kind of a function of time? And I'm kind of curious if there's more of a broader strategy with some of the commercial property side folks that build on that side in terms of breaking into your SMB as part of a long-term strategy. And I think last year, you guys disclosed your ending sub number for 2017, and I'm curious what that was for 2018.
Steve Trundle: Sure. I'll start with the last question. In my prepared remarks, I commented that we had entered the year with more than 6.1 million subscribers, and that's not inclusive of any subscribers that are IP license only. And then back to the former question on the builder business, there are a lot of builders that are big-name builders. There happen to also be a lot of local builders, and there's a lot of activity there that it wouldn't really rise to the top of being press-release worthy but is happening every day. I don't think yet there's a standard. I think builders are still experimenting with what their strategy should be, and some are beginning to move. I think one indicator of a mover is DR Horton where they've probably moved and been maybe a little more visionary, but I think there's not yet an answer. If I'm a builder, it's not yet known or the market hasn't said, this is what you do if you are a builder. They're still sort of trying to figure out what they should be doing around smart home, experimenting with a lot of things, and therefore, the sales cycles can be drawn out as opposed to, say, in other markets where folks know they need to do something, and we're simply trying to win versus one of our competitors. Your question on commercial and can we parlay that offering into a builder oriented program, to answer your question, we have not gotten that far. We're not doing that today, but one can envision if we have strength, for example with REETs on the resi side that perhaps we could build strength with the REETs on the commercial side and try to do more there, but we're not doing that today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Pavan [ph] on for Mike Latimore. I have two questions. Like, how many distributors are now selling your commercial offering?
Steve Valenzuela: So, the question is how many distributors are currently selling our commercial offering?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
Steve Valenzuela: So, we have a total of service provider partners of 8,000 plus that we've announced. We've typically added about a thousand service providers per year. If you look at a number of those service providers that are coming up going through our training program, we haven't actually disclosed a number. It's still a relatively small number relative to the overall 8,000, but basically, each quarter, we're going through a training program. We're training the service providers and their technicians on a regular basis. We haven't really disclosed that number though.
Steve Trundle: I don't know if we know the exact number. I think maybe the color that I gave in my prepared remarks was on the access side. We had trained 1,500 technicians, and then I think on the broader commercial line, I stated a number of individual companies we've trained, to that would be a pretty good indicator. Roughly right now, the commercial is still a small part of our base, but around 3% of the base in terms of those who are paying for commercial subscription plans.
Unidentified Analyst: And could commercial revenue surplus 10% of gross revenues this year? Can we expect that?
Steve Valenzuela: So, 10% of revenue, certainly the opportunity is there for the future. I wouldn't say that that would be a realistic goal for this year. Certainly, the potential is for commercial to contribute given that it's their early stage. Keep in mind, we just launched Alarm.com for Business a little bit, actually, less than a year ago and smarter access control. While we're seeing good performance there, it's still off of a small base. The longer-term opportunity clearly is quite significant given that there's over 4 million properties just in North America that we think actually are a valid tempera for us for commercial. But as Steve said, today, about 3% of our subscribers are commercial-paying businesses. Now, the RPU there is about two times that of the residential, two to three times, so there is a higher amount of RPU from commercial, but I would say a 10% number would be an aggressive percent of revenue for 2019.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jack Vander Aarde with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Jack Vander Aarde: Steve Trundle, so, given earlier commentary regarding Connect platform enhancements and the new ADT offering. Do these enhancements to the Connect platform create potential for new or multiple pricing tiers within the existing Connect business model?
Steve Trundle: So, the existing Connect model, it's SaaS-like, but just to be clear, it is an on-premise deployment of the Connect software, and the new offering is more like the traditional Alarm.com-hosted SaaS offering. If I speak about Connect, on that, I think we're going to take direction from our customer on what capabilities they feel are most important for their base of more than 2 million subscribers on Pulse and really let the customer drive the way they want to implement pricing tiers, so I probably don't have an answer for you there.
Jack Vander Aarde: Can you answer if the new enhancements to the Connect platform result in higher operating costs to you guys as Alarm?
Steve Trundle: So, the new offering is just, for clarity, it's not a Connect-based offering. It's a different software offering. And the new offering, it will have, for us, higher operating costs because we're rendering the full stack of services with that offering. Yes.
Jack Vander Aarde: That's helpful. And then do you plan to continue to break out this Connect versus core Alarm SaaS profile going forward?
Steve Valenzuela: So, we've broken it out for 2018. We haven't decided whether or not we're going to be breaking out going forward, honestly, at this point in time. We provided that in the past. It may not be as relevant breakout for the future given the change to the new Command platform, but we'll update you on the first quarter conference call.
Jack Vander Aarde: And if I could just ask one more, is there any change, given that hardware GM was flat Q-for-Q but down year-over-year, strong video sales again. Is there a change in the margin profile or the cost structure of the new video hardware versus last year's models of hardware that were sold?
Steve Trundle: Probably a bit of a change. It's mainly mix driven. It's what are the higher volume products that are being sold. And then I think someone earlier asked a question about analytics and are we anxious to get analytics more broadly deployed. The answer there would be yes. So, you can imagine if you're in our shoes, we want to do as much as we can to lower the impedance of getting that capability in the market. And as I've said before, our goal is to help our service providers create new customers. The customer lifetime value we think is very high, so there will be times where we're not that worried about the hardware margins if we think we're going in the right direction in terms of creating customer lifetime value.
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
56;ALRM;2019-05-09;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Alarm.com’s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  As a reminder, today's program may be recorded. And now I’d like to introduce your host for today's program David Trone, Vice President of Investor relations. Please go ahead.
David Trone: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alarm.com’s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Joining us today from Alarm.com are Steve Trundle, President and CEO; and Steve Valenzuela, CFO.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, David, and welcome to everyone joining our call today. We are pleased to report a strong start to 2019 as our first quarter results exceeded our expectation. Our SaaS and license revenue in the first quarter was $80.1 million compared to $68 million in Q1 of 2018. And our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $24.3 million, compared to $23 million a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to focus on expanding our solutions with new capabilities for our service providers and their customers. We made significant enhancements to both our commercial services platform, called Alarm.com for Business and our residential solution. We also released a new award-winning capability to help our service providers deploy our technology more efficiently. Let me begin with our commercial offering. Last year at this time, we launched Alarm.com for Business and we've steadily expanded the offering since. This past quarter, we introduced a few significant new software-based capabilities. First, we continued to enhance our Access Control solution. We integrated Access Control into our enterprise console dashboard to enable customers with many locations to manage everything in one place. From a single web view, users can add and delete users, manage access points and user permissions and define schedules across multiple locations and security partitions. This capability significantly expands the range of installations our Access Control solution can handle. In addition, we applied our market leading AI engine that we call the Insights Engine to the high volumes of data coming from our Access Control solution. Leveraging machine learning, our solution can intelligently detect and alert the right personnel about irregular or unexpected events, pre-determining and configuring all the different conditions that might warrant receiving an alert can be challenging. Our Insights Engine now does this on behalf of the commercial subscriber. This will be a valued capability for any business and its value increases with the scale of the installation in terms of the number of access points, the number of employees and the number of locations. During the quarter, we also significantly enhanced our commercial video service. As with Access Control, we have integrated live video into our enterprise console, enabling subscribers to manage and monitor video feeds from multiple geographic locations using a single interface view.
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your question please.
Adam Tindle: Afternoon. I just want to start, Steve Trundle, the moving parts, the competitive landscape in adjacent channels, you probably noticed a sizable acquisition announced this morning in the premium home automation space. I know one of the growth drivers for Alarm.com is adding more service provider partners and that's not a direct comparison, it's a different channel, but just thinking about new dealers choosing a channel, does this get more challenging with the Control4-SnapAV entity and any broad comments on competitive landscape changes?
Steve Trundle: Sure, Adam. Yes, I did notice the announcement this morning. It -- from our perspective, it's sort of a non-event, in that we're not really seeing competition from either Control4 or SnapAV. I think both are in a bit more of the custom integrator space, doing higher-end systems typically and also doing systems that are less sort of security-first, or security-centric. So, at times, we have request to integrate with various products from both of those providers, but we haven't really heard of service providers sort of standing on the doors of a customer and hearing that the customer is trying to make a choice between us and, as an example, Control4. In fact, some customers probably have both. They're using us for security and video and Control4 for automation and maybe even using SnapAV components for a high-end AV system. So on that front, I would say, it's interesting, but it's not really a material event from our perspective, and I think the rest of the competitive landscape has sort of remained the same over the last -- over the last quarter.
Adam Tindle: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on guidance for Q2. The SaaS and license revenue would suggest a lower than seasonal sequential uplift. I think it's typically 4% or 5% when you strip out Icontrol historically, and you're implying more like flattish. You now have the Command platform nationwide for a full quarter. Any incremental benefit from video, analytics and commercial, if you could just maybe speak to why we wouldn't see at least the same seasonality as before. Is there an underlying aspect of challenges in the core that's offsetting, is there some conservative approach to guidance. Just trying to understand what the message implies. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Sure. Now, good question. So those things you mentioned are all going relatively well. So those are -- those are thus far looking positive, but I mentioned in my prepared comments that we had a nice win with SoCalGas and then they were very effective in -- actually in the first quarter, adding a lot of subscribers very quickly and that generated a pretty meaningful revenue event for us in the first quarter that -- that is partially responsible for our first quarter beat. But that revenue is seasonal revenue that we would expect to see again, hopefully in Q1 of 2020. It comes around once a year, because it's tied to those points in time when people are actually using their heating systems, and we're not going to see that revenue repeat in the second quarter. So with that sort of a drop, some of those other things that you mentioned as positives are making up some of the gap, but that -- that sort of is a function of the lumpiness in this demand response revenue more than anything.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.
Nikolay Beliov: Thanks for taking my questions. A question for Steve Trundle positive. Steve, how do you track your progress in the commercial space? What are the key underlying metrics you look at on a regular basis to evaluate how you're guys progressing there and if you can give us the update on the percentage of service providers that you've trained to sell your commercial offering? And lastly, how important is this STANLEY relationship? How big -- if you could just give us an idea of how big their market presence is.
Steve Trundle: Sure. Yeah, several questions there. So I'll do the best I can. I may not have all of the metrics right at my fingertips, but at a high level, we're watching sort of the percentage of customers coming on, who we believe are commercial enterprises. And then what percentage of those are taking one of our commercial plans. And we've seen growth in both of those metrics, meaning the gross commercial acquisition rate is higher, some of those customers come on one of our base residential plans, but a growing percentage of them are coming on one of the commercial plans. So we're watching that. And then on the Access Control side, we're watching the actual number of doors being activated on the network per day, or per week and we obviously -- that can't grow fast enough. The faster that's growing the better. So that's a metric we watch. I'm not going to break out exactly what that number is at this point, but it's going in the right direction. With regard to STANLEY, each of these -- each of our large partners, it takes a while to get them trained up to speed, get them -- separate their pricing and whatnot. But STANLEY is a very sophisticated operator in the commercial space and is known for real focus on operational excellence. And we therefore we're pleased with ourselves in a way that we were selected as the platform for their SMB offering. I think it's validating that a lot of the investments we've been making over the last year, and that I talked about -- when I talked about our 2019 strategy, are beginning to -- are beginning to come to fruition. So I would view at this point as a nice validation of our efforts. And then it will take some time to -- to really be contributing as a revenue source, just like any new relationship does.
Nikolay Beliov: Thanks, Steve. And a really quick question for Steve Valenzuela. Steve, can you help us in terms of how to model cash flow for the year? Is EBITDA less some estimate of litigation expenses, less the TCPA payment kind of like a proxy of where cash flow should come in more or less?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. Nikolay, this is a very good question. So if you look at last quarter, we indicated that we had made the $5 million payment for the TCPA settlement in Q1. So that certainly affected the cash flow from operations and the free cash flow. Even though we recorded the expense last year, it doesn't affect your cash flow statement, until you actually making a payment. So if you took out that cash flow amount from Q1, you would see that we were actually up year-over-year in cash flow. And then keep in mind, we have an additional $23 million payment that's going to be made, the remainder, at some point later this year. That will affect the cash flow. But if you adjust for that, let's say, if you take out the $28 million one-time event here for the -- for the settlement, the cash flow should be up slightly year-over-year. Whereas, last year, we did about $49 million in free cash flow, the year before we did $47 million. And so, it's still early in the year, the things that could go affecting the cash flow, but where we sit today, we would expect cash flow to be up slightly year-over-year, taking the legal settlement out of that consideration.
Nikolay Beliov: Got it, got it. Thanks so much.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Jefferies. Your question please.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks. This is Parthiv on for John. Just a quick follow-up on the STANLEY announcement. You guys talked about the size of the commercial installed base over there. I'm just curious, is there room for any of that existing installed base on the SMB side to port over to Alarm over time, or is this a new bookings opportunity looking ahead?
Steve Trundle: No, I think over time it will be both. Our hope is that, that we can provide enough value with the platform that a system manager  solution provider like STANLEY would have a vested interest in putting the majority of their customers on the platform. They get more efficiencies when they do that, they're able to use the platform for a lot of business intelligence reporting, customer engagement reporting, customer exception reporting. So we hope that we create incentives that would allow us to compete for upgrades into the existing base. That obviously takes some time, customers become acquainted with the system they already have, that their employees are trained on and you don't just sort of go in overnight and switch them all up. But you look for opportunities to present to the customer additional value you can provide with an improved offering and then you make that upgrade. So I think we'll see some contribution from both parts of that business.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then is there any contribution from STANLEY baked into sort of the current revenue guide?
Steve Valenzuela: Typically, when we actually provide guidance, we are cautious not to include future programs or new programs, it's still as -- just recently announced, right. This is Steve Venezuela, by the way, so our guidance strategy is not to include new programs that are at the early stages.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, got it. Thank you so much.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gearhart from First Analysis. Your question please. David, you might have your phone on mute.
David Gearhart: Hi, good afternoon. Sorry about that, my phone was on mute. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question has to do with one of your large customers MONI or Brinks Security. It was publicized that they've missed a debt payment and there are some things going on there. Just wondering if you've seen any change in your relationship or how you're thinking about working with that client.
Steve Trundle: No, so we have not seen a change in our -- in our relationship, nor has that changed the way we think about working with that service provider. In fact, I feel we have seen the quality of the customer they're creating from our perspective is steadily improving. They have, in some domains, sort of right-sized, I would say, and they have focused on creating higher quality customers that are more engaged with their system. So we like that and we are treating them and acting in a way where they are just sort of a regular customer, obviously a very important one. But we are not really involved in their restructuring effort and it doesn't really affect the way we work with them.
David Gearhart: Okay. And then lastly, could you provide an update on either -- on actually both excuse, ADT and their new platform, if you see an increasing activity as a result of their platform update and their efforts, as well as what you're seeing in the new builder channel in the program that you have there? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Sure. Yeah, on that front, what I would say is ADT reported a couple days ago, I believe, their results and they did spend some time speaking about the launch of their new platform. And in summary, I think they are satisfied. It's early days, obviously, but they indicated satisfaction with how it's going and early signs of a lot of positive activity. And my perspective is, if they're satisfied, then we're satisfied. So that's probably about the most I can share, since it's really their system at this point, but I'm happy to see that it's going well and that they're satisfied with it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi from ROTH Capital Partners. Your question please.
Darren Aftahi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One think I didn't hear in the call, just anything about international, love to get an update there, just percentage of revenue. And then on your other revenue with SoCalGas, is there way you could quantify that? Thanks.
Steve Valenzuela: So, Darren. It's the Venezuela. So international, we typically don't break out every quarter, but what we can say is year-over-year we've seen good growth. And in terms of the actual accounts have been accredited, the creation is up over 50% year-over-year. And so we're seeing progress. Last quarter actually Steve Trundle talked about a number of new programs in international. I think what we've mentioned in the past is these programs do take longer to launch, because you're dealing with different standards, different requirements in different countries, but we've seen good strategic momentum internationally, it just takes time to really -- to have those agreements really start generating revenue. But we have seen good growth in terms of the account creation year-over-year.
Steve Trundle: One thing I would add there is, is the win at STANLEY is -- STANLEY is a brand that's known well in North America, but it's also -- that business is actually larger in rest of world, in the security space than it is in North America. So we treat that as an international win and it's sort of good on two fronts and that it's validating on the commercial side. And then, you wouldn't be able to win that business if you weren't able to scale globally. So it's validating on some of the investments we've made to build out our Rest of World presence as well.
Steve Valenzuela: And I think one of your other questions was quantifying the SoCalGas program. So obviously, we can't provide details of our customers' revenue. What I would say is, point you to our 10-Q, where we do break out the Other segment. We've seen good growth within PointCentral, EnergyHub and also our other segment vertical businesses in our Other segment. Actually, this quarter the Other segment, which includes those businesses, account for about 8% of total revenue, a year ago they account for about 6.5% of revenue, and achieved very strong SaaS revenue growth year-over-year. So I think that would probably help you.
Darren Aftahi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland Capital. Your question please.
Unidentified Participant: Yeah, hi. This is Pawan  on for Mike Latimore. Like, can you please give an update on your video analytics service? Is there any qualitative or quantitative information related to the residential or business market?
Steve Trundle: Sure, so the updates are, we saw the uptake steadily increasing during the first quarter. We're probably not going to break out the exact percentages of people that are taking video analytics, but the adoption, I would say is going the way that we had hoped it would go and I think that's because the user experience with that offering is very differentiated right now and is far superior to an offering that doesn't use intelligence to be more selective in surgical, in the content that you present to the end user. So, it's going well. In my prepared comments I talked about expanding the lineup of cameras that are able to work with our video analytics engine to include the rest of our commercial cameras. So we got that done in the -- in the first quarter and really until you can support the full lineup of cameras with a software feature like that, you're a bit hamstrung in how quickly you can roll out, but we've gotten that done in the first quarter and things are generally going pretty well with it. I think I also spoke about the Highlights feature, which is only really enabled with video analytics with subscribers. So that's something we've done on the residential side, primarily, where we've really made an effort to give someone a short perform, very quick view of everything important that's happened around their home during the day all in about 20 seconds and we're using the video analytics engine do that. So you're seeing us continue to invest in it, and I think those investments will continue to drive adoption.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Vander Aarde from Maxim Group. Your question please.
Jack Vander Aarde: Yeah, hey guys. How many homebuilder partners do you guys now have or is that something you can share?
Steve Valenzuela: So we've talked about D.R. Horton and Toll Brothers. Those are public. I think there certainly are other programs with our dealers that have local builders. But those are the two public ones we've talked about in the past, Toll Brothers and D.R. Horton, there may be others.
Steve Trundle: Yes, I think that's what we have spoke -- I would just say this, if we -- if we do a relationship with a large national homebuilder, we will attempt to announce it in some way, shape or form. And if we haven't announced it, you can probably assume we don't -- we're probably not in a big -- we are not really engaged with someone. And then what I would add is, there are thousands of smaller homebuilders in the different local markets, custom builders that may only build five homes a year. And this is a place where our service providers are very strong and that they oftentimes have relationships with those local builders and there are more relationships there than we would even know about, but I would say it's a pretty high number, we just don't even know what the number is.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay, that's helpful. And then for Steve V, you mentioned video camera sales were strong and hardware gross margin was down due to product mix. Can you just discuss what specific products had a drag on gross margin and if your guidance -- maintained guidance for the year on EBITDA assumes gross margin will return to the 20% or 22% range?
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah, Jack, typically hardware margins have ranged from 18% to 20% more recently. I know it's been -- sometimes they have been higher. The interesting thing is there is a mix even within cameras of different margin. So it really depends on the mix in that quarter. So it really is related to product mix, that really is driving it, even within cameras drives their product mix. I would say probably in Q1, we probably had a little bit more mix of the lower margin cameras than we would probably expect. Again, I would think that -- I would think that modeling 18% to 20% for hardware margins is probably a reasonable way to going forward.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Captain from Stifel. Your question please.
Jeff Captain: Hey, guys, I was just wondering if you can give more color on what's causing the slowdown in the core business if you pull out the -- that added benefit from SoCal this quarter?
Steve Trundle: Well, yeah, I'm not sure if we pulled that out, which -- not positive that we would be portraying -- obviously, if we pull out that result, we would -- we would not have the lumpiness in Q1. I'm not sure exactly how things would look at that point, but I think they would look pretty close to the normal growth rate that we have guided for the year, if not a little bit above that.
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah, probably above that. Right.
Jeff Captain: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Steve Valenzuela: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session, as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation, you may now disconnect. Good day.";[-0.046283337614772435, -0.019001046603067007];-0.019001046603067007;-0.046283337614772435;0
57;ALRM;2019-08-09;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Alarm.com's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. . Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call to David Trone, Vice President, Investor Relations.
David Trone: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alarm.com's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Joining us today from Alarm.com are Steve Trundle, President and CEO, and Steve Valenzuela, CFO.
Stephen Trundle: Thanks, David, and welcome to everyone joining our call today. We are pleased to report another solid quarter that exceeded our expectations. SaaS and license revenue in the second quarter grew to $82.3 million, up 16% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $27.7 million. During the quarter, our service providers continued to have success in the market. They added new subscribers and increasingly deployed our more advanced services. One particular area of strength for our service providers, continues to be with our video services. For the first six months of the year, the number of subscribers electing a video service plan is up about 40% from the first half of 2018. Adoption of our video analytics service, which we initially released at the end of last year, continues to grow as well. The improved user experience and quality of service enabled by video analytics is driving increased overall demand for video. Overall, I am pleased with our progress in the video category. As I have stated previously, we have been steadily increasing our focus in this area. We have both ramped up our internal R&D investments and made select acquisitions to strengthen our tech stack and provide a solid product to service providers. The market is highly competitive, but we are competing well. In order to continue to innovate in the video category and in other growth categories like commercial and access control, we have worked hard to further build out our R&D team. We ended the second quarter with an R&D team of 554 employees, not including contractors. As the rest of the year unfolds, we expect to continue to invest in strengthening our capacity to drive best-in-class products and innovation into the markets we serve. During the second quarter, we also expanded the ecosystem of supported third-party hardware products that work with the Alarm.com platform. A particular focus was on the IoT devices that our builder channel partners desire. We added devices  Eaton and Leviton which are brands that we see builders frequently installing for lighting control. These additions fit nicely with existing integrations for audio, video, lock control, shape control and smart thermostats. With the array of best-in-class devices available in our ecosystem, builders can tailor solutions for the target buyers and the design aesthetics of a given community. This quarter, we also significantly expanded our lineup of supported security control panels to give our service providers additional options to install in their customers properties. Importantly, we advanced the capabilities available to our service providers, by working with our existing control panel partners on new models that they are bringing to market. With expanded touch screen interfaces and our LTE dual-path gateways, we can now offer new capabilities to subscribers such as display and video feeds on the control panel.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks, Steve. I will begin with a review of our second quarter 2019 financial results and then provide guidance for the third quarter and our raised outlook for the full year 2019 before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the second quarter grew 16% from the same quarter last year to $82.3 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $11 million for the second quarter compared to $10.2 million for Q2 2018. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate was 94% in the second quarter, at the high end of our historical range of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenue in the second quarter of $39.3 million, up 17.3% over Q2 2018. The increase in hardware revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales of our video cameras. As Steve mentioned, we continue to see increasing adoption of video by both new and existing subscribers. Total revenue for the second quarter was $121.7 million, up 16.4% over the same quarter last year. SaaS and license gross margin for the second quarter was 84.6%, consistent with prior quarters. Hardware gross margin was 18.9% for the second quarter compared to 24% for the same quarter last year primarily due to product mix. Total gross margin was 63.4% for the second quarter compared to 65.1% for the same quarter last year, mainly due to lower hardware margins.
Operator: . Our first question is from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.
Jacqueline Cheong: Hi, this is actually Jacqueline Cheong on for Nikolay. Quick question on when do you think international and commercial revenues will inflect and what is the adoption curve of customers in regards to those 2 segments?
Stephen Trundle: Sure. Hi, Ashley. I don't know that you'll see sort of an overnight type of inflection move in the chart. We're seeing steady sort of quarter-over-quarter increases in the number, both the absolute number of customers we're putting on in both of those segments and that's sort of with a nice growth rate. But I don't think you're going to see sort of a big bang moment, partially a reason for that is we're building basically a long-term path to market by educating service providers in those various segments, making sure they're trained. You've got a fair amount of set-up required which of course creates its own nice barrier to entry. But we think we're making good progress long term. We can see, if we think about international, we've always said we think international can and eventually will be as much as a third of the business and we're sort of tracking early days at the moment, but tracking towards that goal.
Jacqueline Cheong: And any comment on the adoption curve of customers?
Stephen Trundle: Customers -- do you mean our commercial customers. The adoption curve of customers. I'm not sure I understand what you meant, Ashely.
Jacqueline Cheong: Like, how do they typically roll out with Alarm.com? How does that trend over time?
Stephen Trundle: Okay. So if we go -- really, when we think about customers, there are 2 levels. There is the service provider and that adoption cycle is typically a year of evaluation of testing of maybe some piloting, some in-house work towards the end of that period. I think we, of course, are working to complete contracts and we are beginning the training. They're preparing their go-to-market pricing. So, you're basically looking with typical meaningful service provider, whether it'd be domestic going into the commercial segment or international, a year, maybe a little more in some cases of preparation and everyone getting comfort. You have to remember that what we offer is sort of core to their business and core to how they present themselves. So, it can be a meaningful transition. Once we get that work done most partners will de-risk the process by sort of gradually turning the lights on and that process itself may take another year to year and a half as they literally go from one geography to the next, to the next, and begin the deployment. When you get into sort of non-US markets, you do see some additional obstacles, which would be, regulatory environments by country may vary. So, you may have a service provider that's doing business in 2 different countries that are adjacent to each other. One has different set of regulatory requirements and the other one may take a little longer, but generally, we think about sort of a -- from day 1 to sort of fully deployed ramp being 2 year, 2.5 year type of ramp at the service provider level. Then, obviously at the customer level, it gets turned on, it works and they're happy on day two. So once you create the end customer, that adoption is very quick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.
Adam Tindle: Steve Trundle, I just wanted to start, first, by acknowledging obviously SaaS and license revenue growth quite healthy versus expectations. And I don't think the macro environment is great based on the results in the channel around you, but there obviously has been some investor consternation around a couple of quarters of moderation in SaaS growth on a year-over-year basis and your forward guidance indicates that's going to continue. So, just hoping you could maybe take a second to parse through some of the drivers of that moderation between churn, ARPU trends, gross adds, maybe just go through each, how it's impacted so far this year, and some of the potential drivers to those as the year progresses with the initiatives that you have.
Stephen Trundle: Sure. Yeah, Adam. So as you said so far, we're only 6 months into the year, but so far the year has progressed at a -- I'd say, at a better rate than probably we expected at the beginning of the year. I think we began the year forecasting sort of a 13% growth rate on the SaaS line anyway and with the increase on guide that we have out now, we've moved that up to 14.5%. So the year is -- things are probably better than we expected. I think if we go sort of to the internal market drivers, it's such a diverse market and you can have parts that are doing very well while you have other parts that are a little soft. I think as you look at us, you have, I think, Steve just commented. As example, rev retention is actually going pretty well. We're at the high end of our range at 94% but you have to keep in mind that each year, the base that you're attempting to retain is also getting bigger. So the impact of even that 6% is more meaningful and that's of course, revenue attrition that we have to replace each year. So you have that as a driver. If we look, sort of, at the market right now, I think, we've seen slightly tighter credit market than what we're historically used to, especially in North America and that can be somewhat constraining for our service providers and this really gets to sort of what -- how much will a lender loan against subscriber acquisition cost, the number's a little lower now than it was probably 2 years ago. I think everyone sort of sorting out exactly what the new entrants are doing, whether they are having an impact on the market. Our take is, really not. I mean we've always said that the DIY and sort of the point product segment has existed. It hasn't really had an impact on our core addressable market of those people who want to have professional monitor security. That continues to be the case, but folks are trying to sort that. So, you've got a bunch of, kind of, inside the market drivers and then you have, in our case, certain amount of latency as we configure and operationalize various segments associated with our growth initiatives. So, it's hard to predict exactly when. I think, the question a moment ago was, when's the inflection point. It's hard to sort of predict exactly when that inflection point will be. And there's really not ever an absolute inflection. It just takes some time to build into those initiatives. So those are some of the things we're seeing, but like I said so far, on a year-to-date basis, we're pleased with the market being -- probably, the market being a bit healthier than we would have thought at the beginning of the year.
Adam Tindle: Okay. That's really helpful. And maybe just a follow up, obviously acknowledging revenue performance has been very strong and raised. The adjusted EBITDA guidance is actually, I think, been kept at this level for a couple of quarters after some solid performance on that number and I think the benefit from the impairment charge reversal this quarter. I imagine maybe there is some exogenous factors in there. I don't know if maybe tariffs are impacting or indication for appetite for increased spending. So, maybe just some of the buckets that lead you to keep the adjusted EBITDA guidance at the same level.
Stephen Trundle: I think, it's kind of a couple of things. So first, on the opportunity side, we an internal struggle for us is we're excited enough about the different opportunities that we see, especially when we think about where we want the business to be in 5 to 10 years. That we really sometimes struggle to prioritize and make decisions on which domain is best to invest in. Do you invest in creating commercial for international or do you invest in additional capabilities for video for your average domestic customers. Sort of that constant tug of war that we face. And we think, actually, all of those or nearly all of those things that were staring at represent good places to deploy capital. So, we already have sort of a natural internal tension that makes me a little bit reticent to want to put ourselves in a place where we're more constrained in the amount of investment that we can actually make to go after long-term opportunity. So, I have a natural sort of desire to preserve our capacity, if you will, to build the company over the long haul. So you got that tension. This year's been a little bit special, and probably in terms of how we've moved relative to what we initially guided. This has been a year where we've needed to keep an eye on Twitter literally and we have had some uncertainty emerge around tariffs and what those cost will be to the business. The mere sort of presence of that dynamic has at times created some disruption in the supply chain. So, we've been reticent, I think, to get comfortable that all of those issues just sort of go away in the next month. And I think, we're pleased that we've been able to stick by our prior guide but we're kind of reluctant to jump out in front of it while there is so much still going on in that domain.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Hey, Steve, I wonder if you could just flush out the approach on tariffs? Can you just remind us kind of where you are in the process today and then to the extent we get this next round, how should we think about kind of sourcing and other areas versus maybe an ability to pass that on to customers?
Stephen Trundle: Right. So the way we think about it, yeah, we've had some exposure already on a year-to-date basis with products like the Alarm.com Smart Thermostat with some of our cameras. About a third of our overall hardware product is actually produced in China. A larger component of the, I mean, when you get down the component level, so even things that we produce in our Utica, New York facility or that we produce in Mexico, one of the componentry is coming from China specifically Baoding and recently we've seen List -- we know List 4 is in development. There is an emerging set of tariff costs there. So I think we're all sort of trying to figure it out, but the way we think about it, first, we are seeing indications from our suppliers that in most cases there, they're making real efforts to move effective parts of their operations to other countries that where the tariffs wouldn't apply. So we're seeing some of that transition. We are looking occasionally shifting things around. So I think, if everyone had a year and knew this was coming, then you'd probably see a lot of preparation for it and supply chains would have been sort of ready. I think the fact, you just can't move something, especially proprietary product, you can't move it overnight from one place to the other. So that's the dynamic we see. In terms of the way the that costs flow through in our -- I think each company treats it differently. You try to get it out of your suppliers. So, if you can't get it there, at some point, either the company, meaning we or the end customer, or someone in the middle has to absorb the tariff cost and it's sort of on a case-by-case basis by product. But generally I think our service providers understand that this is not -- you look at the gross margins, we run on hardware and you look at which are intentionally low and you look at this additional cost and most are understanding that there is a new tariff cost and as long as we call that out, we can pass through the bulk of it.
Steve Valenzuela: Kevin, one thing we've done as well is we have set up a warehouse in Taiwan for international customers. So, we don't have to ship it through the U.S., bear the tariffs. So, we'll go directly from Taiwan to Europe and Asia.
Kevin McVeigh: That's super helpful. And then just, if I heard right, did you say the commercial opportunity could be about a third of revenue. If so, is that primarily just based on the STANLEY deal you signed already or would that assume some penetration in the U.S. as well. And what type of time frame you think, would it take to kind of get to that level of contribution?
Stephen Trundle: Yeah, Kevin, it's Steve Trundle. I hope I said on, when I threw out the third number, I meant to say that we saw long-term international being about a third of our of revenue. So I think that's not a new kind of guidepost for us. We've always felt that would be the case. I don't think we've really put out an estimate on percentage of revenue long term that will be commercial. What we have said is, it's kind of early days. It's a growing category. It's growing nicely right now, but I don't think we're at the point of -- to project long-term percentage of revenue there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Reed Motulsky with Imperial Capital.
Reed Motulsky: As the provider of the back end of the Command and Control system what will be Alarm.com's responsibilities and possibly fees regarding providing education and back up customer service for those installing the new system.
Stephen Trundle: Hi. So, what are our responsibilities to -- you said to educate those installing the new Command and Control system?
Reed Motulsky: Yes.
Stephen Trundle: Basically in that case, Command and Control is ADT's new system and ADT is really owning the deployment of that technology and they're doing a great job with it and they take ownership of training the installers and the technicians and have been training installers and technicians for years. So it's right in their wheelhouse. Our role is really to support them the best we can making sure we're getting them any information they might need from us, but we're not front and center in that educational process.
Reed Motulsky: Nice and what types of pipeline discussions Alarm.com having regarding its EnergyHub subsidiary and what are the types of clients and the types of services that the company is discussing?
Stephen Trundle: So with EnergyHub, it's really more of the same and I think we've indicated in prior quarters that's a place where we have some momentum. We're pleased with the management team and the entire team there and what we're trying to build out are essentially the benefits of scale. We add on each quarter. We tend to add on meaningful additional utilities who want to reduce carbon emissions and who want to be able to level load their production. And at the same time, we go back and we work with the IoT companies and including almost anyone that wants to work with EnergyHub to make sure that we're able to connect to and gather information from each of those devices. So, those are the basic two marching orders for that business. They're doing a good job on both of those vectors and as they continue to make progress, I would say, they become relevant to more utilities and likewise relevant to more IoT device makers and that's sort of what we have going on. So we didn't talk about them specifically, but it's been continuing to see good progress there, and those are the 2 things they're really focused on.
Reed Motulsky: Got it. And can you -- I know you guys touched on Europe a bit earlier, but can you guys also talk about Australia and Asia, if there's any progress being made there or if it's slowed down the priorities list here?
Stephen Trundle: Sure. So Australia continues to, I don't think I have a meaningful update this quarter. As far as I can remember, it's been sort of continued progress. We did set up an office there in Sydney. So we're beginning, I think, high level. You're seeing us begin to get comfortable with the long-term opportunities and markets when we make the decision to put physical offices in the ground and a location. We did that in the prior quarter in Australia. Southeast Asia's still very early, more of a pipeline stage there where we are talking to service providers in each of the geographical markets, but don't have any. I wouldn't say we don't have traction, we're happy with the pipeline, and the testing and what not, but we're not driving a lot of revenue out of Southeast Asia yet.
Operator: Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies.
Parthiv Varadarajan: This is Parthiv on for John. You guys talked briefly about the 3G upgrade opportunity in your prepared remarks. I just wanted to get a sense. Is there any quantitative or qualitative color you could maybe give us to help us size that opportunity over the next couple of years and that would be both, I guess, within your current installed base and the broader market that might be up for grabs.
Stephen Trundle: Yes, I mean, so qualitatively, there are meaningful set of subscribers that are already Alarm.com subscribers and our service with 3G connections. If we took the percentage of our overall subscriber base where we are contracted to actually provide the cellular communication capability and we're actively providing that, it's roughly a third, around 30% or so of our subscribers and our intent is to upgrade them as much as we can. Again, with our partners through normal course. So we've run some different types of campaigns. I think in most cases, we see it as an opportunity to go back to the customer upgrade, the functionality to more modern functionality, probably add cameras. And then, we have to also work hard with our service providers. For some of them, it's a meaningful issue that we're managing through. It creates even for our service provider both opportunity and then also at some point. Let's say, we're talking about 2022 time frame, but at some point that gets closer than it is today, and we won't have to accelerate the pace, but we've seen them move out pretty well this year. We ran a nice campaign at the beginning of the year and it got a lot of people moving and we're happy with how that's going.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Latimore with Northland Capital.
Michael Latimore: This is Pawan on for Mike. I have two questions. How many service providers are selling commercial now and what percent are sold like at least something?
Steve Valenzuela: So the question was what percent of service providers are selling commercial?
Michael Latimore: Yes, yes, exactly.
Steve Valenzuela: Boy, I don't have that data point unfortunately right in front of me to give you and we may not actually have it readily available here. So can't really answer that question. What I can maybe give you as an indicative -- an indication is about 4% of our new subscribers are coming on to a commercial service plan. I think that's pretty widely distributed across service providers. And with that rate, obviously, the commercial customer is using a lot of capabilities that may not be applicable to a residential subscriber. So that commercial customer is generating or that base of customers -- that 4% are generating about 8% of the new subscription revenue.
Stephen Trundle: So, we're training service providers all the time. So that number keeps on changing and keeps on growing. Clearly, that's a focus for us in terms of providing them the training.
Michael Latimore: Okay. And how many people in the R&D department are working on video analytics.
Stephen Trundle: Good question, yeah. I think if you took video as an overall category, you've got cameras in there. You got end user functionality, how that video is rendered inside the app, different types of interfaces for scrubbing through video. I'm going to sort of leave all of that out and just say that the video analytics team is -- and actually, I have said, I don't want to reveal exactly that how many we have working, but I'll give you an idea that it's dozens, but not hundreds that are actually video scientists who are working every day on improving that offering and that's probably what I would say there.
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah, in January of 2017 we required video objects which brought on the initial team and we've grown that team quite a bit since then, that's really the beginning stages, with all their knowledge, 18 years or 17 years of knowledge they brought working with many different government programs we've enhanced that team quite a bit over the last couple of years.
Operator: And our next question comes from Darren Aftahi with ROTH Capital Partners.
Darren Aftahi: Just two, if I may, First, could you disclose what other SaaS revenue was in the second quarter and then Steve Trundle, your commentary about 40% video growth over the first half. I'm just kind of curious if you'd kind of break that down between kind of your core video service and then perhaps add-ons like video analytics, what's making up that component?
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah, and I'll start with the first question. Other SaaS -- other segment was $4.2 million in Q2. That was up about 46% year-over-year. It was down sequentially from Q1 which was around $4.6 million.
Stephen Trundle: And then the second question was, where is the video growth coming from. And I guess, I'd just say, generally at this point, If we look back a year, about a fourth of all the installations were coming on with the video subscription. Today, that number is above a third. So we're just seeing steadily more and more of our subscriber base even at time of install opt for video and then a meaningful number of existing customers that may not have the capability or requesting it. The breakdown is, I do think I made the point in my prepared remarks that, analytics, If I were to look at those customers who have an outdoor -- one of our newer outdoor video cameras, at this point -- and we feel like that capability has only been out a bit, but 60% of them are taking analytics, simply because the capability is so nice and so much better than what's existed in the past. So, I think the availability of that technology is driving kind of a -- more or less a wholesale move, all video products are moving. The doorbell video product continues to be sort of the hot product as are the outdoor video cameras that support video analytics.
Operator: And our last question is from Jack Aarde with Maxim Group.
Jack Aarde: Hey guys, good quarter. Just had few questions on -- did I hear correctly the subsidiary business, other revenue, was $4.2 million in Q2?
Steve Valenzuela: For SaaS, that's right.
Jack Aarde: For SaaS, okay. Got you. And then, if I look at hardware and other GM -- gross margin, while it was down year-over-year, it did improve by about 140 basis points or so from last quarter, despite the tariffs and all these other cost factors. So what specifically is improving that hardware gross margin, I guess, specifically in this quarter relative to the prior quarter?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, that was up about 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter and we do run different promotions, different times because we really use hardware as an enabler for SaaS. So, we're driving really the adoption of sales with constantly lowering the price where we can of hardware products including cameras and then you've got a different mix of cameras, you have different margins and different price points. But it was really relatively -- quarter-over-quarter relatively minor change in terms of about 150 basis points.
Stephen Trundle: Yeah, I don't think we know exactly why that would move that little amount, but it was kind of just noise in the system really.
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah. We've said in the past that you should think really about hardware margins in the 18% to 20% range and we typically kind of been in that range over the last couple of quarters.
Jack Aarde: Got it, that's helpful. And if I can just ask quickly, is there any update you can share on PointCentral specifically or maybe how the partnership with Invitation Homes is developing? Any developments there you can share?
Steve Valenzuela: I -- continues to perform well. I mean, PointCentral continues to perform well. We think there is a tremendous opportunity in the multi-developments space and the rental property space. They continue to perform very well. If you look at it, they're part of the other segment and the other segment SaaS revenue was up 46% year-over-year in Q2. So they're part of that contribution.
Stephen Trundle: Maybe a more general update there. So my impression, just watching activities, Invitation's going fine. There continues to be the same installation rate and everything. So nothing really on the negative side has changed. The business has evolved some. We're beginning to include some of -- on a selective basis, some of our service providers and the fulfillment side of that business and growing into in the multifamily segment. So, we're excited about it. I don't think we have a super discrete update there this quarter, but generally, things are fine.
Jack Aarde: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks guys. Great quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A and program for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.";[-0.11700409747894847, 0.06001230910173949];0.06001230910173949;-0.11700409747894847;0
58;ALRM;2019-11-05;"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Alarm.com Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.  I would now like to introduce host of today’s conference call Mr. David Trone, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
David Trone: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alarm.com’s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Joining us today from Alarm.com are Steve Trundle, President and CEO, and Steve Valenzuela, CFO.
Steve Trundle: Thanks, David, and welcome to everyone joining our call today. We are pleased to report another solid quarter that exceeded our expectations. SaaS and license revenue in the third quarter grew to $84.9 million, up 14.3% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $26.3 million. We've had an active quarter and early fall. We introduced a number of smart home solutions and devices. In September, we gathered the entire company together over the course of several days to review our long-term strategy, product roadmap, and progress against our goals and to better connect as a team. We also recently hosted a number of our service provider partners here in Washington DC for our Annual Partner Summit to present our latest products and R&D priorities. And in late October, we announced the acquisition of OpenEye, a leading provider of video management software for commercial applications. On today's call, I'll focus on the new smart home products we launched and the acquisition of OpenEye. I'll close by providing some initial thoughts on our planning process for 2020. Starting with our product pipeline, we launched two new residential video cameras that significantly upgrade our indoor and outdoor lineup. Both cameras, presents sleek industrial designs, offer increased field of view and provide enhanced picture quality even in highly variable lighting conditions. They also have substantially increased onboard compute capacity. This improves their overall performance and gives us an edge computing environment that we can use to support the more advanced video analytic capabilities that we plan to deploy in the future. A common challenge with deploying and supporting most video cameras or other IP devices is their dependence on the subscriber's Wi-Fi network. Our two new cameras have isotropic antennas that create a more uniform and efficient wireless connection. We also recently launched the Smart Gateway, a device that provides a private and secure Wi-Fi network dedicated to Alarm.com video cameras. The Smart Gateway makes instillations easier and faster and reduces the likelihood of subsequent support issues caused by changes to the subscribers Wi-Fi network. These new products are examples of our ongoing goal to minimize inefficiencies associated with unmanaged Wi-Fi networks and to make it as easy as possible for our service provider partners to deploy our video services.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks Steve. I will begin with a review of our third quarter 2019 financial results and then provide guidance for the fourth quarter and our raised outlook for the full year of 2019. Before opening the call for questions, SaaS and license revenue in the third quarter grew 14.3% from the same quarter last year to $84.9 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $10.8 million for the third quarter, compared to $10.5 million for Q3 2018. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate was 94% in the third quarter at the high end of our historical range of 92% to 94%. Hardware and other revenue in the third quarter was $43 million, up 14.4% over Q3 2018. The increase in hardware revenue was primarily due to an increase in sales over video cameras. Total revenue for the third quarter was $127.9 million, up 14.3% over the same quarter last year. SaaS and license gross margin for the third quarter was 85.4%, up approximately 90 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly due to improved efficiencies we have been able to achieve in our network operations centers.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.
Madison Suhr: Hey, good afternoon. This is Madison on for Adam and thanks for taking my question. I know you've been expanding your presence internationally in areas such as Brazil and Chile and also adding SaaS to existing markets. As this has expanded recently, I was hoping you could talk about how this has progressed relative to your expectations and any early learnings that you can share with us. Thanks.
Steve Trundle: Sure. Madison, this is Steve Trundle speaking. I would say that generally the progress we've made internationally has been in line with our expectations at this point. We've had a few positives and a few bumps here and there, but I think we're probably more excited about the way it's shaping up for the next 12 to 15 months than – at any period in the past it's growing, it's growing at a faster rate than the rest of the business. We're – I think closing the gap on small, on the set of – we're closing the gap on all the little things that you have to get right to really deploy at scale in the international market. So in general, we're pleased and feel like its tracking about where we expected it to begin the year.
Madison Suhr: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just on hardware revenue, it looks like guidance implies a pretty meaningful decline on a sequential basis. I know there's a little bit of seasonality there, but it's obviously above what we've seen historically. Can you just talk to some of the drivers on the hardware revenue guidance? Anything outside of just typical kind of conservatism there would be helpful? Thanks.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. This is Steve Valenzuela. Typically Q4 is seasonably the weakest quarter for hardware. If you look at past Q4 is typically the lowest hardware contribution in the quarter for the year. And that's typically tied to the holiday season and people focus on a number of other things. And so it's just typically seasonably a weaker quarter of the year for hardware.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.
Nikolay Beliov: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. When you guys look at your business for the next 12 months, I know you're still doing the plan for 2020. And look at the incremental business, is there a way for you to start rank for us the major contributors by size to the incremental subscription revenues over the next 12 months. And I'm referring to maybe the new dealers you signed up, expansion with existing dealers, international, commercial, just go down the key revenue drivers. That will be helpful I think.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. I don't know if I can give you an absolutely discreet breakdown by each of those domains, but I can give you some thoughts on how we think about it. And you got some of the first parts right. So we have the core North American business that's growing at a certain clip. One of the big drivers there really has been – really there are a couple of drivers that also play internationally. But especially in North America, the success we've had with the video offering. And then the recent addition of analytics to the package is helping. The commercial piece in North America growing a little bit faster even this year than the residential piece for us in terms of percentage growth and still is growing off a small base but is becoming increasingly relevant. So it will be a focus next year. And obviously, with the acquisition of OpenEye, we're increasing our focus in that domain and even moving a bit further up the food chain to what's called the enterprise space. The international itself is a driver and growing at a nice clip and I think probably will accelerate more next year than any year in the past. I feel like a lot of things are sort of about ready at the moment. And then we have the PointCentral business where I would think our – as a growth driver will be sort of steady state, next year continue to grow there. That team is moving into a couple of new segments. The biggest one being the multi-dwelling unit segment and I guess, I forgot EnergyHub is the other driver where – EnergyHub benefits from scale, the larger they become, the more relevant they become, the more utilities that are on the network. The more relevant they are to all the device makers. So that also is a growth driver for us. So those are kind of the key components of the picture that we look at. And we do a lot of bottom up modeling and then we do some top-down analysis on the segments and those are the segments that we're really focused on.
Nikolay Beliov: And my second question is about margins, EBITDA margins for 2020 in light of the investments. Steve, you talked about, I mean, should we model EBITDA flat margins next year or should we model EBITDA margins down. Can you give us some clear directional sense?
Steve Trundle: Yes, directionally. So I definitely wanted to cover that this quarter as we start thinking about next year. And I think the way I'm thinking about it, Nikolay is I'm thinking basically about where we are today. Good solid cash flow and I think solid EBITDA and I'm happy with the level we're at today. If I think about the contribution that would come from incremental growth, I start – so we do plan to grow next year that will generate some incremental contribution. And I think about basically accelerating some of our growth investments by plowing that incremental contribution back into the businesses is sort of the way I'm thinking about it.
Nikolay Beliov: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Hey, Steve, any sense of how much OpenEye impacted the quarter and then ultimately the rest of 2019?
Steve Trundle: So this is – Steve, you may correct me here. This is Steve Trundle. Had no impact on Q3 on the results we just reported because…
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, we closed it toward the end of October. This is Steve Valenzuela. So it didn't impact Q3 at all. And then in terms of how we looked at Q4, I think we've only sort of been in there for a couple of weeks. So modest – very, very modest impact on our model as we look at Q4 maybe a couple of million dollars were sprinkled in on the hardware and other side but not much. So really not much there. And then I think as Steve said, when we kind of think about the initial picture for 2020, we did model in some meaningful revenue from OpenEye on the hardware and other line into our 2020 initial look.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. And then obviously there, would you think of kind of the EBITDA impact, would that be reinvested as well or that would be kind of growth in 2020?
Steve Valenzuela: Good question. Yes. Currently sort of – it's a business that is well run and has been run to conserve cash. And in some ways that drives a focus on selling software licenses as opposed to selling fast because you get your cash upfront. So it's sort of a nice break-even business at the moment. I think the way we think about it is we would say it's probably little under capitalized and we would prefer to capitalize the business better. Try to accelerate the growth and try to accelerate a shift to an economic model that drives down the upfront cost for the service providers and/or the end customer by shifting some of the software costs into a SaaS model that's more reflective of the way Alarm.com works.  So the way we're looking at it is, while good healthy kind of could be a no impact type business where we're likely to accelerate investment into the business and would not be a massive headwind to EBITDA, but would be one of the things when I talked about, it’s not only some incremental profits back into the business, that would be one of the areas where I would expect to be plowing.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. And then just to finish it out, how should we think about this within the context of the STANLEY partnership earlier in the year and how has that been scaling on the commercial side?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, good question. I don't know that we've sort of matched those two initiatives just yet. I think in the case of OpenEye there, there are about 400 existing service providers and system integrators who are their partners. And there's very little overlap in that group. So the great thing is similar business model to us, but very little overlap in the actual established partnerships. And I honestly can't remember whether STANLEY is one or not. But what I would say is as we think about our service providers, we feel like and this is inclusive of all of them. We feel like the product that we're adding to our stack with OpenEye will be relevant particularly to those on the high end of the space. And you've identified one where they're needing to install in some cases a couple of hundred cameras on a given customer site. So that's where it's particularly relevant and there may be a fit there, but I don't think we've connected that just yet.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Gearhart with First Analysis.
David Gearhart: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to come back to OpenEye just briefly, a mix between hardware and license. Should we expect directionally a lift on the hardware and other gross margin side, as we go forward into Q4 and maybe in the next year?
Steve Trundle: Yes, good question. Steve, do you want to take that one?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, I think the gross margins for OpenEye for hardware are higher than our typical gross margins. So there would be a little bit of a lift in the overall gross margins for Alarm.com. But basically I think it's around 25% of what we're going to be taking from OpenEye or what's contributing there is software, which is pretty high margin revenue relative to what we see on typical hardware revenue. So their contribution would provide us a bit of a tailwind on the gross margins on the hardware and other line item because such a meaningful component of it is actually software.
Steve Trundle: That's right.
David Gearhart: Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to ask, Steve V, in terms of the tariff issue that's been talked about the last couple of quarters, what are you seeing on that front. And would you say directionally you're more positive on guidance or you're maintaining your expectations on the tariff front and in your current outlook?
Steve Valenzuela: We certainly have, as we've talked about in the past, we certainly have been incurring costs related to tariffs. We've been absorbing some of those. We've been able to pass some of that on. And so we still take a cautious view on tariff, we don’t know when the next tweet is going to come out, so we have to be careful. But I would say, we're just – we're being cautious when it comes to tariffs.
Steve Trundle: I would add a little color though, which is, it hasn't quite been the big event that maybe we expected it could be, there are material additional costs. We're incurring some of those costs, but does not seem to have affected demand. And I think that's probably because we and our service providers sort of figured out the right amount of these incremental costs that we should absorb and what sort of the right amount that the customer may be willing to absorb without materially altering demand. So, while they're still relevant and we look forward to them potentially going away, it hasn't really been the big event that I think maybe we were fearful of three, six months ago. 
David Gearhart: Okay. And then last for me, litigation expense, roughly $2 million, from the quarter down sequentially. Can you give us any sense of what we should expect, just in absolute dollars for litigation should we model flat for the next year on 2020? That's it for me. Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, it's a really hard to predict litigation expense as you said for Q3 it was $2 million down compared to $5 million Q3 2018 if you exclude the TCPA settlement. So it does kind of bump around at around a $3 million to $5 million per quarter level depending upon when the events concur. So it's always hard to predict when litigation matters come to the higher level of the case. But I would say if you look at in 2018, litigation expense was around $17 million not including the TCPA settlement. In 2017, it was $7 million. And then in 2016, it was around $14 million. So going forward, I think if you're modeling around the historical range around the $14 million to $17 million, but again, that's a caveat with, it's very hard to predict what cases will come forward. It's hard to predict when the costs will be incurred.
David Gearhart: Got it. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darren Aftahi with Roth Capital.
Darren Aftahi: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. A couple if I may. First, I guess for Steve Trundle. You talk about investments, why strategically is now the right time to kind of reinvest in all of these areas of the business you kind of mentioned?
Steve Trundle: Yes, I think it's, because we have tipped our toes in the water in a number of domains. I think, one being commercial, one being international. I can say the same thing about the HVAC segment. So, so in a few cases that an energy hub for that matter, we have, we have been kind of playing delicately and not fully committing, but I think you do that and you basically wait for the business to show you that it's worthy of being filled. And I think we're at a point now where we feel more confident that a number of these efforts are worthy of capital allocation and will drive positive results with some additional scale. So that's one thing. The second I would say is, I feel like we've gotten to a healthy level of cash production that allows us to be sort of forward leaning at with our Corp Dev activities and I don't want to go to the point that we're entirely driving growth with Corp Dev when we have so many great organic initiatives that are also worthy of capital allocation. So, I think we're at a nice point in terms of mix of cash production in of positive points with a number of these efforts. And therefore, I thought now is a good time to, I think we're not saying tomorrow by the way. We still have three, four months of this year to go through and then we'll really get into the details of planning out next year. But I felt like now is a good time for us to begin to think about how we're going to operate the business next couple of years in terms of the...
Steve Valenzuela: And I would add to that, we've built a very good balance sheet. We have strong – Steve talked about strong cash flows. And again, if you look at last year, for 2019, the EBITDA is I think – as I had around the guide is over a $100 million, over $102 million about which is a good amount of EBITDA. This year, if you exclude the TCPA payments, we're going to probably generate about $65 million of cash flow, which is very good amount of cash generation. So, I think we're at the point where we've got the business with good balance sheet, good cash flow generation and so the opportunity there is given all the opportunities with commercial, with video analytics, with international, EnergyHub and PointCentral all of those are really coming to the forefront of being ready for investment that we think will yield growth for the future.
Darren Aftahi: Great. That's helpful. A couple more if I may. Just with the integration of OpenEye, how do we think about your service provider base? I think in the past you've talked about I think it's well over a thousand and be  on your core commercial, but when you integrate these two platforms together, going into 2020, like it'd be a lot. How do we think about your service provider base vis-à-vis type commercial strategy?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So, I think that by early part of next year we will be providing a path for a set of service providers to become certified in the OpenEye solution as efficiently as possible and will enable those folks who service markets that are relevant to OpenEye to become OpenEye service providers. We'll make that easy for them. We'll do some integrations with various parts of our offering back into the OpenEye platform and vice versa. So we'll begin a couple things. There are some fairly low hanging fruit that we can go after initially in terms of simple integrations and then we'll get to work on probably the more sophisticated integrations on things like the video analytics piece. But so the nice thing is there's not a ton of overlap right now. I think there will be some service providers that we enable by the first quarter, second quarter assuming that they're interested and adding the OpenEye offering to their solution set. And that's kind of how we're thinking about it. The same time we think the business is good on its own and we want to avoid sort of interfering with the business or doing things that would cause it to change trajectory on where it is other than maybe what I discussed a moment ago where I talked about the value we see in driving down some of the upfront costs by shifting to a bit more of a SaaS model.
Darren Aftahi: That's helpful. Thank you. And then lastly, just what was the other SaaS revenue in the quarter?
Steve Valenzuela: It was $5 million up about 45% year-over-year for other SaaS, for the other segment.
Darren Aftahi: Great. Thank you guys.
Steve Trundle: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from you Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes, thanks. So this OpenEye acquisition is a pretty exciting, I think. And so a lot more questions on this first, was this a competitive process?
Steve Trundle: I'm sorry, what?
Steve Valenzuela: Was it a competitive process?
Steve Trundle: A competitive process? Yes, what I would say is that they had retained, they had a retained banking relationship that was exploring a few options. I think in terms of a strategic, we were the, we were sort of the only one that was invited to consider the situation. So yes, it was sourced. It wasn't, a big action but yes, so.
Nehal Chokshi: Understood. That's helpful. And then who would you consider OpenEye’s biggest competitor today?
Steve Trundle: There are a set of folks I want to avoid naming any single one but a set of fairly established traditional MDR players who deliver software and MDRs that normally sit onsite and allow you to monitor hundreds of cameras without really a lot of cloud apparatus included. So OpenEye already is a cloud oriented provider and that's really the big piece of differentiation is they allow you to manage the entire deployment through the cloud. If you want to share resources, you do that through the cloud. So it's already implemented as a hybrid cloud/on premise model. They've gravitated to more of an on premise traditional pricing scheme primarily because of the cash flow benefit that drives through a company that's self funded. But there are three or four large players that are in the traditional space. And then there are a handful of startups like OpenEye. I think on the destructor list OpenEye is probably the leader and there are a couple of others that are driving entirely cloud driven architectures. But I would say they'd probably have more traction than any of them.
Nehal Chokshi: Right. Are any of those established players Chinese vendors that have been recently put a place on the restricted list and maybe be creating some disruption that you guys can go and take advantage of?
Steve Trundle: Well, I think that – that dynamic creates some additional opportunity in that OpenEye is also is open, which means while they have eight to 10 of proprietary cameras that they offer, they support probably 12, 15 different partners who – when you go to a large commercial site, they don't want to be told that you need to replace all of the cameras they've installed over the last three or four years around the location so that you can run the OpenEye software. They want you to work with what's there. And that's driven the company to be fairly open and partner oriented, support a wide range of cameras, including a number who are not on any type of list or having, that may have any of those liabilities associated with them. So, that was another attractive element of this opportunity.
Nehal Chokshi: Got it. And then finally has the lack of the VMS or the VSaaS been an issue for driving the adoption of Alarm’s other commercial offerings?
Steve Trundle: I would say that not entirely, because we have not gone after the segments that they're focused on. So we've probably, we're working within a small, slightly smaller TAM than what is conceivable with the OpenEye solution. And in our case, a typical installation will be anywhere from two to 30 cameras. And the way the video is on the commercial side is consumed is normally through an iPad or an iPhone or some other mobile device.  In their case, a typical installation could be hundreds of cameras that all need to be managed through a similar or through a single software stack. And the majority of it will be consumed by a person that's sitting in a guard station, with 30 or 40 different cameras alternating in the proprietary user interface. So, that part of the market that they serve, customers like Gonzaga University or Olive Garden, some of these large sort of distributed players, Bed Bath & Beyond that's a segment that we haven't really targeted with our commercial offering today. And therefore, I wouldn't say we've been hindered, but now we have an opportunity through OpenEye to target more of that segment.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I will now hand the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, David Trone.
David Trone:
Steve Trundle: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone. We are pleased to report that fourth quarter results were above our expectations. Our SaaS and license revenue in the fourth quarter was $90.1 million, up 15.7% over last year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $30 million. Our fourth quarter results helped close out a strong 2019 with annual revenue exceeding $0.5 billion for the first time in our company's history. I want to thank our service provider partners, our ecosystem partners, and our employees who enabled us to achieve this revenue milestone. Today, more than 9,000 service providers sell and service our technology to their customers in more than 6.8 million properties in over 40 countries around the world. Alarm.com manages more than 100 million connected devices and sensors through our cloud services. On our last call at the end of Q3, I spoke about our increasing confidence in several growth areas as well as our intent to step up our level of organic investment to more fully capitalize on the opportunities we see. That process is underway. On today's call, I will review some of the elements of our strategy in 2020 and touch upon the growth areas where we are investing. First, we are working hard to extend our position as the most innovative platform provider for service provider businesses that want to capitalize on the wide set of emerging IoT-driven monitoring applications. This requires that we continue to build the scale across our technology stack and operations. We are aiming to fully address opportunities across the single-family and multifamily residential markets, the small business market, and the enterprise commercial market. For each property type, we are aiming to provide fully integrated, fully supported best-in-class applications in the areas of security, automation, energy management, water management and health. And we will deliver these applications across geographies and languages, such that, we can drive growth in both our North American and international businesses.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results and then provide guidance for 2020 before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the fourth quarter grew 15.7% from the same quarter last year to $90.1 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $10.6 million for the fourth quarter, down from $10.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The drop in Connect license revenue is expected as our customer who we licensed the Connect software too is focused on rolling out their new platform on Alarm.com SaaS software that we operated host for the service provider.
Operator: Thank you.  And our first question is from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.
Jacqueline Cheong: Hi, this is Jacqueline Cheong on for Nikolay. Thanks for taking the question. Can you please double-click on how commercial is doing and the progress there? And when would we expect it to kind of ramp up and hit some sort of inflection point?
Steve Trundle: Sure Jacqueline. This is Steve speaking. So, yes, commercial is doing pretty well. We -- it grew at an accelerated pace last year. We obviously made the OpenEye acquisition to further strengthen our commercial story and particularly, strengthen our story in the enterprise market. So, when was -- when is it going to be sort of a real down move, I'd say it's already positively impacting our business. And as we build the base of service providers who promote install of a commercial offering, we should see it continue to accelerate. I would say we're at roughly 10% of service providers right now are trained and marketing the offering in the commercial space and we expect that number to continue to grow.
Jacqueline Cheong: Got it. Thank you. And could you talk about like what training is required? And how -- why aren't we seeing more sort of providers trained on the commercial platform?
Steve Trundle: Well, first, just keep in mind, sheer numbers. So, with 9,000 service providers when they say 10%, that means that in a relatively short period of time, 900 have come up and are actively beginning to solve the offering. Second is a lot of them are busy in the residential space. If you're a service provider, you have to make a decision do I want to stay focused on the business that's good in the residential space or I wanted to begin to divert resources into the commercial space quite a few have a preference for sort of saying where they're strong and focusing on the residential space. And that's fine with us. That's a great market. But with the improvements to the offering we're continuing to recruit more service providers that already have a history of competing in the commercial enterprise space. And in terms of training, it's a lot of block and tackle execution. It's trading on everything from how to install door strikes to how to price, how to sell, it really depends on the experience of the service provider with -- or in the commercial space already how much of that training is actually necessary. But with our products, we do take a service provider through a certification process.
Jacqueline Cheong: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And if I could just put in one more. Just also wanted to hear about how international is doing? It sounds like we're seeing a little bit of a ramp, but when do we expect an inflection in this segment as well?
Steve Trundle: Yes. So I think we're definitely seeing a ramp. Our service providers internationally are executed well in 2019 I would say and some of the investments we have made in prior years. I think in prior years people have asked well how long does it take? What do you have to do? What are the steps? And I sort of went into a refrain of similar types of things. You have to train you have to get your pricing set. You have to make sure all the ecosystem products are working for a given market. A lot of that came together in 2019 and we saw enough service providers really succeeding on the execution side that we gain confidence in that part of the business partially in the back half of the year. And we expect rough numbers we ended the year with well over to -- or very close to or over 200,000 non-North American subscribers and we're seeing an acceleration of kind of installed rate. So, I don't know what we necessarily characterize as an inflection, but we see good solid momentum there and that's one of the drivers for why we are going to continue to step up our efforts to cater to the international markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Adam Tindle: Okay. Thanks and good afternoon. I just wanted to start with the 2020 guidance, the SaaS and license revenue growth initial guidance is quite healthy at mid-13% year-over-year range. I think that's just about the same percentage growth that you started guiding 2019, obviously, ultimately exceeded it. But now you're starting off a bigger base. So, I'm just hoping for maybe some thoughts around key drivers as you build that 2020 satellites initial guidance a lot of confidence to start out with a similar percentage growth target at 2019 and it looks like that's going to progress as the year moves on because Q1 is going to start slightly below that year-over-year growth. So, why does it accelerate as the year progresses?
Steve Trundle: Sure. I'll take that initial lack of that Adam. And first, you're pretty perceptive if we talk about and look at history. So, yes, we felt some things coming together at the back half of 2019. We've talked about increasing contribution from a number of the growth areas of the business. And then we saw strength. And our North American service provider channel as well in parts of it. So we -- our model, and the way we do guidance is really more of a budgeting process where it's bottom-up and we look at current trajectories and then we model off of that and we treated as a budget that we intend to hit. So when we see some of the results coming in and we see growth and international growth in some of the segment businesses, the North American business doing well growth in commercial, I think even on the bigger base, because some of these things are beginning to create a more material contribution, we felt comfortable with the guide that on a percentage basis was similar to what we did this time last year.
Adam Tindle: Okay. And the acceleration as the year progresses is something that happens in the back half of the year that maybe…?
Steve Trundle: Yeah. There's a little bit of -- yeah. I mean, Q1 always I think is a little seasonally weak quarter at some levels. I mean not dramatically weak, just slightly weak. And yes, I think obviously to get to our kind of goal through the end of the year we have to have outperformance in the back half of the year or what you would call accelerated performance. So yes, that's what we -- that's what we're currently modeling.
Adam Tindle: Okay. That's helpful. And I just have a kind of a bigger picture follow-up Steve on investments. And I'll acknowledge that that maybe this is somewhat unfair, because it's predicated on prior success of the business, but bear with me. You've talked about the payback period on recurring revenue, how healthy that's been, may be we've been able to take prior year sales and marketing add it to prior year SaaS and license revenue and usually get a proxy for where forward your SaaS revenue should be at a minimum. Now that we're done with 2019, I think this was the first year where that payback period model extended beyond that one year. And if we look at 2020 guidance, it implies that payback period extends a little bit further. So the question is maybe first just tackle why the payback period has elongated? And then how do you weigh the investment opportunities given the core business is not saturated? What are the key metrics that you're focused on on these investment decisions?
Steve Trundle: Yeah. Starting with the -- starting with sales and marketing payback period. I would say as a more meaningful chunk of the business is tied to less mature initiatives earlier state initiatives, the upfront sort of sales and marketing expense really required to prime the pump that is higher on a relative basis than it would be in a more mature segment. So if we take a segment like international, we're going to work really hard to bring on a service provider in a given country that in the first few months after that relationship's consummated might create five or 10 actual subscribers for us. And clearly that doesn't justify the sales and marketing spend on an annual basis anyway. The reason we do it, of course, is we hope to have a decades long relationship. But as you're trying to set up a number of these relationships that hopefully will be decades long, you do have some increased burden on the sales and marketing side. And I think that's what we're seeing when we look at both -- some of there earlier stage segment businesses. Particularly I think last year or at the end of third quarter, I talked about wanting to actually intentionally step up investment and some of the organic growth initiatives in the segment businesses. Based on what we saw there that requires building out a bigger sales team and we have the confidence now that demand or native demand is likely there that the product in different cases is ready and it's time to prime the pump with some increased sales and marketing energy. So I'd say that's why in aggregate you see that. I don't think we want to pull back from being thorough in servicing our more traditional North American partners either they -- while we may not be selling a ton of new business to a given service provider in North America, we still have growth there with additional offerings in video and commercial, and we want to make sure at some point sales moves from sort of sales to service. And as a partner kind of continues their legacy with us, we want to make sure, we're keeping in place a meaningful service component and helping them continue to grow their business. So you get somewhat more efficient as the base build in a mature business, but you don't want to drop the service component. And then the new businesses require some upfront energy, I think that's why that payback -- that cap ratio is elongating a bit.
Adam Tindle: Understood. That's helpful…
Steve Valenzuela: Adam, this is Steve Valenzuela. I would add too with OpenEye acquisition, we're going to be investing in their sales team. If you look at the opportunity for the enterprise, you've got a $4 billion market. And as a private company, they were really constrained in terms of the number of salespeople. And given that that sale is an enterprise sale, we are going to be adding a number of additional salespeople to the OpenEye team that does increase the sales and marketing expense a bit. But still looking at other companies, if you look at our sales and marketing spending as a percent of revenues around 13% for 2019, maybe up 100 basis points for 2020, but it's still relatively low when you compare to other companies out there. So we feel very good about our investment in sales and marketing.
Adam Tindle: Definitely. Thanks, Steve.
Steve Valenzuela: Yep. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Matt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the video analytics products. You mentioned that there's several large – larger partners that are going to market with video analytics in 2020. How come it took these partners over a year I guess to start to offer the product? And then as you look across your base, what percentage of partners that could offer video analytics are doing so currently?
Steve Trundle: Yes. Let me start with the second question which is what percentage of partners that could offer analytics are doing so. My guess is – this is a guess that it's just when looking at sales reports and whatnot is that number is actually probably pretty high at this point. I'd say 60% plus are in the – our offering analytics with the video solution. And the reason for that is it's just such a better customer experience and everyone is focused on delivering a world-class customer experience to the consumer. With the larger entities some have already moved some have not. And a year is actually not that out right? Just when you think about the – if you're a large enterprise again when you think about reconditioning the way that salespeople in the field sell, the way that technicians are trained to do installations those sorts of things. It just takes some time to work through that deployment plan. And also at times takes a little bit of effort to work things out with us on the cost and those type of things. So we've – I think we've cleared most of those hurdles at this point. And therefore that we're able to comment that we expect to see that trend continue.
Matt Pfau: Got it. And as you increase the breadth of the offering and get more complex something in things like video and the Smart Water Valve, the associated installations also become more complex. So how do you work with your partners to incentivize them to sell those more complex deployments? And then also make sure that they're done properly so that it doesn't end up reflecting poorly on your end?
Steve Trundle: Right. Now that's a excellent question and that's something we have to focus on with training and support. The first is making sure that you're – we're very proud of our support team. So making – and the reason for that is if you're one of our partners and you're attempting to sort of enter the market with a new IoT-type of product, you have to feel confident as the supplier you're working with is going to support you effectively. So the first thing is making sure that we have great support resources in place. That's everything from e-mail and telephone support to training to knowledge-based articles those types of things. That's not really an incentive. It's just 10  states something you have to do but it's hard to do well. Second is the market is creating in terms of incentives that customers is increasingly asking for capabilities like this. And all of our service providers are I think focused on delivering the most value they possibly can to the consumer. So there's a little bit of a market base there if you will where in order to add more customers and remain relevant to a wider segment of the TAM, you need to expand the universe of ecosystem devices that you support. And water is a good example. It will be a hard one. It will be a hard one because it involves plumbing as part of the installation. And what we'll do is work to create the right network of third-party providers who can come into a home or a small business and make adjustments to the plumbing apparatus. And the value though to an insurance company to the homeowner if you actually look at loss is immense. And the value to a consumer just sort of the peace of mind of knowing that they have leaks or don't is pretty high as well. So we think the market will demand. If we'll figure out how to execute on the actual delivery of the product. But it's a good question because it is one of the reasons why sometimes we announced something and then a year later we're in 50% or 60% in terms of installs that could be deployed to the technology.
Matt Pfau: Great. That’s all I have for you guys. Thanks and nice for the rest of the year.
Steve Trundle: Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Gearhart with First Analysis. Please go ahead.
David Gearhart: Thanks. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. In prior quarters you had talked about some of your large dealers having difficulty getting significant or sufficient credit to buy accounts. Just wondering if you could give us an update on that front and activity around those large dealers in regards to that issue?
Steve Trundle: Sure. David I'll take that one. The market for us has three segments they're sort of very large, well capitalized players. They are smaller, very local service providers. Those two segments are both in fine shape right now. And there's a third sort of chunk which is large players who are -- who have through the years become dependent on a handful of lenders, and we've seen some softness in that lending community that persists today. So, it's still an issue that folks are working through. I think the issue is that that credit is not as widely available to the service provider in a certain category today as it was a year ago. And the issue hasn't yet gone away. Do I think it will go away? Yes. I think we'll see a trickle deals a trickle of additional entrance. The terms on -- at some point, as the markets evolve and terms on debt deals evolve, and at some point the deals become so attractive that a lender wants to participate. And I think that's kind of where we are right now is probably at a point where we're just beginning to see some participants that are looking more anxiously at the opportunity to land into this segment out of chain.
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah. I would add that there are a couple of lenders that we've heard of recently that see it as an opportunity. They are starting to take a look, and think that there's a good opportunity for them in the business. And whereas in the past, they may not have looked at this area, but there are a few that are starting to see that that it is a good opportunity.
David Gearhart: Okay. And then lastly for me, you mentioned coronavirus in your prepared remarks, and I wanted to touch on that briefly. One of your peers, maybe less so on the do it yourself space with the scale, announced their results yesterday, and they talked a bit about having difficulty getting components, and it's making it hard to actually build products. So, I'm just wondering are you not facing that at this time? And the related question is do you have enough safety stock of components on hand? And what kind of runway do you think that gives you?
Steve Trundle: Yeah. So, we're all watching the news probably with more interest than normally. And at this juncture, obviously, we have to make an estimate for the year based on what we know today. And we have accommodated a certain amount of challenge in our supply chain with the estimates we've provided for the year. We haven't accommodated the absolute worst-case scenario. But that's partially, because I don't think we're going to have the absolute worst-case scenario. If we -- while -- if we look at what's actually going on with factories, I think most who are reporting at factories are gradually coming back online in terms of our suppliers. That's true. We say we look at a percentage of capacity that's now back online, and it's not increasing as quickly as we have liked, but it is increasing. Do we have an infinite supply on hand? No, we don't. So, I expect at some point, we'll see some factors come back online, we'll be okay. We'll see a few products where we'll have some execution challenges. We'll have to manage those, and we'll scramble accordingly. But based on what we see today, I'm I guess hopeful that we'll see this thing gradually in the supply chain anyway work itself out.
David Gearhart: Okay. Thanks for the color. That’s it for me.
Steve Trundle: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Go ahead please.
Nehal Chokshi: Yeah. Thank you and good results. I have two questions. First is that within that great SaaS and license revenue growth that you saw, it was acceleration. Were there any one-time license related revenue behind that?
Steve Trundle: So, for the full year of 2019?
Nehal Chokshi: 4Q, 2019.
Steve Valenzuela: Fourth quarter.
Steve Trundle: Oh, for four -- Q4 one-time. There's always a tad of seasonality in the number in the fourth quarter when we get some value out of our energy contracts that are dependent on how those contracts performed during the year. And those are -- those can be challenging to replicate over and over again. You may get the next year, you may not. You just don't know. And so, we had some strength there, I would say, in the fourth quarter, in particular we also have a bit of strength in various types of performance incentives that whether they be energy-related or related to reliability of our services that came in slightly positive. So, there was probably a small component of the Q4 SaaS number that was not necessarily repeating, I would say. But -- and that's probably why if we look at the Q1 guide, Q-over-Q it looks on a relative basis a little smaller and that kind of captures some of what that volatility was.
Nehal Chokshi: Okay, great. And you've talked a lot about video on the call, and adoption by your customers that's now at 35% in new accounts for calendar 2019. And you expected that positive trend to continue. Were you basically trying to say that the attach rate to new accounts is going to go up? Or you are expecting that to stay flat? And has that been the driver of what I calculate to be a second year in a row of 8% ARPU increase?
Steve Valenzuela: Yeah. So, I think what did I mean by the confidence that the trend will continue. I do think that we'll continue to see an increase in the percentage of new installations that have video attached. I'm not sure where the endpoint is, it may be 50%. I don't know if we'll get there this year, but I think we'll continue to see an upward trajectory there particularly in the second half of the year. So we would hope to provide an even higher attach rate data point towards the end of the year. In terms of how that translates to ARPU, obviously selling more services is better. At the same time, we have to be mindful of making sure we're providing reasonable value to the service providers. So we'll hopefully see some benefit there, but we're not going to -- we're not going to use it primarily as -- we're not going to get overly jealous about preserving or gaining our massive ARPU growth out of the service. We want to provide a great service to the customer and make sure that we're protecting the value we already provide.
Nehal Chokshi: Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Aftahi with Roth Capital Partner.
Darren Aftahi: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice result. I heard that 9000 is service provider number. Did I hear the ending subscriber account you had at the end of 2019?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. We said that was that 6.8 million subscribers.
Darren Aftahi: Fantastic. So maybe I could kind of follow-on to last question. So it looks like in the fourth quarter that the core SaaS at least what we call -- that opened that comps that kind of reaccelerated and is more in line with kind of first half of the year kind of level that didn't look like comps were really any easier last year. So I'm just curious if there's anything you would call out in that reacceleration? And as part of that commercial international, Steve it sounds like some of your commentary is directionally kind of positive there. But anything you can kind of call there would be helpful? Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. I think as Steve said, there is some seasonality in the fourth quarter with the energy programs we get the benefit as a taxes utility savings, energy savings that typically record in the fourth quarter and those were positive. But I would say too that we did see growth in international starting to contribute in the fourth quarter. It's not a huge number, but it did take a little bit of a stair-step up in the fourth quarter as we saw a number of the new international dealers online. I think commercial also is contributing. I think video analytics is contributing and video plans as we talked about before video certainly adds not only the hardware that comes along with video but also the ARPU related to video. So I think those are all positive elements that contributed to the fourth quarter performance.
Darren Aftahi: Great. And then on your commentary around video services uptake on new customers, I think you said 35%. I'm just kind of curious a while back it may have been at your ISE Investor Day you kind of talked about increasing kind training for the service providers. I'm curious attach rates on video for existing subs where your service provider base is going back and then up selling those services? What kind of the attach rate you've seeing maybe on a trailing basis? Thank you.
Steve Trundle: We're definitely doing that. In terms of the -- what I can tell you one data point, I do have that I'll share is about 18% of our actual video camera cells, I believe in the fourth quarter went back to the base. So that's coming from either our service providers going out and upgrading existing customers to get them to a level of device capable of supporting video analytics or it's going into customers, who simply don't have video attached to their home or business. So it's definitely a part of our strategy as to continue to go back into the base and penetrate. I don't have the number handy for exactly what the base penetration is but...
Darren Aftahi: Great. And then just last one for me. I think on the last call, you talked about $540 million to $550 million through revenue guidance, it's about $7.5 million better this time around. I'm just curious can you segment out what the numbers were so? I'm kind of curious what that $7.5 million is skewed towards is SaaS or hardware? Thanks.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. Actually it's Steve Valenzuela. So we took up the SaaS guide by about $7 million so most of that increase is SaaS, But we've never actually given a guide on it, but I think we took it above $7 million above.
Steve Trundle: Yes. Other factors exactly.
Steve Valenzuela: But if you look at our hardware number, it's really not elevated at all relative to 2019 and if you include the OpenEye component. So that's where most of the gain there versus our initial outlook is coming from.
Steve Trundle: That's right.
Darren Aftahi: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets.
Mike Latimore: Great, thanks. Congratulations on the quarter. Can you provide a little more color on international? And maybe how many service providers are sort of on-boarded now versus a year ago? And are there any particular countries that are sort of the most fruitful going forward here?
Steve Trundle: See, a little more color. I don't have the number of service providers in front of me. But I'd say, the main thing we're watching is the recently how many accounts per week or per month are you actually installing. We saw that move in the back half of the year well above 10,000 a month that gave us confidence that we would see increased growth in 2020 in the international segment. The markets that are good, it's actually almost every market we're in. So Latin America has shown nice strength in the last six months. Europe, I feel like we're beginning to get some momentum there with a couple of different service providers. So some strength there. Australia has been strong for a long time, continues to be strong. Turkey is a market that has been strong for a long time, continues to be strong. So, most places where we're participating, we feel some momentum on the international side. I think, I noted we're in about 40 countries now with good service provider relationships. And those are all in different stages. But, in general, we're not really painting a place where we're sort of running in the failure at the moment. If we're running in the failure, it's usually things that we can solve. Fix the product, get the right devices supported, get the right support apparatus in place. And those are the type of problems we'd like to encounter, because they're solvable. And that's kind of what we're seeing.
Mike Latimore: Right. And then, I got -- I'm interpreting that you're a little more confident in the North American residential market, I guess, one, is that true right now? And then, two, is that tied largely to this credit dynamic improving or something else?
Steve Valenzuela: I think it's just the -- based on the production and the delivery of the service providers, in 2019, was we thought solid. There's been a lot of concern and noise about an impact coming from various places on the service provider. But if we look at the -- on the whole, performance of the North American Residential segment, it was pretty good. So, I think, that's probably on the debt market thing. It's not a part of the market where we're an active participant. So we're an outsider looking in, but from my discussions with various partners, I have a belief that it will gradually work itself. And all these new entrants come in. And as that firms up then that -- what I'm hearing is, I don't have a business problem. What I have is a balance sheet problem at the moment. I need to roll that over, et cetera and we have fewer participants. So as the participants come in, if the business is solid, I think, we'll see that rectify itself.
Mike Latimore: Okay, great. Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Sure. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you so much. Our last question is from Jeff Kessler with Imperial. Please go ahead.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. As you -- as we look at the worldwide security industry, I'm looking at your larger security providers and looking at secondly your acquisition of OpenEye, who deals with enterprise sized installers or the world of commercial dealers and the world of installers is beginning kind of morph together. So how are you interpreting this in terms of going to your larger dealers, who may be doing both commercial and resi and dealing with the integrators who basically are just all commercial and getting them -- those folks to get on the same -- I'm talking about the -- on the commercial side, getting them all on the same page. Those commercial dealers and those integrators to start taking on your products, so that, if you want to call it the sales channel, begins to even out for you and you begin to get a common message across to both of those groups to accelerate your commercial business and the enterprise business at the same time?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. So there's a couple of parts to that question Jeff. First, I think, you're absolutely right that the system integrator component of the channel is sort of converging with the commercial dealer part of the channel. The integrator is moving into more recurring revenue oriented types of business models and the commercial dealer is moving up into the enterprise space zone. So that process is underway. We want to make sure we have the right product there. And for us, the focus is really on being -- it's not the first, the best that a fully integrated enterprise-grade solution that incorporates access, video, intrusion and in some cases energy management. If that all works together nicely and the presentation of that functionality to the user is exceptional, then we think we'll have the right product there and we'll continue to make inroads. As we look at the service providers who are more residentially focused, if you actually ask them what their biggest challenge is, the biggest challenge I usually hear is that, I can't hire enough technicians. I'm constrained from an HR perspective, especially in the current economy. And against that backdrop, it's sometimes hard to get a person to say, hey, when I'm already under resourced and I'm struggling to hire enough technicians to install on the demand, I see right in front of me, sometimes it's difficult to get that person to also want to leap into a new market. So I think it's a type of thing where you sort of chip away. You hope that, they're able to scale up their HR functions, hire more technicians, meet the demand on the residential side, cancelations and as they do that they become more successful. They maybe gain more capacity to invest and invest in the higher state that are focused on referral space and then gradually built that out. We don't need everyone to be – we don't need or really want everyone who's strong in residential to move to commercial. So we just want to make sure that for those service providers that are doing both that we've got the right platform that allows them to kind of move across the entire potential market that's addressable to them.
Jeff Kessler: All right. Thank you. Last question. At this time last year, you talked about investing – spending some time in 2019 investing some more – investing some reinvesting more into your business which was kind of like I'm not saying, it was a adoptive or so, but it was kind of like a call that's saying we better watch out for what your EBITDA would be with some of the – with some of the numbers below the revenue line were going to be and you did invest more heavily in the business. Where did things go right so that those help more – those have increased investment in your business did not basically ended up with numbers that were particularly higher than what most analysts were thinking about at the beginning of the year?
Steve Valenzuela: Right. A question of whether it went right. So you're talking about the EBITDA number being higher and the reason is – 
Jeff Kessler: Yeah. I'm talking about the fact that you said that you were going to spend this year investing fairly heavily in the business that is kind of at the kind of code for the fact that expenses would be higher investments would be higher R&D would be higher. And it was – and you became more optimistic throughout the year with regard to how your revenues were reacting to those investments. What was the cause of that?
Steve Valenzuela: Well, I guess, I would say that, the cause was in perfect execution on the recruiting front at Alarm.com. So we intended and markets are tough on the recruiting front. We intended to scale up last year, our R&D function even faster than we did. And so when you have slightly fewer employees than you expected then you end up with a higher EBITDA number, particularly when that's compounded by growth that was better than we expected on the – on the top line. So we had better top line growth, higher hardware sales. We didn't quite hire as many people as we wanted to in 2019. Next towards the end of the year as we roll into 2020, we acquired OpenEye I think we commented we intend to invest in that business and build it out. So a lot of the reasons you just articulated in your question on the commercial space, build out our presence there. So in that case, we're taking a business that is going to contribute I think we've indicated $40 million. And top line, we've indicated we're definitely not run that at sort of the company's EBITDA margin level. We're probably going to run it for a while in an investment mode and a loss. So that was one of the reasons, I think towards the end of last year, I communicated that as we go into 2020, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital and growth initiatives both organic and in some cases resulting from acquisition.
Jeff Kessler: Will OpenEye eventually have a cloud? Will eventually OpenEye have a cloud platform?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. They already do actually. And the cloud is getting richer by the day.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you very much for taking our question.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Steve Trundle: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A and program for today. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.";[0.057232313871895535, 0.0828204386212874];0.0828204386212874;0.057232313871895535;0
60;ALRM;2020-05-09;"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Alarm.com's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Trone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead sir.
David Trone: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alarm.com's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Joining us today from Alarm.com are Steve Trundle, President and CEO; and Steve Valenzuela, CFO, each from their separate offices as we are following social distancing practices.
Stephen Trundle: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone. We're pleased to report solid Q1 results to start off the year. Our SaaS and license revenue in the first quarter was $91.9 million, up 14.9% over last year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $29.2 million. I want to thank our service providers and the Alarm.com team for their contributions to our results and for their ongoing performance during these challenging times. We carried significant momentum from last year into the first quarter. During most of the quarter, the market continued be very healthy for us on a number of dimensions, including commercial, video, energy management and international. This momentum, along with confident execution, led to solid financial results. In the first quarter, we had a record level of hardware sales that were driven by subscribers continuing to add video to their smart home systems at an increasing rate, with many also choosing to further enhance their system with our AI-enabled video analytics capabilities. Our R&D program also continued to deploy new technology in key areas throughout the quarter. We introduced a series of capabilities to both simplify and enhance the experience for more sophisticated subscribers with more advanced systems. We made it easier for video analytics subscribers to discover and share video clips of important activity from the Alarm.com mobile app. We introduced our seen feature to our Apple Watch app to make controlling multiple automation devices more convenient. We also expanded our upsell engine and launched a new portal that makes it easier to upgrade existing systems with self-installed devices. On the Alarm.com for Business platform, we launched a commercial-grade strain video recorder, which gives our service providers a competitive and differentiated solution for supporting larger video installations in the SMB market. We also launched video health reports for commercial video customers, which provides a monthly update on the condition of video cameras and stream video recorders. This ensures continuous, uninterrupted video coverage. During the quarter, we also worked hard to begin onboarding some large new international partners, and our subsidiaries continue to build their product offerings and market opportunities. Our subsidiary PointCentral successfully acquired Door Fort which is an innovative start-up that provides a software-based access control solution for multifamily dwellings.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve. I will begin with a review of our strong first quarter 2020 financial results and then discuss guidance before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the first quarter grew 14.9% from the same quarter last year to $91.9 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $9.7 million for the Connect software which is now primarily deploying a new platform that is powered by the Alarm.com SaaS software that we operate and host for the service provider.
Operator:  I show our first question comes from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Adam Tindle: Okay, thanks, good afternoon. I just wanted to start, Steve, on guidance for SaaS and license revenue for fiscal 2020. Essentially unchanged which is quite impressive. If you could maybe just talk us through some of the metrics that gave you confidence to reinforce that? And I guess, more specifically, looking for obviously, gross adds are likely going to be challenged, but ballpark of kind of how much or what you're seeing, churn trends, retention rate declined modestly, still very healthy, but decelerated a little bit, so any assumptions there and ARPU trends. So gross adds, churn and ARPU would helpful in thinking about the full year guidance?
Stephen Trundle: Sure. This is Steve Trundle. And Steve, you can chip in if there's something I missed. Yes, we looked at things pretty carefully. I think we're very fortunate that a lot of our service providers are just very entrepreneurial, and they have adjusted practices some, so they're continuing to do business. In most cases, it really depends some on the area of the country or the area of the world. In my prepared remarks, I noted that currently, we were off in terms of gross new creations relative to what's normal. We were at about 70%. And I indicated that within the last couple of weeks, we've seen that what we think or what we hope is a bottom and a slow trend line back up. So we were careful to note this is a tough quarter to guide. And we were careful to note a few of our assumptions in guiding. The biggest one being that we see a trend line as the year progresses, steadily upwards to the point that, in the fourth quarter, we're at around 95% of normal in terms of gross creations, and that's an important trend at. Steve noted that revenue retention is sort of right where it's always been, right, in the normal range of 92% to 94%. So we haven't seen any changes there, no changes really on ARPU. And then we benefited a little bit from a strong first two months of the year where, coming in January and February, things were probably a little hotter than we expected, and that gave us a little bit of a push that allowed us to get comfortable with something close to the prior guide.
Steve Valenzuela: Adam, Steve Valenzuela. The revenue retention I talked about, going from 94% to 93%, that's really rounding because it's only 20 basis points. So it's very minor and really had nothing to do with COVID. It's just more of a mathematical rounding down versus rounding up.
Adam Tindle: Yes, makes sense. Steve, if I could just do one follow-up. Obviously, you had healthy cash generation in the quarter. You're coming from a strong cash position into this, which is nice. Maybe can just talk about how you're thinking about potential impact to Alarm.com from a cash standpoint as the dealer base goes through this challenging period that Steve mentioned. Any considerations that we should think about from a cash generation standpoint?
Steve Valenzuela: Well, we have a good cash flow generation model. And in fact, in Q1, typically, Q1 is a cash usage quarter because that's when we pay the company bonuses, typically timing wise. But this last quarter, we saw a very good cash generation, free cash flow of about $9 million. And if you look at last year, we entered about $50 million of free cash flow. Based on our models for the year, we were projecting around $40 million to $50 million of free cash flow for this year, and we still feel that that's still a number. It might be a little bit less. If you look at our DSOs, for example, in Q1, the DSOs actually held flat to Q4 at about 49 days. Now we will see that tick up a little bit, and we factored it into our models. And some of the dealers have taken a little bit longer to pay, which is understandable given the circumstances. But we have over 90% of our receivables current or within 30 days of the due date. So we actually have a very good accounts receivable process, very good DSOs, very good cash flow generation engine. And the $50 million we pulled down really was at the beginning of the pandemic, if you will, and the lockdown. And I went through 2008, where liquidity is dried up, and I talked to our banking syndicate, and they said, ""Hey, by the way, all of our clients are pulling down their revolvers as much as they can."" We decided to pull down $50 million. Again, we don't intend to use that and we don't intend to need that for operating purposes, but it's good in this kind of environment, cash is king, so to speak, and there will be some good opportunity out there to deploy our cash at some point perhaps. But in the meantime, the cost of that capital was very low. We have a revolver that doesn't expire until October 2022. So it made a lot of sense.
Adam Tindle: Thank you for the color.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Nikolay Beliov: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I hope everybody is safe and healthy. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the guide question for Steve Valenzuela. Steve, I mean if net new business is down 30% and still going to be down minus 5%, minus 10% as the year progresses, but thematically, you would think that the guide should be down. I don't want to be that blunt, but I mean, I'm just trying to understand what's helping out the guide. Is it international? Is it commercial, the other businesses that gives you comfort to maintain the guide and not to take the opportunity, frankly, to might as well lower the guide?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, Nikolay. Hope your family and everyone is safe, for everybody on the call as well. This is definitely a challenging time. But I would say that we started the year, we came in better on Q1. So we have a launch pad, if you will, for subscription we're coming off of, which is significantly fairly significantly above what we were expecting. And so we've actually modeled the improvement occurring over the year to the point where Steve said, by the end of the year, we'll be at about 95% in terms of the activations. The retention has really maintained where it has been prior to pre-COVID-19. And so in our modeling, which is we've gone through that, we feel comfortable with the guide.
Nikolay Beliov: Got it. And on the underneath the covers., I mean, can you expect stack rank for us please. The relative growth rate between international, commercial, U.S. residential, the other businesses, can you give us more color on the relative growth rates across the businesses please?
Steve Valenzuela: So the commercial has been well, we don't update that every quarter, but commercial has been running at about 40% growth rate. International has been running a little bit better than that. That's the last time we updated. But again, it's something we're not going to necessarily update every quarter. We continue to see good growth in Q1 in commercial and in international.
Stephen Trundle: I was just going to add, yes, that's what we are seeing in the first quarter. I'd say, as I noted, we're seeing differences in geography that are pretty dramatic in terms of where the market is still performing and where it's not. And the U.S. is granted, the majority of our business is U.S., but the U.S. is much more operational than our rest-of-world markets right now. So whatever we define as a shutdown is less than what a shutdown is in Europe and Latin America. So that International will not that model this year, I don't think.
Nikolay Beliov: Got it. And Steve, my last question is, do you think there's going to be a permanent change in the way your service providers deliver the product? Is there going to be more shift toward DIY. Do you feel like as a technology to card, you need to maybe modify and make the installation simpler to the point where it can be shipped to the customer and DIY fashion can be installed easier and removing potentially as the pandemic on your business, you're simplifying installation from both product perspective and logistical perspective.
Stephen Trundle: Yes, it's a good question. We saw some of that. So we have a mix of DIY service providers in the partner base, obviously. I would say that they probably saw a modest uptick in the COVID period, and we also saw a number of service providers implement, at least temporarily, a modified fulfillment methodology where the first thing they do is ship to customer our product in a self-installation kit and let the customer protect the property on an interim basis until the customer is comfortable with the technician coming to the house. And if you've stickers up on your door and you want it to look polished, eventually, you're more than likely going to want a service provider to come and really do a bang-up job, get all the outdoor cameras mounted correctly, get the thermostat install correctly, get all those things done well. But if you need immediate protection, a number of our service providers did implement, what I would call, probably interim DIY fulfillment mechanisms to bridge the gap, especially during the beginning of the pandemic. And then as this went on, a number of them got comfortable with procedures, and I think the consumer got comfortable with the set of procedures where they're doing all the right things in terms of checking the occupants of a property or business for any health conditions, making sure they're going in with a proper PPE, well scheduled, eliminating human contact, all those types of things. So the business began to recover on that. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we did roll out I noted this specifically, a way for the consumer to add to their system new devices more easily than has been the case in the past. So we added an entire sort of add device portal that allows you if you are a service provider and someone wants to add, for example, a doorbell camera and they want to add a thermostat or whatever it may be to the system device, we now can let the dealer ship that to the consumer, and the consumer is guided through a set of self-fulfillment processes and can upgrade their system more easily without any human contact. So I'd say we saw some we see some modest adjustments, and we're sort of angling to support more of that. But I also do want to note that a lot of the service providers are able to get out there and fulfill demand to the consumer.
Nikolay Beliov: Thank you, guys.
Stephen Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau from William Blair. Please go ahead.
David Robinson: Hi guys. This is David Robinson on for Matt. I just had a question around the video analytics commentary. So I know, in the past, you disclosed how kind of uptake of video analytics has improved year-over-year. Since you had kind of a good quarter with regards to the camera sales, I was wondering if you had metrics or any more commentary on how those customers are uptaking the analytics solution?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. David, I'd say we probably saw more of the same in the first quarter slightly higher video attachment rate. I think the last time we updated that metric, we said over 35% video attachment on an overall basis. And I'd say it held. It was slightly above that in the first quarter. And then on analytics, specifically, more than half of the new installations, getting our pro video solution, if you exclude those Connect customers where we can't deploy it within one case, but if you exclude that, you look at OS that are deploying our video solution on the core platform. At this point, it's over half for taking video analytics. And that also is trending upwards on.
David Robinson: Some great business, thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Reed Motulsky from Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.
Reed Motulsky: Yes, hi. In terms of the core industry award, has that helped you gain share with the small and medium business market via traction with the integrators? Or what does the Alarm has to do to improve your value to the integrators in that category?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. So that award, it's a bigger deal than maybe you might think. If you're working with integrators and service providers, and you're constantly streaming out new technology, your product is only as good as the support behind it. And we've got a lot of people that depend on us, they're going to business or they're going to the residential customer and they're trying to install something that's new, it's pretty critical that they feel like they've got a reliable partner and service infrastructure behind that piece of technology. So it's a domain where we treat it as a very high priority and we do a good job of it. That's our core team. So being recognized by the business intelligence group for that contribution, I think, does help the business. It means that when our sales team is these days on Zoom, speaking to prospective system integration partners, they can point to third-party credible third-party references that suggests that we will be there. We don't just say it, we will be there for our partners and support them in a professional manner. So I think it does help us, particularly in dealer recruitment, but even in dealer retention. It's almost sales for us. If you're supporting the dealer well, they'll keep using you.
Reed Motulsky: Great. And regarding cloud services from OpenEye, what progress has been made in terms of the SaaS offering for customers?
Stephen Trundle: I'm sorry, I missed the second part of that question, David.
Reed Motulsky: What progress has been made in terms of software as a service offering for customers?
Stephen Trundle: Right, OpenEye, sure. That's right on plan. So I think we OpenEye was, like all parts of the hardware business, being impacted by the pandemic, but we're not slowing down the transition of the model there to more of a SaaS model. I don't know if I have a metric I can update you on to give you an indication of that progress but probably not, but we are continuing that transition sort of on or even a little bit ahead of plan based on the anecdotal sales feedback I'm getting on some of the OpenEye.
Reed Motulsky: Got it. And then can I go to sales feedback, is that if more people working remotely want more stuff on the cloud sort of thing going on?
Stephen Trundle: Well, it definitely helps. If you're especially the small business customer, you need to the value there are two points where real value is created right now. One is if you're an actual customer and you have a business or you're the manager of a business, being able to remotely manage that business at this point or at least remotely in on it, keep track of things is more important than ever. And then the second price of sort of real value coming from the remotes that our cloud infrastructure enables is for the service providers themselves. They don't want to have to go visit a customer to make a repair. At this point, if it gets all avoidable, you have really good remote tools that work through the cloud, and you can do things like debug or reconfigure a Wi-Fi connection or powers like over the radio , whatever it may be, if you can do those types of things remotely and minimize the number of visits you need to make to a property, it makes it more feasible for our service providers to support their customers remotely. So definitely, it has been and in fact, I heard from one service provider who said, look, I didn't fully appreciate the value prop of Alarm.com until this pandemic. And now I can't imagine getting through it without your tools. So we've seen some endorsements like that, that are encouraging and I think that does come from a cloud infrastructure.
Reed Motulsky: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you.  I show no further questions in the queue. This concludes our Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You many now disconnect.

61;ALRM;2020-08-05;"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Alarm.com Q2 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. . I would now like to introduce today's conference call to Mr. David Trone, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
David Trone: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alarm.com's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Joining us today from Alarm.com are Steve Trundle, President and CEO; and Steve Valenzuela, CFO.
Stephen Trundle: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone. We are please to report solid second quarter results. Our SaaS and license revenue in the second quarter was $95.7 million, up 16.2% over the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $29.2 million. I want to thank our service provider partners and the alarm.com team for their continued strong performance as we navigate these challenging times. Our results were driven by decent momentum in new account installation in the U.S. which picked up nicely in the back half of the quarter after a slowdown caused by the COVID-19 shutdowns in March and April.  Our service provider partners adjusted to the environment and successfully implemented new safety procedures that allow them to return to conduct the installation. We believe that their trusted reputations reassure consumers who seemed mostly comfortable with allowing our partners to operate inside their property. On today's call I'll focus on our OpenEye team's recent product and integration development and then discuss initiative to help our service providers continue to adapt to the evolving market condition. I'll close by commenting on the recent announcement by ADT and by providing some additional details on the effect of COVID on the markets that we serve. Beginning with OpenEye, as you probably remember, we acquired the company last year to expand our commercial opportunity in the large enterprise and national accounts market. The cloud services component of the $4.4 billion video based security market in the Americas region is forecasted to increase from 9% of the total market in 2018 to 15% of the market in 2022. OpenEye is a leader in this transformation with its innovative solutions. I should note that OpenEye has experienced more disruption from COVID than the North American residential component of our business. They tend to service schools, financial institutions, restaurant chains, and other large or multi site customer locations. These sites have been less accessible for installations. In some cases, project budgets have also been paused, while companies manage these uncertain conditions. We view this disruption as temporary. Meanwhile, we have been very focused on executing our internal goals for alarm.com integration of OpenEye and the R&D program we have for the platform. OpenEye recently launched OWS 24/7 Lite, a pure SaaS offering optimized to address mid tier commercial customers. It supports up to 24 recording channels per system and provides access to streamlined versions of the OpenEye platforms robust enterprise feature set.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you, Steve. I will begin with a review of our second quarter 2020 financial results and then provide guidance for the third quarter and our raised outlook for the full year of 2020 before opening the call for questions. SaaS and license revenue in the second quarter grew 16.2% from the same quarter last year to $95.7 million. This includes Connect software license revenue of approximately $9.8 million for the second quarter, down from $11 million in the year ago quarter. Our SaaS and licensed revenue visibility remains high with a revenue renewal rate of 94% in the second quarter, at the high end of our historical range of 92% to 94%. And consistent with levels prior to the COVID pandemic. Hardware and other revenue in the second quarter was $45.9 million, up 16.8% over Q2, 2019. We continue to see strong sales over video cameras, which primarily accounted for a large increase in hardware sales. Total revenue of $141.6 million for the second quarter grew 16.4% from Q2, 2019. SaaS and license gross margin for the second quarter was 86.4%, up approximately 180 basis points from Q2 2019 gross margin of 84.6%, due to improved efficiencies we've been able to achieve in our operations. Hardware gross margin was 21.6% for the second quarter, compared to 18.9% for the same quarter last year, primarily due to product mix and inclusion of OpenEye which has a slightly higher hardware margin. Total gross margin was 65.4% for the second quarter compared to 63.4% for the same quarter last year, mainly due to favorable product mix. Turning to operating expenses. R&D expenses in the second quarter were $36.6 million, compared to $28.4 million in the second quarter of 2019.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James.
Adam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Steve Trundle, I thought I would just maybe start with kind of a general strategic update. Your backdrop in the industry is -- environments very volatile, but your performance has been quite stable, probably pretty different from competitors. You got a healthy balance sheet, stable, predictable business, afford you some optionality to maybe get a little bit more on offense. So, maybe just talk about how you're thinking about using this business stability as a competitive advantage. Is now the time to start thinking about doing something larger? And then the key metrics or characteristics you're looking for in investments?
Stephen Trundle: Sure. Adam, I think, yes, we're in a fortunate position. I think our service providers are doing generally pretty well. And that provides a good amount of stability. The businesses are very driven by recurring revenues, so makes them more predictable. I think as we look forward, I mean, we're not going to dramatically change our strategy. I think what you see us do continuously is reinvest back into R&D and steadily attempt to expand the footprint of the offering that we make available to our service providers, so they can expand their markets. So you've seen us over the years moved from residential to residential video, to commercial, to access control, et cetera. That's important for our service providers that we'd be able to sort of cover the full spectrum of IoT application services. Likewise, we've been expanding globally and that takes pretty intensive investment. So that said, there are couple of things probably that we continue to focus on a bit more. One is our corporate development function. We spoke a lot about OpenEye just a moment ago. And that's the result of an active corporate development operation. So we'll continue to sort of vet opportunities and look for places where we can add value. And then I think that we may shift to a slightly more aggressive marketing posture over the next year. So there'll be some steps like that. But generally, I think we're doing well. It's a challenging time to get so bullish, especially with the COVID uncertainty that sort of creates an overhang that you want to -- at this moment in time bet big on a new direction, but I think generally we're taking advantage of the dynamic to run our recruiting engine hot, look to fill key positions that are open and continue to grow in a lot of different directions.
Adam Tindle: Understood. That's helpful. Maybe just as a follow up more near term, SaaS revenue growth obviously accelerated this quarter, I think over 4% sequential growth. If you could just touch on some of the key drivers between ARPU, dealer ads, retention. And you also mentioned that I think subscriptions picked up at the end of the quarter. Could you give us an update what you're seeing here in early August? Did that pick up at the end of the quarter continue kind of linearly, as you sit here in early August? Thank you guys.
Stephen Trundle: Yes. Good question. So the thing that probably surprised us in the quarter was the strength of the U.S., particularly the U.S. residential market, which picked up a little more quickly than we expected. And really, at this point, is running pretty well. And that, we have a number of partners that are doing extremely well. That kind of covered some of the weakness that we saw commercially and internationally. The international markets have not come back quite as quite as quickly. So a lot of the growth was driven by outperformance and U.S. residential. Now there also was some strong performance in the subs. If you look at the 10-Q, I don't know if it's out yet or not. But you'll see 60% year-over-year growth on the SaaS line in the subsidiary businesses and a good bit of that's driven by energy hub bringing on really moving to a more mature status in some of their electric utility relationships. And that's nice tailwind for the business. So some of it is ARPU driven. But at the moment, our posture on ARPU is to really focus on the value we're providing the service providers and make sure that we're not trying to get everything on the table necessarily, but instead deliver to the consumer steadily better experience. That said, video analytics has been continuing to pick up. And as customers use more, it really is a nice offering, as customers use more of the capabilities that we're able to render, then we get a trickle of improvement on the ARPU rate over time as well.
Adam Tindle: Thanks, Steve.
Stephen Trundle: Yes. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nikolay Beliov, Bank of America.
Nikolay Beliov: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a two-part question for Steve Trundle. Part one, Steve, is this convergence between internet and home security around viewers. What does it mean at a high level from strategic point of view? And sound like, clearly the chess game against the -- now the chess game around the smart home has began just more complicated with this transaction this week. I mean, how do you think about this in the long term? What does it mean for your business? And how do you as a CEO think about this development?
Stephen Trundle: So, that's two-part question. I'll start at the first part. Convergence of internet service provisioning with security, I think was your first question, if I understood it correctly, it cracked up a tad. That's been underway. I mean, we've gone from a world where we were putting in almost entirely wireless technology to one where more and more we're leveraging the consumers internet connectivity, particularly for video services, at times for integration of additional third party devices. So, as you leverage that communication pipe, in our world we have to make sure it's very reliable. We don't -- we're not doing games online with our teenagers here. We're trying to provide a very reliable security service. So our service providers have been sort of migrating in a bit into the business of offering or attempting to help the consumer improve the reliability of their internet services, and we are self ship. I don't think we've made a lot of noise about it. But we ship something called the Alarm.com smart gateway, specifically for that purpose and that it allows the dealer to remotely administer the connectivity inside the home that is feeding video cameras and other internet connected devices. And it's become -- that -- we did it to make the service providers more efficient, make it more easy for them to service customers remotely. But it's becoming sort of an additional piece of their offering. So I think that will continue. Of course, we also have some MSO customers. And there, the benefit is more of a bundled offering. But as I look at sort of the landscape, has the world gotten more complicated? I think it's sort of has and hasn't and that -- I think this announcement does demonstrate that the professional service provider company and channel is a very attractive place to be in the smart home market. We've been saying that for some period of time that there really are multiple market segments, and the one that we probably focus most intensely on is professional service provider. And that's been good for us over the years. So, you see an additional endorsement in a way of that strategy that we adopted over a decade ago. And at the same time, I think with this announcement in particular, it's just a little too early to tell. I think we've been a solid partner. We've got over 3 million customers in collaboration with ADT that we're servicing together. We've got a lot of competence and capability that I think will be valued as we look forward. So we're looking forward to a set of discussions and a roadmap planning session in the not-too-distant future and we'll see where things go. I don't necessarily -- it may be that we see some additional devices and whatnot integrated. But I think it's a little earlier -- early to tell exactly how that washes out.
Nikolay Beliov: I mean, just a clarification question, I can see how that makes from, okay, dual-brand strategy, ADT having DIY and professional services that at the same time. And that maybe didn't work out with Google, Brinks, that's well, but it was okay. And it sounds like Google wants to take it to the next level. But I guess the threat to you is that Google at some point might have a back end system for dealers that comparable in strength to your current technology. So maybe if you can help us compare and contrast what Google has today in that regard versus the capabilities of your system? Thank you.
Stephen Trundle: Yes. I think a lot of that contrast is based on pedigree and that since 2004, so for quite a while we've been focused on first and foremost, the customer being the professional service provider, and building out the back end application software that allows professional service provider to manage a very large deployment when they themselves oftentimes have multiple dealers. So there's a lot of application where that's required that -- probably half of what we produces is not directly in front of the consumer. Certainly, when we get into commercial applications as well, we get into very rich login hierarchies and permissioning routines and whatnot that you have to do. We wouldn't have done them if we were just getting started the last few years. I think that, if I were to contrast, I think where Google has been very strong is on the consumer device side with very elegantly designed devices that are rich in functionality, that have been in some cases, market shifting. If you think about the Nest thermostat. And then the focus on the software side has really I think been on rendering an experience around those devices to the consumer. Not really a focus on rendering a platform for a service provider. So we're starting in a very different place and it may well be that with the right amount of collaboration, we can sort of accelerate on both sides. I'm not sure yet. But those are the basic -- some of the basic differences. I think if you look at what we do, we're also covering a lot of different market segments with a single platform. So whether you're dealer that servicing small business or residential or you're going DIY or you've got a health component in your business. You may be installing access control, whatever it is, we kind of tailored the offering to work for the service provider. And at the moment, that's a pretty different place than where Google is coming from, where they've had a strong focus on, really the devices that the consumer users in the home.
Nikolay Beliov: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Robinson with William Blair.
David Robinson: Hey, guys. I just had a question on the OpenEye SaaS offering. So I was just curious, how -- maybe you can kind of elaborate on how the selling process compares to the legacy offering? And I know in the past, you said that you intended to put some additional sales resources behind OpenEye. So Is that still the case? And will that kind of change? What the target customer will look like compared to the legacy offering as well?
Stephen Trundle: Now good question. Really it's on two fronts when we think about Salesforce enhancement. On the one side, the OpenEye team is enhancing sort of the scale of their sales team and the number of -- the number -- the amount of outreach they can do. And then on the other hand, we're beginning to introduce the offering through the Alarm.com partner sales team that we've had in place for a long time. Now as we take components of OpenEye and begin to introduce that through the Alarm.com channel, it is made sense to tailor what I described a moment ago as OWS Lite, which is a sort of a less and not as much of an enterprise version product. But more of a true SaaS product that has very low upfront cost and that is more akin to what our service providers are use to using, use to reselling. We'll continue with the OpenEye platform in the enterprise sales segment. So there are always going to be a set of customers who want to pursue who are very large, typically institutions, universities, places like that, that want to pursue a more classical enterprise deployment with racks of servers and their own knock, running software, running the OpenEye package. Now that enterprise deployment is backed up by the way with a very nice fast software layer, so that we can remotely administer, remotely manage all of that infrastructure on the enterprise side. But I guess the short answer is going to keep doing enterprise. The build out has been lately on the sort of a lightweight SaaS offering which you think will be more applicable for slightly smaller locations, more applicable to a broader segment of the market and will have in our view, kind of using our traditional model slightly more attractive and durable long term economic model with less upfront cost to the to the subscriber.
David Robinson: Great.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.
Jeff Kessler: Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter in a tough environment. I'm interested in your announcement on the Johnson Controls International. That's the old ADT brand out there that actually rose kind of pushed aside in many ways, but by Verisure. And was considered in some cases and also ramp. But you've gotten into Europe with -- you got it to Europe with securitize, and now you're going to help out and with a potentially very large base of consumer types of systems are you going to be with Johnson Controls? Are you going to be targeting just to consumer? Or will you be moving up into like small business or even enterprise business with them over time? Can you talk about the European strategy because it seems that you're beginning to start covering the entire continent?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes. Now that's -- it's insightful you picked up that announcement. I think many people in the U.S. had forgotten about ADT International, but it's still a very large and successful business outside of U.S. And it's really not just Europe, it's parts of Asia. I think we're launching in 11 countries, parts of Asia, Europe, couple parts of Latin America. And initially the focus there is on the residential side of that business primarily and bringing the customer a richer set of services, upgrading a lot of existing customers to a richer set of Alarm.com powered services. And kind of managing that attrition but also freshening up the presentation of what ADT International brings to the consumer. So that's going --they've executed remarkably well in the first six, eight months of the year, and that's going pretty well. In terms of our overall ambition. Yes, I think our ambition is to leverage every investment we make for the North American market as much as possible for the international market. So when we make investments in commercial or access control or video analytics, we never sort of sit here and say, well, this is a U.S. only feature. We asked ourselves, is the feature going to be relevant based on the Intel we have to other segments and other partners elsewhere in the world. And therefore, much as we see here in North America, different service providers service different parts of the market, whether the enterprise, small business, et cetera. Some do it all. But because there's a lot of fragmentation we'll continue to work with lots of different partners and hopefully, over time upgrade the overall sort of smart property experience that a consumer can expect in these other markets.
Jeff Kessler: And Will this be -- is this separate and apart from your key with secure cost? Is this going to be in conjunction with them? Is there going to be some overlap? How are you going to work this?
Stephen Trundle: No. It's -- Jeff, it's similar to how we work with 9000 service providers already where, we take a little bit as much as we can have a Switzerland role. And we do a lot of R&D, which then we then amortize across a lot of different service providers. So we have a good relationship with Securitas. We intend to fully support them. But this is not -- ADT International is just a different company. So it's not an affiliation type of deal.
Jeff Kessler: Right. Understood. Just quickly on energy hub. You had some kind of nice words for them as part of your growth, particularly in SaaS growth during the quarter. Could you expand on that a little bit? What is going on that's -- that's so successful right now in energy hub, since it seems to helped your numbers this quarter?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. I'll talk tactics and then a little bit strategy. On tactics, I think we've from time to time have announced new energy hub partners, some of whom have been large -- fairly large and notable utilities. We have not been able to announce every deal they've signed, because some of those partners want to keep that information confidential and keep their deployment information confidential. So, we've announced some, we haven't announced them all. Last year, most of the -- a lot of those opportunities were sort of in the startup phase where you're running trials and pilots, you're getting things in place. And then, I think some of the accelerated growth we saw in the second quarter on that side of the business came from the fact that those relationships were maturing and are now reaching a full deployment. Now, let me back up talk a little about strategy there, which is the concept is that you connect to any energy consuming components that may exist in a primarily in a residential property. So we already do a lot of that through the Alarm.com business. But we also on the energy hub side partner with a lot of folks you might not typically expect us to partner with even people that we would traditionally describe as competitors, anyone making a device that can be tethered to a power line is someone that may be a partner of ours, whether it be an HVAC manufacturer or water heater manufacturer or a thermostat manufacturer, a pool pump, manufacturer, whoever it may be. And we then aggregate all of that data and a certain amount of control and put that into the hands of the electric utility, so they can better manage and control what's happening on the edge of their grids and at time -- at times even influence the way that they level load their production. So that's just becoming, it's a good business to be in. It takes scale. It takes a long time. You get some traction with a few and that then carries over into a few other relationships. So, that's sort of -- and of course, the edge of the grid for these guys is not getting easier. You've got batteries. You got solar inverters, you've got more and more there on the consumer side that you need to track, you need to manage, you need to understand. So all of those components generating additional data, which makes that good place for a software provider to prosper.
Jeff Kessler: Okay. Thank you very much.
Stephen Trundle: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. Hey, Steve, you mentioned unexpected strength in U.S. residential in the quarter. Maybe just help us understand what drove that just related to expectations?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. So I think last quarter, we talked about generally new account creation been at around 70% of what we had planned. And that caused us to be a little bit -- to be more cautious as we gave an outlook for the rest of the year. We thought that would ramp, but we weren't sure when. I think what happened is it ramp inside of the quarter quite a bit. And I think what maybe surprised us a bit is how willing the consumer is to allow a company with a trusted reputation. So if you're someone -- if you're one of our service providers, whether it would be ADT, Brinks, anyone  lots of them, they have great reputations. And customers are willing to let a well branded sort of trusted entity into their home, if they perceive that they're taking the proper safety precautions. At the same time, you've got a lot of consumers that are at home and can get stuff done. So to the extent they've been thinking about getting a smart home system or want to upgrade their system, they've been more available, more available. More available for sales visits, more available for installations. And I think we didn't see that kind of -- its ours. If you look at the size of the COVID pandemic in U.S. and you wouldn't necessarily expect that relative to the rest of the world, but even in markets, Florida, Texas elsewhere, where we perceive there being a more intense pandemic situation. We've seen the consumer be very resilient.
Kevin McVeigh: And then again, just going back to ADT, Google. From a market perspective have you think just the competitive landscape reset. To the extent obviously, you work through a lot of distributors. How do you think the other distributors react? I mean, I know, that's a hard question. But do you think it triggers other type of relationships similar to what Google ADT have or just any thoughts on if there is any kind of industry fundamental change?
Stephen Trundle: Okay. I think I'm getting a little background noise there, but I'm not sure where that's coming from. But I'll say, that I think the -- first it's a little early to tell. We don't really know exactly how this recent announcement will shake out. What it means for the market. And therefore, I'm not -- it's difficult for me to predict exactly how other service providers will react. I would say, in general, though, that the market has been competitive for a long time, both on the technology side and the service provider side. And competition is generally, it can be a good thing for us and our relationship with our service providers, because it drives the need for innovation. And we're in a position where we're laying in place investments to maintain a very innovative posture. So if you want to stay current and deliver the consumer a Tier 1 experience, I hope and I think that we are the right partner for you and that it will, regardless of how things shake out that competitive technology environment will be good for Alarm.com.
Kevin McVeigh: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from Jack Vander Aarde with Maxim Group.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay. Hi guys. Excellent quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. Okay. So, first question for Steve Trundle. In one of my favorite topics to explore is the premium services front and kind of what new potential solution, services or any offerings during the pipeline that may go overlooked. Do not talked about as much. But could be quite unique to the current market while also being a material ARPU expansion driver. One example in my mind is the recent acquisition of AirDog, a maker of unmanned aircrafts. That sounds exciting. Could you maybe talk about the vision or the plan for unmanned aircrafts? And then anything else in the pipeline or on the drawing board you might be able to talk about?
Stephen Trundle: You're paying too much attention. Yes, so we're always attempting to expand the footprint of value that we can provide the consumer through our service providers. And I think you've been watching things. There have been a few things that are maybe not fully fruition yet, but that have that at times gotten a little bit of airplay. One being the connected car capabilities that we announced in the fourth quarter of 2019. That is sort of out there. But below the radar, not yet. In deployment. I think we've talked in the past about water and the importance of water monitoring and water management to the consumer. It's a place where we're making meaningful investments. And I have a lot of hope that within the next 12 months we'll see a very attractive offering there that's becoming more broadly deployed. With AirDog, we've been working for some time on making it possible for cameras to go where they need to go, to see what they need to see, as opposed to being absolutely in a fixed position or not able to track a dynamic event. So, kind of fundamental R&D there, but that's an ongoing initiative. And one that we'll continue to invest and don't have any immediate updates, but there are several things like that, that we -- our goal is to keep our service providers ahead. So we have to be looking out more than just sort of the next six months or 12 months. And be at times taking some fliers on things that to use upon, by the way on things that we think over time will generate differentiated value, but that take a while to do.
Jack Vander Aarde: Got it. That's helpful. And then also, Steve Trundle, if you could provide maybe a status update on PointCentral, which I imagine it's been likely impacted or more disruptive than your residential business, giving a vacation and property rentals. But they did acquire Doorport back in early May, which is already announced I think last quarter too. But any additional color you can provide on PointCentral? And maybe just informally speaking, when you might -- when might you see them scale into a larger contributor to Alarm as a whole to the business?
Stephen Trundle: Yes, exactly. So they were and are being impacted probably a bit more by COVID than some of the other segments. Their customers are the vacation rental companies. Now those companies are doing well again, right now. People are driving, staying in vacation homes much more than -- that's how most people are doing their summer vacation. So the market is good, but there's not a lot of opportunity to install new stuff this summer because everything's fully booked. The winter will be the time when we hopefully get back into the VRBO space with a faster install rate. They also though in the business of tying together and making available a full multifamily platform whether you're a company that owns thousands of rental homes, or whether you're an entity that's operating several 300 unit multifamily buildings, PointCentral provides a smart property solution for that segment that benefits both the property owner, the property manager and the tenant themselves. And Doorport was germane to that vision more on the multifamily side particularly with higher rise -- high rise residential, we wanted to add value at the access point that the tenant is using with a smart intercom solution. And we want to be able to do that both via set of partnerships. So we're partnering with several folks that are in the intercom business, but also with a fairly affordable retrofit solution that is not dependent on the building's internet connection. So a cellular retrofit solution and we thought that Doorport was an innovator in that domain and will fold into the PointCentral multifamily offering nicely and strengthen our technology position there.
Jack Vander Aarde: Got it. That that's helpful as well. And then lastly, I'll take last one and then queue here. For Steve Valenzuela, so the SaaS and license revenue guidance for 2020 was raised. I know, a lot of analysts have already kind of questioned or had questions about this. But it does imply robust growth. And that's great to see. Just hoping you can maybe break it down though in terms of the underlying drivers. Would you say, what are the factors there that they're embedded there in terms of maybe international subscriber growth. Does embed international subscribers grow, commercial subscribers grow? And then how much it's split towards this ARPU expansion in general?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, Jack, thanks for the question. I'm actually here. This is the first question I got. So it's good to get a question. So yes, the SaaS pro forma, as you've talked about, really is new subscriber ads, really in North American residential being the major driver. We continue to see really good progress and really good uptake with video analytics. And as Steve talked about that does inch up the ARPU a bit. But again, I think we're benefiting from a faster if you will V shaped recovery in North American residential, being a main driver, that's helping offset some slowdown and international. We have a number of new dealers internationally that are proceeding is just at a slow ramp given the COVID pandemic. And then commercial, of course, has been impacted a bit. But I think the main driver has been strong new subscriber ads in North American residential. The retention rates have been rock solid, even, compared. Basically at the same level prior to the pandemic. And so, we're getting a boost from new subscriber ads, and at a faster rate than we anticipated, with a same level of retention and ARPU inching up.
Jack Vander Aarde: That's helpful. And maybe -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
Steve Valenzuela: That's really driving the SaaS growth.
Jack Vander Aarde: And just because you reference the strong renewal rates or small attrition rates. Does that hold true for international as it does in North America? Or is there any difference there?
Steve Valenzuela: International is still relatively new. So we don't really break it out. I don't think that there's really any significant difference between the two. Of course, North American residential, we've been doing for many, many, many years from the very beginning. The International is still relatively new. And so you don't have that base of subscribers. But we typically don't break it out. I would say that I'm not aware of any major differences in retention between international and North American residential.
Stephen Trundle: Again, in our work so far, it's look pretty similar, pretty similar to the point we don't model it differently. Yes, that's right.
Steve Valenzuela: Yes.
Jack Vander Aarde: Fantastic. All right, guys. Again, great quarter, solid results and I appreciate the time. Thanks.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks, jack.

63;ALRM;2021-02-25;"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Alarm.com Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. . I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Trone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
David Trone:
Stephen Trundle: Thank you, David. Good afternoon and welcome to everyone. We are pleased to report fourth quarter results that exceeded our expectations. Our SaaS and licensed revenue in the fourth quarter was $105.5 million, up 17.1% over the last year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $32.4 million.  Despite the challenging global environment, the fourth quarter closes out a strong 2020 with total revenue growing 23% year-over-year. I want to thank our service provider partners and our employees for their resilience and contribution to our performance.  We closed the year with more than 10,000 service provider partners who sell and service our technology in more than 7.6 million customer properties in over 40 countries around the world. On today's call, I will review some of the key elements of our long-term strategy and highlight a few examples of the many new products and capabilities that we introduced to our markets in 2020.  When we think about our strategy, our first goal is to be the defining security-oriented IoT platform for four different market segments; residential, multifamily, small business, and enterprise commercial. For each of these market segments, our vision is to provide fully integrated, best-in-class applications that span security and surveillance, automation, energy management, water management and health.  We're developing these applications for multiple geographies, such that we can leverage our platform investments around the globe. We made solid progress on this vision in 2020. In the commercial market, for example, we recently released CloudConnect. This is a two-way integration between the OpenEye Cloud Video Platform and the Alarm.com for Business platform. CloudConnect directly associates event data from intrusion sensors and access control readers with OpenEye’s Video Surveillance-as-a-Service product. Based on this rich set of event data, subscribers can easily customize intelligent video recording rules, set alerts to keep track of important events and easily find video footage associated with specific activity. 
Steve Valenzuela:
Operator: . Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.
Jeff Kessler: I'd like to ask a question regarding the growth of, let's say, the several areas that are in other, but have been out there for a while, EnergyHub, PointCentral. Is there a larger plan to essentially bring analytics up and perhaps at some point bring OpenEye down, if needed, to provide both video analytics and perhaps someday even at your -- improved access to all of those areas, including energy management, because obviously utilities at some point in time beyond their grid needs are going to need operational and then physical security as well. And the same thing applies to multifamily, even though they're in different segments, but talking about general commercial use. And I'm just wondering, with that growing segment, how much can you get out of it?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. Good question, Jeff. This is Steve. So starting with the electric utilities, and there is a -- it's not video analytics, but there is an AI engine there at work already today to render a capability that we call smart chip that allows us to really level the load on the grid by anticipating how quickly a consumer will opt to change their thermostat once we began to downshift the thermostat. So there's a lot going on in the background there that is AI. We haven't, to be candid with you, the focus at EnergyHub has really been on what we think is a strong market for distributed energy resource management. And the race right now is to incorporate as many of the edge consuming devices or edge producing devices into the platform as you possibly can. So that's why I talked about EV as an example, batteries as an example, solar will be an example. The better picture we can give there, the stronger the platform becomes. Now, you're correct though that over time, if we have a nice position in a number of those customers, then certainly leveraging in our enterprise grade security apparatus for managing substations, managing production facilities, whatnot, would make a lot of sense. But it's not currently the focus. The EnergyHub teams got enough sort of right in front of them that that's not right now a focus there. Contrast that with PointCentral where there's sort of more immediate synergy, I would say, when you get to the multifamily housing market. The goal starts with sort of an access and a tenant friendly apparatus to let people in and out. But pretty quickly, the property manager does ask, and this is where our service providers are very, very helpful, does ask for all of that kind of convenience to also be integrated with an industrial strength sort of security and surveillance mechanism. And there the video analytics, you can imagine, we want to get data gathering where video itself is data, data gathering devices as many places as we possibly can, including some of the actual entry portal devices, readers and otherwise. So there I think, absolutely leveraging the full sort of video analytics platform back into multifamily will make a lot of sense and will help us drive growth and also just drive better service for both the consumer and the property manager.
Jeff Kessler: Okay, great. And one quick question for Steve. With the recent converted offering, can you give us some idea of what your interest expense should be -- is expected to be for 2021?
Steve Valenzuela: Hi, Jeff. This is Steve Valenzuela. So the good news is interest expense, the convertible has a zero coupon. So one of the benefits, of course, of the convertible is we retired our senior debt, which carried an interest rate of about 2% to 2.5%. Now there is some GAAP imputed interest cost that gets adjusted out of non-GAAP. That's really more of an accounting adjustment that has to be booked, but it's not a cash expense. So effectively our cash expense will be zero. Cash expense will be zero.
Jeff Kessler: All right, great. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks, Jeff.
Stephen Trundle: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Adam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. Steve Trundle, you outlined the vision to be the platform in four different areas and just curious to touch base on ways to accelerate that vision. So commercial and international specifically have had a few years to develop under the dealer base and still not quite at escape velocity at this point. I'm wondering if it makes sense to perhaps revisit the go to market, perhaps add a direct sales force in conjunction to dealers to add fuel to the fire, or other ideas you're contemplating on how to accelerate that broader platform vision?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. So I almost have to break them into two, commercial and then international, starting with commercial. I think we probably missed some acceleration in 2020 that we might have otherwise seen there just because the commercial market, not just for us, but I think for anyone playing in the commercial market was a little soft with the pandemic. There were a lot of folks that froze up capital expense budgets. It was hard to get into facilities. Retail kind of backed off entirely. And it just wasn't quite as frothy as we would have expected. That said, commercial is growing at a meaningful rate and contributing ever more of our SaaS and licensed. I think the things we can do to accelerate it, we're not going to go with the direct sales force. We're happy with our service providers. We’ll continue to recruit additional integrators, continue to train. But I do think we have places where we can continue to build out the platform to become even more broadly relevant. And one example of that we did in Q4 was the SDS acquisition, which gets us into another type of customer that has a real concern about protecting their employees in a larger institutional setting. So we’ll do that. We also did some things on OpenEye. So our focus will be more on the product and technology side in terms of, we always sort of live by a mantra that if we can get to the best product, the most capable product, then good things will happen downstream. And we trust our service providers to sort of adopt what we produce. On the international side, I think we're in a pretty good spot going into this year. Last year it was soft, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, much more impact from COVID than we saw in the U.S. But again, kind of having some trust in partners. I do think we have -- we've got a good set of base service providers there already. We've got a few more in the works. And even though production was still up last year, we ended the year producing 50% more accounts per month than we were producing at the beginning of the year. So production was up, but it will I think go up even more this year as folks are coming back online. And there are still things Adam honestly on the product side that continue to need to be addressed for various markets globally that will also help.
Adam Tindle: Okay, thanks. And maybe as a follow up, I think if I factor in the convert, the cash, the debt pay down, you're somewhere in the $0.5 billion range in liquidity, I think it's more than ever in the company. So with that as the backdrop, maybe you could touch on the framework and important points that you look for in potential acquisition targets. And are there any internal limitations from a systems or platform standpoint that would preclude a sizable $0.5 billion plus type of a deal?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. So we're pretty optimistic with what we do. We felt like the market was in kind of a very favorable state towards the end of the year and it was an unusually right time to add some dry powder to the balance sheet, and also actually lift some of the constraints that were associated with our prior debt instrument in terms of covenants and otherwise. So we wanted to get ourselves in a place where we really have the opportunity to be optimistic when the right opportunity comes along. In terms of how we evaluate things, first and foremost will be the team. At a potential acquisition target, our belief that they can continue to grow their business with our help, whether we can work with them effectively, all of those types of basic human issues actually in my experience turn out to be the most important issues over time. So that's most important. After that, strong technology stack is -- or an ability for us to make the technology stack, tech stack particularly strong becomes number two. And then number three becomes sort of the market we address, our feelings about that market, the synergies with our distribution channel and really the ability to contribute to our SaaS portfolio. So those are the few things we look at. In terms of size, I'd say we're less constrained now in terms of size than where we were six months ago. So we have an ability. There's nothing really that would prevent us from deploying that capital if we saw the right opportunity to use it. And we'll see how the markets look here for the next year or two.
Adam Tindle: Sounds good. Thanks for the details and congrats on 2020.
Stephen Trundle: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Robinson from William Blair. Your line is now open.
David Robinson: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question I had just on the Shooter Detection Systems acquisition. I guess how large do you expect that opportunity to be? And then I’m just curious if there is any differences and perhaps the selling motion for a system like this compared to your other commercial offerings, and if there are any differences in terms of, I guess the type of target customer that might purchase the gunshot detection system versus your other offerings?
Stephen Trundle: All good questions. So I’m trying to remember if we disclose the SDS size or is it --
Steve Valenzuela: No. You can see it in the 10-K. It’s broken out there. 
Stephen Trundle: It will be there. But it's a relatively small company at the moment with a marquee track record and a marquee customer base in terms of the -- it's not sort of fantasy. It's real with top flight Fortune 100 names that are deploying the technology in sort of areas where they have . We think -- in terms of how big it can be, that's kind of a -- I would call that a pleasant unknown. We don't know how big it can be. We have a hypothesis that it can grow substantially, that there's a need for that technology, and that with enhanced focus on marketing and distribution that we can drive meaningful growth there. But I don't think we -- we haven't owned it. And we haven't worked with the team quite long enough to really say, well, we think it's going to be 10x bigger than it is today. The type of customer is a little bit of a different customer than who we currently deal with. It's going to be a headquarters for a large tech company, for example. One of the things it will be super large oil and gas companies, those type of entities, institutions, governments, schools that are particularly focused on being able to protect a large number of people when there's an unfortunate event that's unfolding. The technology we believe will be tied into the rest of our commercial platform and enable us to do artful things with video and with access control that relate to the data coming from the SDS systems. So we have a tech roadmap that we're working. But the short answer is I don't really know how big it can be. I think there's a lot of upside there. I think the company’s solid, the management team’s solid and we’ll be trying to figure that out over the next three to six months.
David Robinson: Okay. I guess just a follow up since you kind of mentioned the synergies with the distribution channel as one of the focuses with regards to acquisitions. I guess are there dealers in your base now that are kind of familiar with this or will this take some I guess additional ramp up time?
Stephen Trundle: This will take some ramp up time. And really when you get into this particular domain, there's some engineering involved in actual configuration of the sensors and a headquarters facility or in a sports facility or whatever. So in this case, the company itself, SDS will retain a lot of that engineering and sort of pre-sales type of responsibility. We’ll work directly with these larger institutions to spec in what they need, and then certain set of integrators that are servicing that type of market will be pulled in. But not many of our existing, I should say, partners are in that sort of niche arena today.
David Robinson: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Darren Aftahi: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice quarter. Can I ask a question? I know you guys don't focus on hardware, but it looks like the midpoint of the hardware is flat year-on-year. So in that context, I'm curious. How much do you think on the residential side, because of COVID, maybe – and the house market being so hot, that demand has been pulled forward, if anything? And then how much of that hardware kind of assumption assumes there may be some problems with chip shortages, like the rest of the industry is experiencing? And then second question, just on your SaaS growth, what's sort of the implied assumption with sort of attach rate of newer products or additional products versus organic, just new subs? Thanks.
Stephen Trundle: Sure. Okay. On the hardware -- so I think the question is regarding sort of the assumptions we made in the hardware projection and the guide, and a couple of things there. First, as we said in years past, we don't really like to over guide the hardware. We don't see a lot of merit in getting ahead of ourselves there. It's not helpful  for the business. I do think we at least are working on an assumption that there was some demand pull forward in the residential market. We don't know for sure that that's true. But we think it's a reasonable assumption to take on 2020, and that was something we factored in a bit. At the same time, 2020 on the commercial side was significantly less productive on hardware revenue than really what we expected. So I think we anticipate that some of that will be unlocked in 2021 and will offset any potential changes on the residential side. And that's kind of a little bit of color of how we look at it. In terms of the implied growth on SaaS and whether that's coming from additional services or coming from just sort of new subs, I think that we have seen this year that the average new customer is taking more, not less of the Alarm.com services. We've also seen that -- even in a tough year, that commercial adoption which is a higher ARPU component of our service revenue is increasing and that's becoming a more meaningful chunk of our SaaS and license. So we expect that trend to continue, which means you're getting a little bit more per sub. And then we have seen -- our service providers have a lot of success as they go back and do 3G upgrades, but really even market to their existing base. There's been a fair amount of success last year. It was the best year yet of upgrading existing subscribers to additional services, particularly those around video. So I would say we're expecting all of those three things to contribute, which means the growth in sub counts in theory could be slightly -- could be less and still achieve the same SaaS growth level.
Darren Aftahi: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland Capital. Your line is now open.
Aditya Dagaonkar: Hi. This is Aditya on behalf of Mike Latimore. I was wondering about the ARPU. How much -- by what percentage did the ARPU change in 2020?
Steve Valenzuela: So the ARPU -- we don't really break out the ARPU in detail, but we have seen, as Steve Trundle talked about, with the adoption of both video and video analytics, because we do charge more for those, and the trend of new subscribers adding more services and even existing subscribers upgrading, that certainly does help. But when you've got 7.6 million subscribers, you can imagine it's like a big ship moving. It takes a while for that ARPU to move and that's really not the main driver. It's really the addition of new subs, additional services that are really contributing. So I would say -- we've said in the past that ARPU inches up over time. Of course, it varies dealer by dealer. There's incentives for various dealers. But I would say it does increase incrementally. But that's not the major driver of SaaS growth. It's really the addition of new subscribers and upgrading existing subscribers.
Aditya Dagaonkar: All right, that’s fine. And how much would you expect OpenEye to contribute in this year, 2021?
Steve Valenzuela: So we don't break out OpenEye. We did talk about how commercial was impacted in 2020 more, and so OpenEye certainly was part of that. And certainly in Q2, they were impacted more than they were and they saw some recovery in Q3 and a good recovery in Q4. So they did come in below the plan for 2020 we initially set as pre-COVID, but they actually grew year-over-year. So we're very encouraged with the performance by OpenEye. And we think as things open up, and as Steve said, as we round third, which I love that analogy --
Stephen Trundle: Yes, I was hoping third, exactly.
Steve Valenzuela: I’ll give a little more color there. When we acquired OpenEye, I think we had to adjust expectations on what we produce. And we said, we thought in the next 12 months, we’ll get around $40 million for OpenEye. I think based on my comments about the commercial market, you can assume we didn't get that. Last year, even though the company grew nicely year-over-year, we had a nice target for them. I think they're tracking to more than -- to perform at or above that target this year.
Aditya Dagaonkar: All right, that’s fine. That’s it. I’ll pass. Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Vander Aarde from Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Jack Vander Aarde: Great, thanks. Hi, Steve. Hi, Steve V. Excellent quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll start with a two-part question for Steve Trundle. Then I have a few for Steve Valenzuela. So Steve T, first, hoping you can provide your thoughts on key factors driving new subscriber activations in North America, which continue to obviously grow at healthy rates with that updated total you gave us, 7.6 million. I know it's not all North America, but I know the bulk are. Are you seeing anything new or unique maybe that's driving your recent subscriber growth just given COVID made people leaving cities and moving homes, just anything new that’s interesting worth noting?
Stephen Trundle: Actually, almost all of what you just stated would be -- so in the end, COVID led people home and we’re interested in taking care of things that had been on our to-do list I think. So actually it was easier in many ways to get their time and attention to have them choose what system they want. That's what we're hearing from our service providers. The customer got very comfortable with the sort of COVID precautions that our service providers were taking, for installation and for sales. Second, there has been a sort of a suburbanization move at some level, also a second home move. So we’ll see lots of transition there which drives demand. And then I think third is the actual technology continues to get better. And the value prop to the customer is improving all the time. And that's not just us. That's the entire industry. But I think the value prop is continuing to improve. And more people that might have said in the past, hey, I don't need a security system or an alarm system are now saying, hey, with what you're doing with video analytics, with the things you're doing on automation, with the ability to monitor for low grade leaks; toilet valves, it's busted, those type of things. There's just more sort of purpose for these systems. And I think that's kind of slowly moving the demand curve. And then lastly, I think we saw some confirmation last year that the market wants a service provider. And we probably worked through some of the DIY chunk of the market, some of those folks began to move upstream and more and more people seem to be wanting to acquire the technology with service and support. So I think those are the four trends we saw in North America, all supported by just a much more resilient economy than what we saw elsewhere in the world.
Jack Vander Aarde: Great, it's really helpful. And actually that's a nice segue to the third point you mentioned there, technology improvement and all these like helpful just point solutions outside of just security also driving interest. So my next question is in terms of the competitive environment and Alarm’s positioning, has anything kind of changed in your perspective regarding the key competitive factors for me, like, this kind of theme that was playing out more so a few years ago from the DIY focused competitors versus the alarms/pro install channel, anything changing there, because some of the DIY guys are public are having good numbers as well. And just wondering if it's all benefiting everyone or anything you have to share?
Stephen Trundle: Yes. I would say the thing that's going on competitively is it's just taking more -- everything is taking much more scale, probably the barriers to entry to really deliver a full solution are arising. The scale requirements are higher. The range of -- when you talk about video analytics, it wasn't even something we were talking about three years ago. And now we're in an arms race in that category with some large players. And you have to be able to resource and staff that effort accordingly to remain competitive. So probably the main competitive dynamic I think is that there's starting to be a little bit more of a technology shakeout evolving as the technology gets more sophisticated. And those who have scale are likely to be able to sort of persist. And those that don't are going to struggle some with this shakeout I think. We couldn't -- that sort of the size we were at 10 years ago, we couldn't be competitive today. So we're fortunate to be in the spot we're in given the range of capabilities that the consumer expects, that a small business expects, and that's probably the biggest thing going on.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay, that's helpful. And then for Steve Valenzuela, can you maybe provide some more color, maybe quantify whatever you can on the status of the international business maybe in terms of percentage of your overall 7.6 million plus subscribers? How many of those are international? And how many of your 10,000 plus channel partners are international, anything around that?
Steve Valenzuela: So we haven't broken that up. But what we have broken out is the international revenue was 3% of our total revenue. And we have added -- we've said we have about 40 different -- we're in about 40 different countries internationally. And we have added new service providers internationally this past year as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color.
Jack Vander Aarde: That does. And I'm still going to try to ask this next question regardless. So with the international markets in still early stage, still growing, maybe more impacted by COVID than your domestic markets, are there any kind of – I don’t know, what does it take to drive subscriber growth internationally from maybe a channel partner perspective? Is it similar to North America? It sounds like you're adding more of these -- more channel partners all the time and they're helping you really scale the business in North America. Is it similar internationally? Is the growth – how dependent  is growth of subscriber activations on adding new channel partners, or is it just expanding within your large existing international channel partners?
Steve Valenzuela: Yes, so a little more color. I think we started the year last year at around 10,000 units per month and we ended the year at around 15,000. We're happy with that, given the dynamics. Then we had regions, particularly like Latin America, that kind of just went dark almost for a long period of the year. So we expect -- we didn't lose any partners in that process. We kept our partners. We worked together to improve. I'd say from where we sit, the number one thing is bulletproofing the customer experience for each of these different markets with the full range of the capabilities that we deliver in the U.S. And it sounds easy, but it's 40 countries, lots of different networks, lots of different sort of consumer preferences on how things are done. But there's still a fair amount of technology and product work that we're doing in concert with our partners to get to the point that we fulfill everything we say we're going to do. We think we will continue to add partners. For example, demo houses in some markets, things of this nature, but it's going in the right direction. The number one thing is I said technology. It's really persistence. Keep trying, keep working, be a good partner, and eventually good things will come. We saw that in the U.S. It's actually -- I haven't looked at the data recently, but it took us -- at some point when we looked at it, our ramp rate in the U.S. was slower than what we're ramping in U.S. But at some point, you get sort of critical mass and it takes off. I'm sorry, the ramp rate U.S. was slower in earlier days than international. So we'll see.
Jack Vander Aarde: Okay, sounds good. Well, again, great quarter and look forward to following up next quarter. Thanks, guys.
Stephen Trundle: Thank you.
Steve Valenzuela: Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.";[-0.08778971362826915, -0.010583989006734296];-0.010583989006734296;-0.08778971362826915;0
64;AAPL;2017-02-01;"Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. And after that, we will open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2016 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon everyone, and thanks very much for joining us. I'm very happy to share with you the outstanding results of Apple's December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly revenue in Apple's history along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch, all-time revenue records for Services and Mac, and all-time revenue records for four out of our five geographic segments. The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings per share. Revenue in the quarter was $78.4 billion, which was above the top of our guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply/demand balance in January. iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising and delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more productive, more engaged, and more expressive than ever by integrating hardware, software, and services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver. It was our best quarter ever for Services, with almost $7.2 billion in revenue. App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever. Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple's developer community has now earned over $60 billion, including over $20 billion in 2016 alone. Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all-time record results. Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction volume was up over 500% year over year as we expanded to four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great results. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting invoice payments with Apply Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, FreshBooks, and other billing partners. And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay. Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our Services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our Services business in the next four years. The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC. The new MacBook Touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software. We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and are just now coming into supply/demand balance. It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it is the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch. We're also thrilled with the response to AirPods. Customers love the magical experience AirPods are delivering. And if you haven't tried them yet, you'll be delighted when you do. They're far ahead of anything else on the market today, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible demand. With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward. Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time, at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job. For example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay with over 200 different models announced, including five of the top 10 selling models in the United States. There are well over 1 million people using CarPlay now, and this continues to grow rapidly. And we are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch. The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems. I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit. We're making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco technology is giving companies everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to eight times faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown over 70% since last quarter. Enterprises are using IBM's new Mobile at Scale design and development model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, Finnair is transforming aircraft maintenance, and CEMEX is revamping activities from attracting new clients to invoicing to after-sales support. And later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cloud platform. We're delighted with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise customers to transform how work gets done with iOS. As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our developers, our business partners, and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment. And I'd like to thank all of our customers around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drive these results. Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca to talk about the quarter in more detail.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of Apple and above our guidance range. As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad-based, as we set new revenue records for iPhone, for Services, for Mac, and for Apple Watch. We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia. We accomplished all this despite a very challenging foreign exchange environment due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As we had expected, our year-over-year performance in Greater China improved significantly relative to the September quarter. Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago and grew in constant currency terms. In all other geographic segments, we generated all-time quarterly record results. We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year. Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue, and net income was $17.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow from operations was $27.1 billion. We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time record and an increase of 5% over last year. Customer demand was even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%. We saw double-digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia, and even stronger growth in many emerging markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Vietnam. iPhone ASP increased to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter, driven by the very strong product mix and the amazing success of iPhone 7 Plus. Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of iPhone channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than the increase of 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the low end of our 5 to 7-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are exceptional, not only with consumers, but also with business users. In the U.S., for instance, the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 97% customer satisfaction rating among all iPhone owners and a 99% satisfaction rating for owners of iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the iPhone customer satisfaction rating was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $7.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year. Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago. The App Store continued its impressive run, breaking all previous revenue records. Year-over-year App Store revenue growth was 43% through the first 13 weeks of the quarter. It's great to see that both average revenue per paying account and the number of paying accounts grew strongly during the quarter. And according to App Annie's latest report, App Store revenue continues to outpace the industry overall, with more than double the revenue of Google Play in calendar 2016. Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.4 million Macs and generated our highest-ever quarterly Mac revenue. We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the U.S. education market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4 to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 13.1 million units, which was ahead of our expectations. And we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers. We also reduced channel inventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low end of our five to seven-week target range. iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete, both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Mini, a 97% rate for iPad Air, and 96% for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad is more than four times higher than any other brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter. In fact, businesses of all sizes are choosing iPad and iPhone to have them reimagine their everyday activities. We're seeing strong momentum in sectors such as retail, where iOS solutions are being deployed for everything from product development to logistics to mobile point-of-sale. Companies like Toys ""R"" Us, Coach, and Kate Spade are using iOS and our mobility partner solutions to dramatically transform their customer and employee experiences. Our retail stores experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December quarter. And we continued to expand our global presence, with plans to open our first store in Singapore and our second store in Dubai soon. We are continually updating our stores and adding new and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code, and empower entrepreneurs to start, grow, and evolve their businesses. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $246.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $8.5 billion. $230.2 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was outside the United States. We also had $77.1 billion in term debt and $10.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding at quarter end. We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares. We also completed our eighth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 4.4 million shares. This led to a net diluted share count reduction of 65.3 million shares during the quarter. We've now completed $201 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $144 billion in share repurchases. And we plan to provide investors with our annual update on the capital return program in the spring. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, as expected. And as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. This guidance range includes a $1.2 billion year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We expect OpEx to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend up $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2017. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Yes, thank you. First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter? And what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? And then I have a follow-up, thank you.
Luca Maestri: Sure, Katy. If you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned that we expect – assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we land.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you. And, Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion-plus of cash that's been locked overseas. So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Katy, I am optimistic given what I'm hearing that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there are people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four years. And we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it. In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform in selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously, with our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that. Thanks for the question.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess the first question, I really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business, which is up 18% year over year. Can you just talk about? How much of that do you think is growth in your installed base versus increased monetization on a per iOS to iOS basis? And so we are to think about those in two separate tranches?
Luca Maestri: I think you're absolutely right, Amit. We look at it that those are the two key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double-digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right. So it's a combination of the two. Obviously, the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business. And that's why, as Tim said, we have a goal that – it's already become a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. And if I could just switch gears on a follow-up, there has been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year?
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah, I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points of that was currency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up 6%. So it's a significantly better performance on every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters. Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China, as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year over year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. And obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits. That said, the challenges that are there are, one, the currency has devalued 6% year over year. And two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it in – I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there. And I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, at least that's your expectation. So what gets you there? I don't know, maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies. And then, as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line.
Luca Maestri: Yeah, Shannon, I'll take it. Obviously, within the Services business, we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that we grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks, a little even more for the quarter, right. And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform. So we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music. Obviously now, by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth. We've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We've had very good success with exclusives. So we know that it's another business that we can grow. Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at a geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits. And as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the install base, and that gives us a tailwind. We're also opening up several new markets because we are accepting new forms of payment. And therefore, it's easier particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. You were asking about the margin profile. We said many times, in aggregate our Services business tends to have margins that are above company average. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles, also because, as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy/sell basis. In other cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, and that drives different margin percentages.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you. And then my follow-up is just in terms of the elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets the you were basically not able to – you weren't you're getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given the currency. But you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just curious. You raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that. What are you seeing, and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up?
Luca Maestri: Shannon, I was looking back. Since June of 2014, so we're talking about 2.5 years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I've mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible. The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There are more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong dollar doesn't help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Moving on, we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.
Brian J. White: Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range. It looks like gross margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter, please?
Luca Maestri: Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We felt very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn't help us on that front.
Brian J. White: Okay. And, Tim, I didn't hear much mentioned about India. How did India perform with the iPhone? And how should we think about it for 2017, especially with the 4G network going up?
Timothy Donald Cook: That's a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that. The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It's still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Simona Jankowski.
Simona K. Jankowski: Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I think you touched on the percent of switchers in China. But can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions and overall as well?
Timothy Donald Cook: Simona, it's Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk – I share all this with you for transparency's sake. I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop.
Simona K. Jankowski: Thank you, and then just one follow-up on China specifically. As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region. And then just to give us the context, I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China. But curious if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the iPhone 7 Plus, I'm curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China.
Timothy Donald Cook: That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. If you look at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it.
Simona K. Jankowski: Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yes.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you alluded to the fact that your install base was growing double digits. So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining. And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending – going lower. Replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple years. I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well. So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory has been over the last two years and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about?
Luca Maestri: I think it's a good question, a number of points that I want to make. Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business. When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate. But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance. The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn't help us. But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation.
Timothy Donald Cook: I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate. And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like litigation. And so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven M. Milunovich: Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive. You said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the Street's expectations. And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly. I don't know if it's a mix shift. But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward.
Timothy Donald Cook: The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900,000. In this quarter we decreased by 700,000. On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there. If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.
Steven M. Milunovich: Okay, that's great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I believe you said there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by users, and particularly changes beyond form factor, beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people?
Timothy Donald Cook: I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there's lots more to do. I think it's become – every year it becomes more important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health. I could have talked more about CarPlay. The use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this is one that we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more.
Steven M. Milunovich: Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yes.

65;AAPL;2017-05-03;"Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2016, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year. iPhone sales were line in line with our expectations, and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual-camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits year over year. And based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we track. Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones. For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services. App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million. Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch. We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 Messages per second, more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media. We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform. We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe. Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods, with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategy survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year-over-year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First half revenue was down 13% year over year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations, and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China. We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure. Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming customers from around the world. As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the timeframe through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms – iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS – that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more. I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it. Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented teams. We have many more ongoing investments in the United States economy, since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners, and we continue to invest confidently in our future. Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth rates were even higher, over 20% in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand. Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and net income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis. We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and our Rest of Asia-Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020. The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our five to seven-week target range. iPad remains very successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that range from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter. All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads. We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners, who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start, with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS at the end of March, and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise. The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services. And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation, with IBM Mobile First for iOS apps now in more than 3,300 client engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital transformation. Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion. $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we are allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units. In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. As we know, this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price. We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We'll also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Rebecca, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on.
Timothy Donald Cook: Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was – wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.
Shannon S. Cross: Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through?
Luca Maestri: Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: From JPMorgan, Rod Hall.
Rod Hall: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis.
Rod Hall: Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa.
Rod Hall: Great, thank you very much.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yes.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: From UBS, Steve Milunovich.
Steven M. Milunovich: Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term?
Timothy Donald Cook: Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months – so this is not a forecast – that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that – it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question.
Steven M. Milunovich: Thank you. And then there was a – you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned?
Timothy Donald Cook: I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency.
Steven M. Milunovich: Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thanks for the question.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi.
A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr.: Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history?
Timothy Donald Cook: Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a – I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that.
A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr.: Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona K. Jankowski: Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance.
Luca Maestri: As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have.
Simona K. Jankowski: Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there?
Timothy Donald Cook: We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there.
Simona K. Jankowski: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 – 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity?
Timothy Donald Cook: We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive.
Jim Suva: Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yes.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim.

66;AAPL;2017-08-02;"Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2016, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of 2017, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Today we're proud to announce very strong results for our fiscal third quarter, with unit and revenue growth in all of our product categories. We'll review our financial performance in detail, and I'd also like to talk about some of the major announcements we made in June at our Worldwide Developers Conference. It was our biggest and best WWDC ever, and the advances we introduced across hardware, software, and services will help us to delight our customers and extend our competitive lead this fall and well into the future. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $45.4 billion. That's an increase of 7% over last year, so our growth rate has accelerated in three successive quarters this fiscal year. Gross margin was also at the high end of our guidance, and we generated a 17% increase in earnings per share. iPhone results were impressive, with especially strong demand at the high end of our lineup. iPhone 7 was our most popular iPhone, and sales of iPhone 7 Plus were up dramatically compared to iPhone 6s Plus in the June quarter of last year. The combined iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus family was up strong double digits year over year. One decade after the initial iPhone launch, we have now surpassed 1.2 billion cumulative iPhones sold. Services revenue hit an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, representing 22% growth over last year. We continue to see great performance all around the world, with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments. Over the last 12 months, our Services business has become the size of a Fortune 100 company, a milestone we've reached even sooner than we had expected. We had very positive results for iPad, with broad-based growth in units, revenue, and market share. iPad sales were up 15% year over year and grew across all of our geographic segments. We achieved our highest global market share in over four years based on IDC's latest estimate of tablet market results for the June quarter. And in markets like China and Japan, over half of iPads sold were to people buying their very first iPad. Our iPad product lineup is stronger than ever. The new iPad we launched in March offers great value and performance. And the all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, launched in June, features the world's most advanced display with ProMotion technology and is more powerful than most PC desktops. iPad is the perfect tool for teaching in new and compelling ways, and our iPad results were especially strong in the U.S. education market, where sales were up 32% year over year to over 1 million units. We believe that coding is an essential skill that all students should learn. We're thrilled that over 1.2 million students of all ages are now using iPad and Swift Playgrounds to learn the fundamentals of coding. And over 1,000 K-12 schools across the United States plan to use Apple's Everyone Can Code in their curricula this fall. And for high school and community college students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy, we announced app development with Swift, an innovative full-year curriculum designed by Apple engineers and educators and provided free to schools to teach students to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology. I'd like to turn now to Mac, which gained global unit market share and reached new June quarter unit sales records in mainland China and Japan. Mac revenue grew 7% year over year, driven by the strength of the MacBook Pro and iMac despite IDC's latest estimate of a 4% unit contraction in the global PC market. And with the refresh of almost our entire Mac lineup in June, we're off to a great start for the back-to-school season. Sales of Apple Watch were up over 50% in the June quarter, and it's the number one selling smartwatch in the world by a very wide margin. Apple Watch is having a positive impact on people's health and daily lives and motivating them to sit less and move more. With features like built-in GPS and waterproofing, Apple Watch Series 2 is the perfect companion for hiking, running, and swimming. We're also seeing incredible enthusiasm for AirPod, with 98% customer satisfaction based on Creative Strategy's survey. We have increased production capacity for AirPods and are working very hard to get them to customers as quickly as we can, but we are still not able to meet the strong level of demand. We made some big announcements during the June quarter that I'd like to quickly review. We launched a new investment in the future through our Advanced Manufacturing Fund. We've earmarked at least $1 billion for this program, aimed at helping our manufacturing partners develop innovative production capabilities and create high-skill jobs in the United States. We believe this can lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the U.S. The first $200 million from the fund has been committed to Corning to support R&D, capital equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing. And as we announced at WWDC, we have a very exciting fall ahead, with stunning advances in iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, and watchOS4. iOS 11 will make iPhones better than ever with Apple Pay peer-to peer payments, an even more intelligent and natural Siri, new expressive messages with full screen effects, richer and more powerful maps, enhanced live photos and memories and portrait mode effects, and much, much more. iOS 11 will also take the iPad experience to a whole new level, with features such as a customizable dock, Multi-Touch drag and drop, powerful new multitasking, more efficient QuickTime, and great new markup and scanning capabilities. One of the most exciting and most promising announcements from WWDC was the introduction of ARKit, a new set of tools for developers to create augmented reality apps. It's still early in the beta period, but it's clear that ARKit has captured the imagination of our developer community. We think ARKit will help the most creative minds in the industry tap into the latest computer vision technologies to build engaging content. We believe AR has broad mainstream applicability across education, entertainment, interactive gaming, enterprise, and categories we probably haven't even thought of. With hundreds of millions of people actively using iPhone and iPad today, iOS will become the world's biggest augmented reality platform as soon as iOS 11 ships. With iOS 11, we're also bringing the power of machine learning to all Apple developers with Core ML, enabling capabilities like face detection, object tracking, and natural language interpretation. Core ML lets developers incorporate machine learning technologies into their apps with all the processing done right on device, so it respects our customers' data and privacy. For Mac, we provided a peek at the immersive gaming, 3D, and virtual reality experiences made possible with the upcoming release of macOS High Sierra and the amazingly powerful new iMac Pro. We're proud to make the best personal computers in the industry and are very excited to deliver even more innovation in the months to come. Apple Watch will become more intelligent than ever this fall with watchOS4, featuring a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely new music experience. watchOS4 also introduces GymKit, a groundbreaking technology program to connect workouts with cardio equipment. We also previewed HomePod, a breakthrough wireless speaker for the home that delivers amazing audio quality and uses spatial awareness to sense its location in the room and adjust the audio automatically. Visitors to our listening room at WWDC were blown away by the HomePod's incredible sound, which is unlike any other wireless home speaker on the market. With deep knowledge of music, HomePod is designed to work with your Apple Music subscription to help you enjoy the music you already love as well as to discover great new music, based on your personal preferences. As an intelligent home assistant, HomePod is a great way to send messages, set a timer, get updates on news, sports, and weather, or control smart home kit devices by simply asking Siri to turn on the lights, close the shades, or activate a theme. We can't wait to deliver all of these powerful innovations in the months to come. And we might even have some others to share with you later in the year. Now for more details on the June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $45.4 billion, up 7% over last year, an acceleration to the growth rate we reported during the first half of our fiscal year. We achieved these results despite a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis, as currency movements, especially in Europe and China, affected our reported results. Our performance was very strong across the board with growth in all our product categories and almost every market around the world. We achieved double-digit revenue growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Korea, and emerging markets outside of Greater China grew 19% over a year ago. Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.7% of revenue and net income was $8.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, up 17% over last year, and cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion. During the quarter we sold 41 million iPhones and reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units, leaving us with our lowest level of channel inventory in 2.5 years and well within our five-week to seven-week target inventory range. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in most markets we track, with many markets in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East growing unit sales by more than 25%. We are very pleased with these iPhone results, especially considering the tough comparison to the June quarter last year when we launched iPhone SE. iPhone ASP was $606, up from $595 a year ago, thanks to strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which represented a higher percentage of the iPhone mix compared to the Plus model a year ago. The impact of the stronger mix on ASP was partially offset by negative foreign exchange year over year and the reduction in channel inventory, which took place entirely at the high end of the portfolio. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business uses. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone 7 and 99% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone, purchase intention for iPhone was nearly three times the rate of our closest competitor. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone. Turning to Services, we set an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, up 22% year over year. The App Store was a major driver of this performance. And according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be by a wide margin the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Revenue from our Apple Music streaming service and from iCloud storage also grew very strongly. And across all of our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 185 million, an increase of almost 20 million in the last 90 days alone. The reach, usage, and functionality of Apple Pay continue to grow. We launched Apple Pay in Italy in May. And the UAE, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden are scheduled to go live before the end of this calendar year. Apple Pay is by far the number one NFC payment service on mobile devices, with nearly 90% of all transactions globally. Momentum is strongest in international markets, where the infrastructure for mobile payments has developed faster than in the U.S. In fact, three out of four Apple Pay transactions happen outside the U.S. And with the launch of iOS 11 this fall, our users in the U.S. will be able to make and receive person-to-person payments quickly, easily, and securely. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Thanks to great performance from the new MacBook Pro, we generated 7% revenue growth over last year and gained share in the global PC market based on the latest data from IDC. Customer satisfaction for Mac is very strong at 97% in the most recent survey from 451 Research, and our active installed base of Mac has grown double digits over a year ago. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory, and we have a great lineup of Macs for our customers heading into the busy back-to-school season. Turning to iPad, we sold 11.4 million units, up 15% over last year. We were happy to see iPad growth in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit increases in key markets such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, and Greater China. We exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range for iPad channel inventory. NPD indicates that iPad had 55% share of the U.S. tablet market in the month of June, including 8 of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 46% share a year ago. And among tablets priced over $200, iPad's share was 89%. In addition, the most recent survey from 451 Research measured business and consumer satisfaction rates ranging from 95% to 99% across iPad models. And among those planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70%. Our enterprise business continues to expand, and our customers are transforming the way work gets done with iOS and iPad. Walmart will be deploying more than 19,000 iPads for employee training across 50 states, with projections of over 225,000 associates trained on iPad by the end of the year. Initial response from businesses to iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro has been amazing. And companies including Bank of America, Medtronic, and Panera tell us that they will be rolling out the 10.5-inch iPad Pro throughout key areas of their organizations. We're also seeing real traction with our enterprise partners. Just last month, we unveiled the next set of technology announcements in our partnership with Cisco. This new wave adds a whole new category of security features designed to help enterprises and employees defend against growing cyber threats. We believe this investment in our joint security solutions for iOS will make cyber insurance even more attainable for businesses. SAP is making great strides since launching the SAP cloud platform SDK for iOS in March, with a pipeline of hundreds of global opportunities. SAP has also released SuccessFactors Mobile, its first native iOS app for human resources, which will support 47 million iPhone and iPad users worldwide across multiple industries. And our partnership with Deloitte has recently expanded to several more European countries. We're helping clients transform their businesses with iOS. We jointly developed programs such as the Connected Store, a pop-up version of a retail environment, demonstrating iOS tools for sales and demand generation, as well as tailored apps for safe associates, store management, and customers. We also had a tremendous quarter for iPad in education, up 32% year over year. Following the launch of our new iPad in March, an update to our popular Classroom app, and continued enhancements to iOS that make managing iPads in the classroom even easier. The St. Paul Public School District in Minnesota is renewing its One to One program by deploying over 40,000 iPads across every student and teacher in the district. iPad was chosen because of its power and durability, ease of use, multimedia and accessibility features, and the extensive catalog of iOS apps designed specifically for education. The Shawnee Mission School District outside Kansas City recently purchased 19,000 iPads, extending its One to One program started in 2014 thanks to iPad's intuitive interface, superior reliability, and expansive ecosystem of iOS tools for education. It was a very busy quarter for our retail and online stores, which collectively welcomed over 300 million visitors. In addition to our spectacular new store at the Dubai Mall, we opened our first stores in Singapore and in Taiwan during the quarter, expanding our total store footprint to 497 stores. In May, we kicked off Today at Apple, with new in-store programming from music to photography to art and coding. And our stores collectively hosted 87,000 sessions during the quarter. As Tim mentioned last quarter, we have entered a new chapter in retail with unique and rewarding experiences for our customers and some stunning new stores coming in the near future. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $261.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $4.7 billion. $246 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We retired $3.5 billion of debt and issued the equivalent of $10.8 billion in new euro and U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter, including our second green bond, bringing us to $96.4 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We also returned $11.7 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 30.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.6 million shares, and we retired 3.4 million shares upon the completion of our 10th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed $222.9 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $158.5 billion in share repurchases. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $52 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.7 billion and $6.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $500 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on August 17, 2017 to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2017. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Rebecca, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: And that question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, first question for you, gross margin guidance is strong, but it did tick down from your June quarter guidance, and you also narrowed the range to 50 basis points. I wonder if you can just address. What is the driver of the sequential downtick, and what gives you confidence that you have more visibility than you did three months ago?
Luca Maestri: Katy, sequentially from 38.5% that we just reported, typically we have product transition costs during the September quarter. That's the primary driver. This happens fairly regularly for us. We also have a more difficult memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. And we think that we're going to be able to partially offset this with the positive leverage. As you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue. So those are the major puts and takes. In terms of the range that we use for gross margins, we have a fairly good understanding on where we are with our hedging program, and that allows us to mitigate some of the volatility there. So we felt we could guide to a slightly narrower range, which we've done occasionally in the past.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you, and maybe a question for both Tim and Luca. As you outlined on this call and at the Developer Conference in June, there is an unprecedented number of products that either ramped volume or launched in the back half of this year. So appreciating you only formally guide a quarter out, I wonder if there's any qualitative commentary you can provide to help us think about the back half of this calendar year and how all those new products that come into the model could impact either revenue seasonality versus past years or could impact just the costs associated with ramping that many products all at once. Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Katy, as Luca mentioned, we did assume some transitional costs in our guidance for the quarter, as is typically the case. And we're looking very much forward to the product rollouts.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I think obviously, there continues to be strong demand for smartphones. But perhaps mix shift, I think you brought back the iPhone 6 this quarter to be a bit more price aggressive. And then can you just talk a bit about how you see that market developing with the growth of WeChat and some of the other developments that are happening there? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah. Thanks, Shannon. We were very encouraged by the results this quarter. We improved as we thought we would from the previous quarters a little more than I thought we would. If you look underneath the numbers, mainland China was actually flat year-over-year during Q3. And in constant currency terms, we were actually up 6% in mainland China. And so we're very encouraged about that. iPad grew dramatically more than the market. The Mac grew much more than the market. iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year, similar as the market was. And so we see all of those as very encouraging signs. On top of that, Services grew extremely strongly during the quarter. Hong Kong continued to drag down the total Greater China segment. But on a sequential basis, we're probably at the trough of that, which is nice. With the peg to the dollar there from a currency point of view and tourism being what it is, I don't really know when that market will come back. But what we see on the mainland is definitely much more encouraging. It's interesting to note that upgraders both for the quarter and actually for the full fiscal year to-date was our highest ever, and so that we felt very good about. In terms of WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share – because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even greater. And I think that's more the case than the risk that a lot of folks have pointed out. And so I see Tencent as one of our biggest and best developers. They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps and we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.
Shannon S. Cross: Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about the composition of the installed base of iPhones at this point, as obviously we're getting close to a refresh? Just you brought in the iPhone SE. You've obviously had strength at the high end. I'm just trying to think about what percent do you think have upgraded in the prior generation, any color you can give us on that?
Timothy Donald Cook: From an absolute quantity point of view, the upgrades for this fiscal year are the highest that we've seen. And so we feel good about that. However, if you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute number, the rate is similar to what we saw with the previous iPhones, except for iPhone 6, which as we called out in the past had an abnormally high upgrade rate. We do think that based on the amount of rumors and the volume of them that there is some pause in our current numbers. And so where that affects us in the short-term, even though we had great results, it probably bodes well later on.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Thank you. I wonder if you wanted to make any comments about switching this quarter.
Timothy Donald Cook: Sure. Switching outside of China was up year-on-year, and so we're happy with that. We continue to see people moving over to iOS and it helped with us making the results that Luca announced earlier, including the channel inventory reduction.
Steven Milunovich: Okay, and then a government question. First of all, the President suggested that you may build three big beautiful plants. I wonder if you can comment on if that's a possibility either directly or indirectly. And then in China, I think, we all understand that you have to work within the regulations, but maybe you could comment a bit on how you feel your working relationship is with the government and if there is certain lines that you can't cross.
Timothy Donald Cook: Sure. Starting with the U.S., let me just take this question from what are we doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably where it's rooted. We've created 2 million jobs in the U.S., and we're incredibly proud of that. We do view that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, including increasing jobs, because Apple could have only been created here. And so as we look at that 2 million, there are three main categories of that, and we have actions going on in each of them to further build on that momentum. The first category is app development. About three-quarters of the 2 million are app developers. And we're doing an enormous amount of things to deliver curriculum to both K-12 with Swift Playgrounds in the K-to-6 area, other curriculum as you proceed beyond grade 6 under the Everyone Can Code area. And just a couple months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years. And so we're excited about that because we think it could increase the diversity of the developer community and the quantity. And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make because this is the fastest growing job segment in the country, and I think will be for quite some time. If you look at the second area, we have purchased – or we purchased last year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.-based suppliers. Some significant portion of those are manufacturing-related, and so we've asked ourselves what can we do to increase this. And you may have seen that at the beginning of the quarter, sometime in April I believe, we announced a fund, an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, that we're initially placing $1 billion in. And we've already deployed $200 million of that. And the first recipient is Corning in Kentucky, and they'll be using that money to expand the plant to make very innovative glass. And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads. We think there's more of these that we can do. I think there are probably several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time, so we're very excited about that. And then the third area is we have about two-thirds or so of our total employee base is in the U.S. despite only a third of our revenues being here, and we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year. And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view, and we're very, very proud of that. Now turning to China, let me comment on what I assumed is at the root of your question about this VPN issue. Let me just address that head on. The central government in China back in 2015 started tightening the regulations associated with VPN apps, and we have a number of those on our store. Essentially, as a requirement for someone to operate a VPN, they have to have a license from the government there. Earlier this year, they began a renewed effort to enforce that policy, and we were required by the government to remove some of the VPN apps from the App Store that don't meet these new regulations. We understand that those same requirements are on other app stores, and as we checked through that, that is the case. Today there are actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are outside China, and so there continues to be VPN apps available. We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business. And we strongly believe that participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well. And so we believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. And in this particular case, now back to commenting on this one, we're hopeful that over time the restrictions that we're seeing are loosened because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate, and I know that that is a major focus there. And so that's what we're seeing from that point of view. Some folks have tried to link it to the U.S. situation last year, and they're very different. In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us, which was very clear. In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. And like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we'd have to abide by them in both cases, that doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way. We always do that. And so hopefully that's a little bit probably more than you wanted to know, but I wanted to tell you.
Steven Milunovich: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you, a question for Tim maybe on the iPhone install base. At various points in the past you've told us the rate at which that was growing. At the end of the first half, what is that up year on year? At what rate is it growing? Can you give us some sense of that? And on upgrade rates over the longer term, there are lots of moving parts, and I get that there's I guess geographic mix shift of your base. There's many new phones that you may or may not bring out. There's how carriers promote your products. But do you think this upgrade rate is sustainable? Do you think it gets faster all the time? How should we think about the major drivers that you want to see for it? Many thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook: I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base, the product that is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in various markets around the world. And so I think there are many, many factors in that. It's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to or one variable or a couple of variable formula in my opinion. But I think in general, because our installed base was up strong double digit once again, there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us. And between the upgraders and the switchers that we see, and the first-time buyer category is still out there too in several countries, including some that you may not think there is, there's still a sizable base in some. Between those three areas, I think we have a lot of opportunity. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yes.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Kulbinder. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. Luca, typically in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory, like 2 million or 3 million units. You're starting from a very low point at the end of fiscal Q3, as you mentioned on the call, with the drawdown. As we think about what's embedded in your guidance for fiscal Q4 for channel inventory for iPhone, should we be expecting a normal seasonal build, or is it likely to be significantly higher given the very low starting point?
Luca Maestri: As you know, Toni, we do not guide on channel inventory. We've never done that. We are providing a fairly wide range from a revenue standpoint, so obviously that also has an impact on potential channel inventory levels. One thing that I would tell you is that we feel very good about the performance of the business right now. We think that our Services business will continue to grow well. We've got a lot of momentum on iPad and Mac because we refreshed the lineups of those products. Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well. We're getting a lot of positive customer feedback. And I think in general, even the performance in China, Tim has mentioned it. We think that the performance will continue to improve. So those are the drivers of our guidance range for the quarter.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Okay, thanks. Tim, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about two things that you mentioned in public before. One is television, which you have described as an area of intense interest, but I don't even think there was an update on Apple TV on this call. So perhaps you can talk to us about how you're thinking about content. I know you're doing some original content creation, and how that area is evolving in your thinking. And then recently you talked about how Apple is focusing on autonomous systems for automobiles. And there has been press reports that Apple has been testing autonomous vehicles for potentially up to a year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Apple's interest in autonomous vehicles and whether self-driving is really likely to be Apple's principal focus in the near to medium-term.
Timothy Donald Cook: On the first part of your question about original content, we have done some original content. It's focused on Apple Music. Currently, we have some more that's launching in a week or so that will be made available on Apple Music. The objective of this is really twofold. One is for our own learning, given that we're new in the video space in terms of creation. And two is to give the Apple Music subscriber some exclusive content and hopefully grow our subscriber base. And we've recently hired two great folks with lots of experience in creating content like Breaking Bad and The Crown and some really top-notch content. And so we'll see how this area goes, but it is still an area of great interest. In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. From our point of view, autonomy is the mother of all AI projects. And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways and a vehicle is only one. But there are many different areas of it and I don't want to go any further with that. But thank you for the question.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: That comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Michael J. Olson: Good afternoon. I just have one question for Tim. This may be a hard question to answer in a condensed way, but how would you describe what you expect the most near-term applications will be for developers to target using ARKit? Will it be consumer iPhone and iPad applications, enterprise applications, or I guess some combination of the two? And basically, how does this come to market in the most significant way in the next few quarters as Apple becomes the largest global platform for AR as you've talked about? Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Mike, that is a great question. And I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with ARKit in the early going. And to answer your question about what category it starts in, just take a look at what's already on the web in terms of what people are doing and it is all over the place. From entertainment to gaming, I've seen what I would call more small business solutions. I've seen consumer solutions. I've seen enterprise solutions. I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it. So I think that customers are going to see it in a variety of ways. Enterprise takes a little longer sometimes to get going. But I can already tell you there's lots of excitement in there. And I think we'll start to see some applications there as well. And it feels great to get this thing going at a level that can get all of the developers behind it, so I couldn't be more excited about it.
Michael J. Olson: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Amit Daryanani.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess to start off with, on your Services segment, revenues actually I think accelerated by 400 basis points to worse than what you guys had in the first half of this year. Could you just help us understand what's driving this? Is there a way to think about ARPU in a traditional manner within that Services business versus the installed base growing?
Luca Maestri: Amit, Luca. Our Services business is very broad. We've got multiple categories in the Services business, so it's difficult to talk about ARPU in general. It doesn't make a lot of sense. The reason for the acceleration also here is multiple factors. One that is very, very important for us is the fact that the App Store, which is the largest of our Services categories, is seeing an increasingly larger amount of paying accounts. On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well. It is happening for a variety of reasons. One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store. Outside the United States, in many markets, not every form of payment is accepted. We are making it easier all the time. We launched on Alipay, for example, in China during the December quarter. That has obviously helped a lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts. And we continue to bring more and more forms of payment in the App Store around the world. That's a big reason for that. The other reason why the number of paying accounts is growing is the fact that the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve. And so there's many more ways of experiencing games and entertainment and other apps on the store. We have other businesses like the Apple Music streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there. Our iCloud storage business continues to grow very, very fast. So it's multiple services. The number of people transacting on our stores continues to grow. In terms of ARPU, maybe I can make a comment on ARPU specifically related to the App Store. What we're seeing and we've seen over a long period of time as we keep track of these cohorts of customers, we see that as customers get on the App Store and start spending on it, we see the spending profile is very similar across generations of customers. People tend to spend more over time. Obviously, you have different spending profiles in different geographies around the world, but in general you see that trend across the board.
Amit Daryanani: Got it, that's really helpful. And if I could just follow up, on the iPhone side, there's been a large amount of discussion in blogs and among your component suppliers that the timing this time may be somewhat different and delayed versus past. Your guide almost seems you're more excited about this iPhone launch versus historically because the sequential growth is better. So I guess beyond the fact we probably shouldn't read every blog and believe every blog, what do you think is different with this product launch or product availability through the cycle versus what you've seen historically?
Timothy Donald Cook: We have no comment on anything that's unannounced.
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough, I figured it was worth a shot. Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Brian White with Drexel.
Brian J. White: Yes. Tim, growth in the smartphone market is now crawling along at about a low single digit percentage. I know iPhone grew about 2% year over year this quarter, and it looks like you had about a mid-teens market share in units in 2016. So as we look forward maybe three to four years, do you think Apple can expand its unit market share? And if so, what will be the drivers be? And my second question is just about India, general thoughts about India in the quarter. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: The answer to your first question is yes. I do think that we can grow both in units and market share. We don't predict those things, but yes, if you ask me what I think, that's what I think. And so what are the drivers? The installed base is growing. It's still growing very strongly. That will generate more upgrades over time. I feel good about our ability to convince people to switch. And where the developed markets the first-time buyer rates are down other than places like Japan perhaps, the emerging markets, we haven't even gotten started yet, really. From a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there. Emerging markets ex-China were up 18% year on year. It was a record for us, so we see a lot of opportunity in these markets. We are investing in India. As you mentioned in your second point, we've already launched an app accelerator center. That's on top of working with the channel and looking at expanding our go-to-market in general. And we began to produce the iPhone SE there during the quarter, and we're really happy with how that's going. And so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there. I see a lot of similarities to where China was several years ago. And so I'm very, very bullish and very, very optimistic about India.
Brian J. White: Great, thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks very much, Brian. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

67;AAPL;2017-11-03;"Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, and after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy D. Cook: Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we closed the books on a very successful fiscal 2017, I have to say I couldn't be more excited about Apple's future. This was our biggest year ever in most parts of the world with all-time record revenue in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Korea, the Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia. We had particularly strong finish this year, generating our highest September quarter revenue ever as year-over-year growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Revenue was $52.6 billion, above the high end of our guidance range, and up 12% over last year. We generated revenue growth across all of our product categories and showed all-time record results for our Services business. As we expected, we returned to growth in greater China, with unit growth and market share gains for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In fact, it was an all-time record quarter for Mac sales in mainland China as well as an all-time high for Services revenue. And revenue from emerging markets outside of greater China was up 40%, with great momentum in India, where revenue doubled year over year. We also had great results in enterprise and education with double digit growth in worldwide customer purchases of iPad and Mac in both markets. Gross margin for the September quarter was at the high end of our guidance range, and thanks to exceptional work by our teams, we generated record fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.07, up 24% from a year ago. iPhone sales exceeded our expectations. In the last week and a half of September, we began shipping iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to customers in more than 50 countries. They instantly became our two most popular iPhone models and have been every week since then. As we speak, the launch of iPhone X is now underway as stores open across Australia and Asia. iPhone X is packed with innovative new technologies that chart our path for the next decade, technologies like the TrueDepth camera system, Super Retina Display, and A11 Bionic chip with neural engine, which has been in development for years with a focus on deep machine learning. iPhone X enables totally new experiences like unlocking your iPhone with Face ID, taking photos with studio-quality lighting effects, or playing immersive augmented reality games. We can't wait for people to experience our vision of the future. Orders have already been very strong, and we're working to get iPhone X into customers' hands as quickly as possible. Turning to Services. Revenue reached an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion in the September quarter. A few quarters ago, we established a goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue of $24 billion by the year 2020, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. In fiscal 2017, we reached $30 billion, making our Services business already the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're also delighted to report our second consecutive quarter of double-digit unit growth for iPad. Customers have responded very positively to the new iPad lineup. And with the launch of iOS 11, the iPad experience has become more powerful than ever, with great new features for getting things done like the new dock, Files app, drag and drop, multitasking and more power than most PC notebooks. The launch of iOS 11 also made iOS the world's largest platform for augmented reality. There are already over 1,000 apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today, with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of apps aimed at consumers, students and business users alike. Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We're already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that let you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine, from the human body to the solar system. And of course, you experience them like they're really there. Instantly, education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase, or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything. iOS 11 is also allowing developers to integrate machine learning models into their apps with Core ML. Pinterest is already using Core ML to deliver fast and powerful visual search. PadMapper uses Core ML to provide intelligent features that make it easy to find or rent your apartment. And VisualDx is even pioneering new health diagnostics with Core ML, automating skin image analysis to assist dermatologists with their diagnoses. These are just a few examples. There's so much more to come. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which had its best year ever, with the highest annual Mac revenue in Apple's history. It was also the best September quarter ever, with Mac revenue growth of 25% driven by the notebook refreshes we launched in June and a strong back-to-school season. The Mac experience has become even better since the September launch of macOS High Sierra, with new technologies to make Mac more reliable, capable and responsive and lay the foundation for future innovation. Moving on now to Apple Watch. With unit growth of over 50% for the third consecutive quarter, it continues to be the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world. We began shipping Apple Watch Series 3 just six weeks ago and customers love the new freedom of cellular. The ability to go for a run with just your Apple Watch or go for a quick errand without your phone while staying connected is a game changer. Now more than ever, Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life and is already making a big difference in our customers' lives. We're very excited about the upcoming launch of the Apple Heart Study, which will use data from Apple Watch to identify irregular heart rhythms and notify users when unusual patterns are detected. Earlier this week, we introduced watchOS 4.1, bringing 40 million songs to your wrist through Apple Music. The combination of music streaming on Apple Watch and AirPods is truly a magical experience for people on the go. We're thrilled with the momentum of these products. In fact, our entire wearables business was up 75% year over year in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2017, already generated the annual revenue of a Fortune 400 company. Late in the September quarter, we also launched Apple TV 4K, delivering a stunning cinematic experience at home. So now users around the world can watch movies and shows in 4K HDR quality and stream live sports and news on the Apple TV app. There's already a great selection of 4K HDR titles available through iTunes and other popular video services with many more movies and shows on the way. We're also very excited about the opening of Apple Michigan Avenue two weeks ago on Chicago's riverfront. This is the first store that brings together our complete vision for the future of Apple retail, providing a welcoming place for everyone to experience our products, services and inspiring educational programs right in the heart of their city. In addition to our very popular Today at Apple programming, which is available in all Apple Stores around the world, offering daily sessions in photography, music creation, art and design, coding and entrepreneurship, Apple Michigan Avenue is partnering with local nonprofits and creative organizations to make an ongoing positive impact in that community. Also this quarter, we expanded our free App Development with Swift curriculum to more than 30 community colleges across the country. We're very excited about this initiative, and we're thrilled by the momentum we're seeing. The schools we've launched with this summer are just the beginning. Community colleges have a powerful reach into communities where education is the great equalizer, and the colleges adopting our curriculum this academic year are providing opportunity to millions of students to build apps that will prepare them for careers in software development and information technology and much more. We're incredibly enthusiastic about what our teams have accomplished this year and all the amazing products in our lineup. As we approach the holiday season, we expect it to be our biggest quarter ever. I'd like to thank all of our teams, our partners and our customers for their passion, commitment and loyalty. You've helped us make 2017 a sensational year. Now for more details on the September quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was a record $52.6 billion, up 12% over last year, and it has been great to see our growth rate accelerate in every quarter of fiscal 2017. Our terrific performance this quarter was very broad based, with revenue growth in all our product categories for the second quarter in a row and new September quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia-Pacific segments. We grew double digits in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Korea and several other developed markets. We were especially happy to return to growth in greater China, where revenue was up 12% from a year ago and with our momentum in India, where revenue doubled year-over-year. We grew more than 30% in Mexico, the Middle East, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. These results have fueled overall growth of over 20% from emerging markets. Gross margin was 37.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 25% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.07, up 24% over last year to a new September quarter record and cash flow from operations was strong at $15.7 billion. During the quarter, we sold 46.7 million iPhones, up 3% over last year. We were very pleased to see double digit iPhone growth in many emerging markets including mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India and Mexico. We gained share not only in those markets but also in Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Singapore, based on the latest estimates from IDC. iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.3 million units sequentially to support the launch of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, significantly less than the increase in the September quarter a year ago. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a customer satisfaction rating of 97% or higher across all iPhone models. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone in the next 90 days, purchase intention for iPhone was 69%, more than 5 times the rate of the closest competitor with a loyalty rate for current iPhone owners of 95% compared to 53% for the next highest brand. For corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 95% and of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% planned to purchase iPhone. That is the highest score for iPhone in the history of the survey. Turning to Services, we set an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion, up 34% year over year. Our results included a favorable one-time revenue adjustment of $640 million. On a run rate basis, excluding this adjustment, services growth of 24% was terrific and the highest that we have experienced this year. The App Store set a new all-time record, and according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a wide and growing margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. We're getting great response to the App Store's new design in iOS 11 from both customers and developers. We're seeing increases in the frequency of customer visits, the amount of time they spend in the store and the number of apps they download. The success of Apple Music also continues to build and we're seeing our highest conversion rates from customers trying the service. Revenue grew strongly once again in the September quarter and the number of paid subscribers was up over 75% year-over-year. We also saw great performance from our iCloud business with very strong double-digit growth in both monthly average users and revenue. Across all of our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 210 million at the end of September quarter, an increase of 25 million in the last 90 days. Apple Pay expanded to Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UAE last month and continues to grow rapidly. Over the past year, active users have more than doubled and annual transactions are up 330%. In the U.S., 70% of leading grocery chains are now accepting Apple Pay with the recent launch of Safeway and over 5 million U.S. merchant locations will be Apple Pay enabled by the end of this year. Next, I would like to talk about the Mac, which for fiscal 2017 set a new all-time revenue record of $25.8 billion. We sold 5.4 million Macs during the September quarter, up 10% over last year and gained significant market share as the global market contracted by 1% based on IDC's latest estimate. This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro and Mac revenue grew 25% to a new September quarter record. We had outstanding results all around the world with each of our geographic segments growing Mac revenue by 20% or more. We were also very happy with the success of Mac in the education market where customer purchases grew double digits year over year. It was also another great quarter for iPad. We sold 10.3 million units, up 11% over last year with strong demand for both iPad and iPad Pro and revenue grew 14%. It was great to see iPad unit and revenue growth in all of our geographic segments and particularly strong results in emerging markets, including greater China, where iPad units sales were up 25% year-over-year and India, which grew 39%. NPD indicates that iPad had 54% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, including seven of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 47% share a year ago. Also, the most recent surveys from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction rates of 97% across iPad models. And among people planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70% for both consumers and businesses. We are seeing great momentum with our enterprise initiatives. During the September quarter, we announced a new partnership with Accenture, who is creating a dedicated iOS practice in select locations around the world. Experts from Apple are co-locating with this team and together they'll be launching new tools and services that help enterprise clients transform how they engage with customers using iPhone and iPad. Examples include services to build new customer experiences and to facilitate iOS integration with enterprise systems to help businesses take greater advantage of data from Internet of Things platforms and to enable the smooth transfer of existing legacy applications and data to modern iOS apps. And last month, we announced a partnership with GE to reinvent the way industrial companies work by bringing GE's industrial IoT platform to iOS. The (20:37) SDK for iOS will enable developers to build native apps to drive industrial operations with more efficiency and speed than ever before. GE is also standardizing on iPhone and iPad for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees and working with Apple, GE is developing iOS apps for both its internal and external audiences to bring predictive data and analytics to workers across a broad range of industries. Beyond our iOS devices, we are also seeing great traction for Mac in the enterprise market with all-time record customer purchases in fiscal year 2017. The September quarter was very strong for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 418 million visitors. Traffic was particularly heavy during the week of our new product announcements, up 19% over last year. Retail ran a very successful back-to-school promotion in the Americas, Europe, China and Singapore, with sales of Mac and iPad Pro up strong double digits compared to last year's program. And around the world, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions during the quarter. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $268.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $7.4 billion. $252.3 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in new Canadian and U.S. dollar denominated debt during the quarter, bringing us to $104 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We also returned $11 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 29.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.1 million shares and we retire 4.5 million shares upon the completion of our 11th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed almost $234 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $166 billion in share repurchases. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, the December quarter in fiscal 2017 spanned 14 weeks, whereas the December quarter this year will include the usual 13 weeks. We expect revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.65 billion and $7.75 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $600 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2017, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2017. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please?
Operator: First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Luca, when do you expect to catch up with iPhone X demand? And given it's likely to be not in the December quarter, should we think about March as a better than seasonal revenue quarter because of that iPhone X ramp? And then I have a follow-up.
Timothy D. Cook: I'll take that, Katy. It's Tim. The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it. And so we're really happy that we were able to increase week by week what we're outputting and we're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible. I can't predict, at this point, when that balance will happen. And in terms of March, we obviously don't give guidance beyond the current quarter.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Okay. And then China growth returned to strong double digits, 12% up. You've talked historically about that region being more sensitive than others to form factor changes and the new iPhone X form factor was not available in September. And so should we assume that growth in that region only accelerates from here as that new product gets pushed into the market.
Timothy D. Cook: Let me talk a little bit about Q4 in China to give you a little bit of color on the results. We increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the quarter. We hit all-time revenue records for Services and for Mac for the PRC during the quarter. We've had very strong iPad revenue growth. We had double digit unit growth in iPhone and both the upgraders and Android switchers were both up on a year over year basis during the quarter, and so the results were broad based. They were pretty much across the board, as I indicated. The other thing that's happened is that the decline that we've been experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. And so it's still down year over year but less so than it was and part of that is the compare is an easier compare. And then finally, in terms of another headwind that is a little less than it was, currency has been affecting us more significantly. Last quarter in China, it affected us 1 percentage point. And so the sum of all that, I feel great about the results. We don't obviously provide geographic-specific guidance but you can see from our overall guidance, we think we're going to have a really strong quarter.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Piper Jaffray, Mike Olson.
Michael J. Olson: Good afternoon and congrats on a strong quarter. Is there any information you can provide on how iPhone X pre-orders compared to what you saw with iPhone 8 pre-orders? And then I have a follow-up as well.
Timothy D. Cook: Michael, we never go through mix, but I would share with you that the iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for our channel partners, which as you know, are lots of carriers throughout the world. And we couldn't be more excited to get underway. And I think as of a few minutes ago, the first sales started in Australia. And I'm told we had several hundred people waiting at the store in Sydney and I'm getting similar reports from across that region.
Michael J. Olson: All right. Thanks. And we're excited about augmented reality and from your perspective, and maybe from our perspective on the outside looking in, how do we gauge the success of AR and what are some of the applications of the technology that you're most excited about today? Thanks.
Timothy D. Cook: Yes, it's a great question. The reason I'm so excited about AR is I view that it amplifies human performance instead of isolates humans. And so as you know, it's the mix of the virtual and the physical world and so it should be a help for humanity, not an isolation kind of thing for humanity. As I go through different countries as I've been traveling lately, and looking at some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place. I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping. I see things that consumers will love on the gaming side and the entertainment side. I see business-related AR apps as well. They're going to be great for productivity and between small and large business. And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot. And so the real beauty here is that it's mainstream. And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this because it requires both hardware and software integration, and it requires sort of making a lot of – or giving the operating system update to many people at once. And the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight. And so there's 1,000-plus in the App Store right now. I think this is very much like in 2008, when we fired the gun in the overall App Store. And so that's what it feels like to me, and I think it will just get bigger from here.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you very much. A couple questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking in terms of the lineup? You go from $340 – this is for iPhone – you go from $349 to above $1,000. And it appears that you probably sold a fair amount at the lower end. Perhaps that was just some of the switchers in China and maybe drove some of the growth in China in terms of market share. But how are you sort of thinking about what went into the guidance for the December quarter? Are you seeing really strong demand at the low end and obviously expected benefit from the X at the high end? I'm just trying to understand because you have such a broader lineup than you've had in prior years.
Timothy D. Cook: Yes. In terms of what we saw in Q4, you can probably tell from the ASP we had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones. And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone but may have a more limited budget. And we've got some iPhones that are really great for that market. And then we've got three new iPhones and people will look at these and decide which one they want. And this is the first time we've ever been in the position that we've had three new iPhones at once like this at the top end of the line. And it's the first time we've had a staggered launch. And so we're going to see what happens, but we put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that Luca presented, and you can tell from that, that we're bullish.
Shannon S. Cross: Great. Thank you. And then in terms of Services, $8.5 billion, up 34%, can you talk about some of the portions of that that outperformed, how sustainable? You mentioned China in terms of significant growth in Services, but I'm just curious. That's a pretty remarkable number, so I'm curious what the drivers were. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Shannon. It's Luca. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was a $640 million adjustment and there was a one-off change. And it's important to call it out because of course it's a one-off. And so the underlying growth rate for service in the quarter was fantastic. It was 24%. It's the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal 2017. So the business is going incredibly well. I would highlight maybe three of these businesses within Services at the App Store set a new all-time record. It's going incredibly well. The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business. Apple Music was up, subscriptions were up 75% year over year. We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. And so we turned the corner in Music. You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in Music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. And that really helps the growth rate for the entire Services business. iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. So we already become the size of a Fortune 100 company. We set a goal for ourselves to double what we did in fiscal 2016, and the trajectory is actually quite positive.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Thank you. I wanted to try to push a little bit more on the mix. Could you comment whether the 8 Plus outsold the 8 in the quarter? There seems to be some data that suggests that. And the 451 Research survey that you're alluding to also finds that over the next 90 days, those buying an iPhone, 43% are planning on buying the X. Could you comment upon your expectations in terms of the mix going forward? And if you won't do that, perhaps you could comment a bit about your thinking in terms of pushing price elasticity. I think a couple years ago, nobody would've imagined selling a phone at this price and obviously, you're pretty confident that you can do it.
Timothy D. Cook: Obviously, I'm not going to talk about mix. That's something that we've done in the past. If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top two selling products. If you look at 8 Plus in particular, to provide a little color there, 8 Plus for the period of time that we can measure to date, has gotten off to the fastest start of any Plus model. That for us was a bit of a surprise, and a positive surprise, obviously. And so we'll see what happens next. As I've mentioned before, we've never had three products and it's only today that the first customers can sort of look at all three of those and I'm sure there's been some people that wanted to do that before deciding even which one. And so we'll see what happens there. But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to go out on just the U.S., since that tends to be more of the focus of this call, you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. And so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a week. It's let's say less than a coffee a day at one of these nice coffee places. The other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their current iPhone on the next iPhone. And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone and so that even reduces the monthly payment less. And then obviously, some carriers also have promotional things going on. And so I do think it's important to try to place it in that context. In terms of the way we price, we price to sort of the value that we're providing. We're not trying to charge the highest price we could get or anything like that. We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering. And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands.
Steven Milunovich: And then I wanted ask, the Street historically has been a little skeptical about continued innovation and you've suggested there is more to go. Historically, you weren't first to large screens, you weren't first to OLED. Now though, you're leading in AR, you're leading with face ID, which the all-in a year ago, as some of your guys have suggested, was kind of very reminiscent of the aggressive Apple. Is it possible going forward that you could accelerate share gains from Android because you're now in a stronger competitive position?
Timothy D. Cook: I think, Steve, we've been in a competitive position. And so I probably maybe have a different view than you do or the folks that you're quoting. There's always doubting Thomases out there. And I've been hearing those for the 20 years I've been here and suspect I'll hear about them until I retire, right. So I don't really listen to that too much. There's lots of fantastic people here and they're doing unbelievable things. And yes, I view AR as profound. Not today, not the app that you'll see on the App Store today, but what it will be, what it can be. I think it's profound and I think Apple is in a really unique position to lead in this area.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. Just following up a little bit on that question, Tim. You talked a bit about providing a lot of value and that Apple sets its prices according to value. And I think given the uniqueness of the product you have with the iPhone X in particular, that makes a lot of sense. I guess the question is given the uniqueness of the value that you have in the marketplace, why shouldn't we – should we, or why shouldn't we expect gross margins to improve this cycle versus previous ones? And perhaps you can talk a little bit about how you think about pricing in the context of gross margin. And I have a follow-up, please.
Luca Maestri: Toni, I'll take that one. When – you said we price our products for the value that we deliver. We also said that every time we launch new products, the cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It's inevitable. We are adding new technologies, new features, and therefore the cost structures go up. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down. There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and there are also elements that we don't control. Take for example foreign exchange, which has been a significant headwind for the company for the last three years now. Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time, and that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. There are situations where the commodities markets are in good shape. There are situations where commodity markets can be a bit out of balance. We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being. So there's many puts and takes. The fact that our Services business is growing, it should be a positive because our Services margins tend to be accretive to company margins. So there's many puts and takes. We tend to think about maximizing gross margin dollars because we think that's the most important thing for investors at the end of the day. When we look at our track record over years, I think we've found a good balance between unit grow and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to do that as we go forward.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to revisit this notion of supply and demand, and I realize it's very early and you can't make predictions. I think a common investor question is, the iPhone X was made available for sale. It quickly had pushed out availability levels to unprecedented levels versus history. And so I think the really significant question is, is that initial push-out really a function of uniquely strong demand versus history or is that push-out in availability really a function of much weaker supply versus history? So it'd be really helpful. You have in the past commented on first 24-hour orders, for which there were 4 million plus for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You have very often on this call talked about targeting when you think you could reach supply/demand balance. So it'd be really helpful if you could provide some context in terms of what you know, either about initial orders or about a supplies versus history that can help investors try and better understand the little data points that they're seeing in terms of availability of the device. Thank you.
Timothy D. Cook: The truth is we don't know. We've put our best estimate into the guidance, and you can see from the guidance that we are very bullish. And so, and we feel really great about the product lineup. We just sold the first units minutes ago. And so we'll see how things go. Until you get all of them out there where customers have the ability to demo and support, I think any kind of mix discussion is very much estimating. And so we put our best estimates in, but grantedly, we've never done this before. So there's no comparison here, with either the three iPhones nor the staggered launch. So we're going to learn something.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: That is Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thanks very much. And I'll ask my original question and follow-up at the same time because they're slightly different topics. But you'd mentioned great success in India. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned, I think, India doubled year over year. Based upon market analysis, it looks like Apple's still just a relatively small sliver of the pie there. So Tim, what would it take be even more successful in India? Is it a manufacturing footprint there? Is it partners? Is it more physical stores? Is it lower price points? Is it the bandwidth that has now caught up to many other countries, or how should we think about that? And then the follow-up question is on the AR/VR, where will it really show up in your income statement? Are you hoping more for hardware sales or services through the apps or where the excitement will then monetize it within Apple? Thank you.
Timothy D. Cook: In terms of India, many of the things that you mentioned are correct. Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well. And so it's analogous to the many years that we put into China. It's building stores. It's building channels. It's building markets. It's building the developer ecosystem. It's having the right product lineup for the market. And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go, which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. And I do feel great about the growth rate. And so that's India. I think it's all of those things. As you know, as I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing the iPhone SE there six, nine months ago so. And the majority of the iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. And so we also have that going and are hoping that that winds up saving some amount of money over time and avoiding some of the compounding of taxes, et cetera. The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed and between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago. So there's been a sea change there in a short period of time. So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go. In terms of the monetization question on AR/VR, we tend to focus first and foremost on customer experience. And so we're all about making sure the experience is great. And we think that if we get the experience right, that revenues and profits will be a result of getting that right. And so we're very much focused on the experience right now.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much for your details. Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets,
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I have two as well. I guess maybe to start with on gross margins. Luca, year over year revenues are going to be up high single digits at the midpoint, gross margin will be down a little. Could you just tell us what are the puts and takes on that? And are yield inefficiencies broadly much more severe this time versus what you've seen historically?
Luca Maestri: Yes. Amit, so we're guiding 38% to 38.5%. That's up 35 bps sequentially. Obviously we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes. As I mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a headwind at this point. Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year over year basis. So they are meaningful impacts, and I think that is what I think probably you're referring to.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess if I could just follow up on the Services line. I mean you guys talked about it a fair amount earlier, but even if you exclude the one-time gain, it looks like the back half of 2017 accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal 2017 versus the first half of 2017. Qualitatively or quantitatively, is there a way to think about how much of this is from expanding of the installed base, which is one of the three things you mentioned I think, versus more dollar per iOS device that you see?
Luca Maestri: Yes. I think it's both. As I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot. It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier for our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able to transact on the App Store. We are accepting, for example, more forms of payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago. So that's been very important. We also see that there is a typical spending curve for our customers. When they start transacting on the Store, they start at a certain level and they tend over time to get more familiar with the Store and they start to spend more. We're also now, very recently, made some changes, as you probably have seen, to the design of the App Store. And I was mentioning to you in the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very favorably. And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they download more apps, and that over time translates into monetization. But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating. I mentioned Music. I mentioned iCloud, and so it all adds up. And as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: From Drexel Hamilton, Brian White.
Brian J. White: Yeah, Tim, I'm wondering if we take a look at mainland China and we think about iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, they've been on sale for a while now. What has been the just general response to those two new iPhones and also preorders around the iPhone X in mainland China?
Timothy D. Cook: Brian, I hate to repeat this, but we don't really disclose mix. We view it as competitive information that we want to hold tightly ourselves. In terms of the way the preorder process works in China in the channel, so not in our direct channel, but in the broader carrier channel and channel, they generally take indications of interest versus something that I would label a preorder. And so I would hesitate to even quote a number for fear it could be misconstrued. And we'll find out what the demand and where the supply and demand meet sometime in the future. I don't know when yet, but we're really excited to get going to find out.
Brian J. White: And, Tim, it's interesting that sales grew 16% sequentially. If you look at the past five years, sales were up 7% in the September quarter, so that's an average. Yet you didn't have all your iPhones in the market. So if you had to, what would you attribute that to? It's a pretty big disconnect, 16% versus an average of 7%.
Timothy D. Cook: Our emerging market performance during the quarter was very strong. And if you take China out, it's even stronger. But you can see that China rebounded. And as I'd indicated before, the China rebound was broad based across the products. And so we just had a phenomenal quarter on iPad, on the Mac, on Services, on Apple Watch, on iPhone. I mean we're literally, we're firing on all cylinders. And so that's what, that and our new products give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Brian.
Brian J. White: And, Tim -

68;AAPL;2018-02-02;"Operator: Good day. And welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook and he’ll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we’ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocations and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. And I'd like to remind that the quarter we’re reporting today included 13-weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14-weeks. And I’d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Nancy and thanks everyone on the call, and welcome to everyone today. Before we dive into the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to talk about a significant milestone we recently crossed. Apple's active installed base reached 1.3 billion devices in January and is at an all-time high for all of our major products. 1.3 billion devices represents an astonishing 30% growth in just two years. It speaks to the strength and reliability of our products and our ecosystem, as well as the loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. It's also fueling tremendous growth in our services business, which I’ll talk about a little later in the call. Turning to the December quarter. We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $88.3 billion, which is above the high-end of our guidance range, and it is up almost $10 billion or 13% over the previous all-time record we set a year ago. It's also our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth with double digit growth in each of our geographic segments around the world. What makes us even more remarkable is that the quarter we're reporting today was 13-weeks long, while the year ago quarter was 14-weeks. When we look at the average revenue per week in the December quarter this year compared to last year, our growth was a stunning 21%. Our growth was broad-based and a key driver was iPhone, which generated its highest revenue ever. iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world in the December quarter according to Canalys, and it has been our top selling phone every week since it launched. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus rounded out the top three iPhones in the quarter. In fact, revenue for our newly launched iPhones was the highest of any lineup in our history, driving total Apple revenue above our guidance range. I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into creating iPhone X. Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development; one that introduced innovative features like an edge-to-edge Super Retina Display and the TrueDepth Camera, which enables Face ID. Our customers love these new features and the new gestures like simply swiping up from the bottom, which make using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable. Our team has put the technology of tomorrow in our customers’ hands today, set a standard for the next decade of smartphones and we are very proud of their achievements. It was another very strong quarter for services with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% over last year, and we’re on pace to achieve our goal of doubling our 2016 services revenue by 2020. The number of paid subscriptions across our services offerings passed 240 million by the end of the December quarter, that’s an increase of 30 million in the last 90 days alone, which is the largest quarterly growth ever. We had an all-time record quarter for the App Store with our best holiday season ever. We’re seeing great excitement around augmented reality with customers now enjoying over 2,000 ARKit enabled app, spanning every category in the App Store. In December, when Pokémon GO released its new augmented reality features built with ARKit, it jumped the top of the App Store charts. Last week, on a stop in Toronto, I met developers who are hard at work on creative applications using ARKit from art appreciation to ecommerce, and I was very impressed with what I saw. Just four months after ARKit launched to the public, we’ve already released ARKit 1.5 in beta to developers around the world, and the response has been tremendous. Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices. And with ARKit, we’re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do. In addition to the App Store, several other services had a biggest quarter ever, including Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay, all of which saw growth in both active users and revenue. Apple Pay has reached an important milestone in the U.S. As a result of 50% year-over-year growth in merchant adoption, it’s now accepted at more than half of all American retail locations, which includes more than two-thirds of the country’s top 100 retailers. Now available in 20 markets, global Apple Pay purchase volume more than tripled year-over-year and we’re delighted to be expanding to Brazil in the coming months. Today, you can use Apple Pay to take a subway in Guangzhou, China, see a concert at London’s Wembley Stadium or buy a souvenir in Yosemite National Park. In the U.S., we launched Apple Pay Cash in December, and it’s off to a terrific start. Millions of people are already using it to send and receive money with friends and family quickly, easily and securely; to split a bill, pay someone back, or send last minute gift right from the messages app. It was our best quarter ever for the Apple Watch with over 50% growth in revenue and units for the fourth quarter in a row and strong double-digit growth in every geographic segment. Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year ago. Apple Watch is the most popular, smart watch in the world and gained market share during the quarter based on the latest estimates from IDC. It was the third consecutive quarter of growth for iPad revenue, thanks to the strength of both iPad and iPad Pro. Based on the latest data from IDC, we gained share in nearly every market we track with strong outperformance in emerging markets. Worldwide, almost half of our iPad sales were the first-time tablet buyers or those switching to Apple, and that’s true in some of our most developed markets, including Japan and France. In China, new and switching users made up over 70% of all iPad sales. For Mac, we launched the all new, iMac Pro in mid-December. It’s an entirely new product line designed for our Pro users who love the all-in-one design of iMac and require workstation class performance. It's the fastest, most powerful Mac ever, delivering incredible computational power, for simulation and real time 3D rendering, immersive VR and complex photography audio and video projects. Worldwide, 60% of our Mac sales were to first time buyers and switchers and in China, that number was almost 90%. We're looking forward to getting HomePod in customers’ hands beginning next week. HomePod is an innovative wireless speaker, which delivers stunning audio quality wherever its placed in the home, thanks to the advanced Apple engineered hardware and software. Together with Apple Music, HomePod gives you instant access to one of the world's largest music catalogs. And with the intelligence of Siri, it’s a powerful assistant you control through natural voice interaction. We're very happy with the initial response from reviewers who've experienced HomePod ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new product. We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education. And because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into initiatives like everyone can code. To find the innovators of the future, we need to nurture the students of today. Our App Development with Swift curriculum, which is available free on iBooks, has been downloaded more than 1.2 million times worldwide with almost half of those coming from here in the United States. It’s also being taught in dozens of community colleges across the country, putting practical skills in the hands of today’s jobs seekers. I was in London two weeks ago as we announced that the program was expanding to more than 70 colleges and universities in Europe. Millions of students around the world will have the opportunity to add Swift to their coding vocabulary and gain skills that are essential for today’s economy. This is an exciting time at Apple and with the best lineup of products and services we've ever had and a set of initiatives that show how business can be a force for good in the world. We could not be more excited about our future. Now, for more details on the December quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional, as we set new all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Starting with revenue, we’re reporting an all-time record, $88.3 billion, up nearly $10 billion or 13% over the prior record set last year. It is our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. As you know, the December quarter a year ago spanned 14-weeks compared to 13-weeks this year, which is important to consider as we assess the underlying performance of our business this year. When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter. Our results were terrific all around the world with double digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments, an all-time quarterly record in the vast majority of markets we track, including the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada Australia and Korea, as well as Mainland China, Latin America, The Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, and India. In Greater China, we were very happy to generate double digit revenue growth for the second quarter in a row and in emerging markets outside of Greater China, we saw 25% year-over-year growth. Gross margin was 38.4% at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue. Our net income was $20.1 billion an all-time record, and up $2.2 billion over the last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.89 also an all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong of $28.3 billion. During the quarter, we sold 77.3 million iPhones, the highest number ever for a 13-week quarter. Average weekly iPhone sales were up 6% compared to December quarter last year with growth in every region of the world despite the staggered launch of iPhone X. We established all-time iPhone revenue record in nearly every market we track with double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments. iPhone ASP increased to $796 from $695 a year ago, driven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users. The latest data from 451 Research indicates U.S. customer satisfaction ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models. In fact, combining iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, consumers reported an amazing 99% satisfaction rating. And among business customers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 77% planned to purchase iPhone. Our customers are also incredibly loyal with Comcast latest U.S. research, reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured. Turning to services. We had a terrific quarter with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week; that is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter. The App Store set a new all-time revenue record. The Store’s all-new design is off to a fantastic start with quarterly store visitors, transacting accounts and paying accounts, reaching new all-time highs. During the week beginning December 24th, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded Apps from the App Store, spending over $890 million in that seven-day period, followed by $300 million in purchases on New Year’s day alone. And according to App Annie’s latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Across all our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached $240 million with growth of 58% over last year and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in services revenue. As Tim mentioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch. And when we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from wearables was up almost 70% year-over-year. In fact, wearables were the second largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only three years ago. In total, our other products category set a new all-time record with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for the first time. Next, I’d like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week. Mac performance was particularly strong in emerging markets with unit sales up 13% year-over-year and with all-time records in Latin America, in India, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. On a worldwide basis, the active install base of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new record. It was also another growth quarter for iPad. We sold 13.2 million units with average iPad sales per week up 8% over last year’s December quarter. iPad sales grew strong double-digits in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and India, as well as developed markets, including Japan, Australia and Korea. The active install base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new all-time high in December, thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users. NPD indicates that iPad had 46% share of the U.S. tablet market in the December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago. And the most recent surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business users planned to purchase iPads. Customer satisfaction is also very high with businesses reporting a 99% satisfaction rating for iPad. We are seeing great traction in enterprise as businesses across industries and around the world standardize on iOS. For example, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Europe’s leading banks, has chosen iOS as the mobile standard for its entire 70,000 employee base in Italy; choosing iOS for its security, user interface, accessibility and reliability, Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps to improve employee productivity in customer support, human resources, and marketing across the company. And LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital optical measurements in a personalized and interactive experience. We’re also rolling out a new initiative, called Apple at Work to help businesses implement employee choice programs more easily and offer Apple products company-wide. Resources from both Apple and our channel partners will enable enterprise IT and procurement teams to buy or lease Apple products more efficiently, streamline the setup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and deliver a seamless onboarding experience for employees. We launched the program with CDW in the U.S. last week, and we would be expanding to more channels and regions later this year. The December quarter was extremely busy for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 538 million visitors. Traffic was particularly strong during the four-weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year. And across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions, covering topics including photography, music, gaming, and app development, and art and design. Just last weekend, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea and we’re looking forward to opening our first store in Austria in a few weeks. These newest openings will mark the expansion of our retail store presence to 21 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $285.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $16.2 billion. $269 billion of this cash, or 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $110 billion in term-debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a total net cash position of $163 billion at the end of the quarter. We also returned $14.5 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and spent $5.1 billion on repurchases of 30.2 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a new $5 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 23.6 million shares and we retired 3.8 million shares upon the completion of our 12th ASR during the quarter. We’ve now completed over $248 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $176 billion in share repurchases against our announced $210 billion buyback program with $34 billion remaining under our current authorization. Turning to taxes. Due to the recently enacted legislation in the U.S., we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion to the U.S. government on our cumulative past foreign earnings. This amount is very similar to what we had been accruing on those earnings in our financial results through fiscal year 2017. Including the $38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our total domestic and foreign earnings during the last 10 years for a cash tax rate of about 26%. Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance of 25.5% as the lower U.S. statutory rate from the new legislation was effectively offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call; we expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion; we expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%; we expect OpEx to be between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion; we expect OI&E to be about $300 million; and we expect the tax rate to be about 15%. Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion. And given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of updates that we have provided in the past. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018. With that, I’d like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Luca, I wanted to talk a little bit about, more about your comments on capital structure. I realize you don't want to give any specifics about what you're actually going to return in the timing. But just maybe if you can talk about how much cash you think you need to have here on the business? And then in terms of ongoing cash flow, since toe overseas cash flow no longer be encumbered, does that change your thought process, in general? And then I have a follow up. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Of course, we've been talking about the importance of tax reform over the years, because we believe it's really beneficial to the U.S. economy. What it means to us as a company of course is that, we have additional flexibility right now from the access to the foreign cash. And in the past, we've been addressing this issue by having to raise debt as the cash was overseas; the majority of the cash was overseas. And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash, we've got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion. We have now the flexibility to deploy this capital. We will do that overtime, because the amount is very large. As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation plans when we review our March quarter results. And when you look at our track record of what we’ve done over the last several years, you’ve seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow. And so that is the approach that we’re going to be taking. We’re going to be very thoughtful and deliberate about it. Obviously, we want to make the right decisions in the best interest of our long-term shareholders.
Shannon Cross: And then, Tim, maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you’re hearing from customers in terms of the iPhone demand. How you’re thinking about the potential decay rate, for lack of a better term, with the high-end phones and over $1,000 phone versus balancing that with now your ability to ship phones down below $400, because you’ve expanded the product line so much when you launched your phones in 2017? Thank you.
TimCook: The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double-digits. And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that for an average weekly sales basis, it’s actually 22%. And so it was a stellar quarter for iPhone. The iPhone X was the most popular and that’s particularly noteworthy given that we didn’t start shipping until early November, and we’re constrained for a while. The team did a great job of getting into supply demand balance there in December. But since the launch of iPhone X, it has been the most popular iPhone every week, every week sales. And that is even through today, actually through January. And so we feel fantastic about the results. The most important thing for us is that really the number, it’s customer satisfaction. And customer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X. We think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X from -- we went from Touch ID to Face ID; Face ID has been incredibly well received; the wireless charging, the edge to edge super retina display; and totally new gestures, the user experience is different. And so it’s great to get that kind of feedback. If you look at the the overall iPhone line to get to the essence of the question, I think. I looked -- I reviewed the top many markets, I’ll talk briefly about the top four. In Urban China and the U.S., the top five smartphones last quarter were all iPhones. And in Japan and the UK, six of the top seven were iPhones. And so in a market that is as large as the smartphone market is, people want some level of choice and they’re deciding which ones to buy. But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.
Operator: Next, we’ll go Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Growing double-digits of such a large revenue base is impressive in itself. But if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue, as well as, I think on my math, iPhone shipments when you compare it to the December quarter. So just how should we read into a modest slowdown in average weekly growth as it relates to the last question around the decay of demand around the higher priced products? Or any impact that you might be seeing from the lower-priced battery replacements or anything else in the market? And then I have a follow-up.
Luca Maestri: We are guiding to $62 billion. It's a strong double-digit growth, 13% to 17%. In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. So when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in six months. This is at the macro level. We typically don't go into this level of detail, but think it's important this quarter to give you additional color. And maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year, during the March quarter. And also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and ASP that are embedded in our guidance. Historically, because the channel fill and the holiday season, our selling volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through. This year, the difference was further magnified, because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. We had a very successful product ramp. We were able to reach supply/demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1 and this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2. Now, for units, there is a second point to consider. We typically reduced channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2, because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. So we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well. For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you know, our newest products this year have a higher ASP than they had in the past. And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. So in summary, our guidance for iPhone; we got double digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. For the balance of the Company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double-digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like we’ve seen during the December quarter. I hope this helps.
Katy Huberty: Yes, that's great color. Just a follow-up on gross margin. Guidance for flat gross margin in March is pretty seasonal, but you do have the tailwind from currency. And so if you can just comment on how you think that flows into the model over the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar. And what your outlook might be around component costs in the near future. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Let me walk you through the sequential first. So we’re guiding about flat sequentially in spite of the loss of leverage. That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix. FX on a sequential basis is fairly muted, because as you know, we've got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in the short term. Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translating to gross margin tailwind quickly. And so I think we need to keep that in mind. We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. But it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.
Operator: Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray has our next question.
Mike Olson: I know you don't talk about future products, which is often presses to questions about future products and I'll give it a shot. When you think conceptually about the path for iPhone X Style devices going forward. Is there any reason the roadmap wouldn’t consists of multiple devices as we’ve seen with past iPhone upgrades? In other words, the 10 was unique amongst recent iPhone launches, because it's a singular device, potentially limiting the shots on go for upgrades given limited options. How do you think about that, going forward? And then I have a follow up.
TimCook: Mike, you did a good job of answering your question. I think at the beginning, we don’t really comment on future products. But I would tell you that we’re thrilled with the reception of iPhone X. And as we said when we launched it, we were setting up the next decade. And that is how we look at it. And so that's the reason it's chockfull of incredible innovation. And so you can bet that we're pulling that string.
Mike Olson: And then how you're think about AR beyond iPhone? You've created the world's largest AR platform. You've got developers generating a wide variety of apps. I realized it's still early days. But do you see Apple as a provider of a larger ecosystem of AR-enabled device beyond iPhone and iPad in the coming years? Or should investors focus on the opportunity within your existing device portfolio for at least the foreseeable future? Thanks.
TimCook: I see AR as being profound. I think, AR has the ability to amplify human performance instead of isolating humans. And so I am a huge, huge believer in AR. We put a lot of energy on AR removing very fast. We've gone from ARkit 1.0 to 1.5 in just a matter of months. I couldn't be happier with the rate and face of the developer community, how faster developing these things. And I don’t want to say what we may do. But I could not be happier with how things are going right now.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have a question and follow-up. You commented on how your install based over the last couple of years has grown 30%. And iPhone is clearly the largest component of that, and so iPhone install base is probably growing close to that number perhaps last, call it 20% through 25%. Yet, if we look at iPhone unit growth for fiscal ’18 what’s implied with your guidance fiscal ’17 and fiscal ’16, it’s been relatively flat. So you have an install base that’s 20% plus higher, and a unit growth that relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating. And I’m wondering whether you agree with that and whether investors should be worried about that. And maybe if I could just add one other wrinkle to potentially get your response on is. Given consumers’ heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as opposed to upgrades. Isn’t that also something that investors should potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact on upgrade rate going forward? And then believe or not, I have a follow-up.
TimCook: This is up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so I don’t want to put myself in the position of that. The way that I look at this and the numbers you’ve quoted have a different view of them. But generally what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic. The second or the previously owned market has expanded in units over the years. And you see in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in. And because iPhone has the largest residual rate on it, it acts as a buffer for the customer to buy new one and it lines up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It’s more people on iPhones the better. I would like to point out that the ever year major product hit a high on the active install base. And so that’s iPad, it’s Mac and those are huge numbers as well. And so as we’ve always said, there is a large part of the -- or the vast majority of the services are mapped to the install base instead of the quarterly sales. And this quarter is no different on that. On the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape, or form, what it would do to upgrade rates. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do for our customers. And sitting here today, I don't know what effect it will have. And again, it’s not -- was not in our thought process of deciding to do what we've done.
Toni Sacconaghi: And just a follow-up, maybe I could clarify two little things. One, Luca, on tax rate, you talked about 15% for Q2. Is that how we should think about the tax rate on an ongoing basis? And then just back to you on your response, Tim, I guess maybe you could just comment on whether you believe the upgrade rate has decreased over the last couple of years, because again, just mechanically install base is growing 20 and units are relatively flat over that period. Isn't that telling the install base is -- upgrade rate is going down, or am I not thinking about other considerations? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Toni, on the tax rate, I will make two comments. First of all, the new tax law in the United States is complex. And I think we, as many other companies, are really trying to absorb what this all means. And I think we're going to be receiving, over the next few months, implementation guidance. So we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter, and we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. So it may be a bit bumpy in the short-term as we understand the law in full, and it actually gets explained in full. But I would say that for the current fiscal year, the guidance that we provided for Q2 should be approximately what you should be seeing. As we get into new fiscal year, so many things change and we need to take that into account, the geographic mix of our products and so on. But I would say for the remainder of the year, it's what we’re guide to.
Tim Cook: I think on the replacement cycle, Toni, the answer is, probably looks different by geography. In those geographies that had, in the early days of the smartphone market, had very traditional subsidies where you paid $199 out the door or $99 or whatever. I think it's accurate to save those type of markets. The replacement cycle is likely longer. Where that isn't the case, I am not nearly as sure on that. I would point out that that happened some time ago and so it's very difficult currently to ever get a real time handle on replacement rate, because you obviously not -- you don't know the replacement rate for the products you're currently selling, you only know that in an historical sense. So it's not something that we are overly fixate on.
Operator: Next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham.
Laura Martin: I love the 1.3 billion devices you gave us, updating from two years ago. And I’d love the onramp as you spread out the pricing. Do you get a sense that we have more unique users in that 1.3 billion than we had unique users back there in 2016?
Tim Cook: Laura, I missed the first part of that, you broke up on the phone.
Laura Martin: So we have 1.3 billion [technical difficulty] unique users or I mean fewer products, so we have a higher percentage of unique [users] in the 1.3 devices and more in the billion devices. Is it a [technical difficulty] are they….
Tim Cook: Laura, you're cutting in and out. But I'm going to take a swing at what I think you're asking. I think you're asking, are there more active users today than there were two years ago when we had 1 billion active devices. And the answer is absolutely, there are many, many more.
Laura Martin: Yes, I was asking as a percent, the ownership. You see 1.4 billion devices owned per person. Do you think it's now 1.2 billion or 1.6 billion?
Tim Cook: Well, that 1.4 billion, I don't know where that came from. It did not come from Apple. And so that's one of the things that kind of flowed out there. And I want to divorce Apple from that number. We’re not releasing a user number, because we think that the proper way to look at it is to look at active devices. It's also the one that is the most accurate for us to measure. And so that's our thinking behind there.
Laura Martin: Switchers in the quarter, you often give us switchers.
Tim Cook: It is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only starting in November that we do not feel we have data at this point that would be very meaningful to share. And so I'll pump that question until next time around.
Operator: Next we'll go to Steve Milunovich from UBS.
Steve Milunovich: Tim, you said you don't want to tell investors what to do. But the first point you made was talking about the size of the install base. Later you've talked about the importance of customer satisfaction. Given that this doesn't look like a super-cycle in terms of unit growth, are you nudging us to focus on the size of the install base, the annuity opportunity here? And do you have confidence that you can monetize that install base through additional hardware and services?
Tim Cook: What I said on the investor part is that I think every investor has to look at their own situation and conclude the things that they think are important. What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important and that's the reason that we released the number two years ago, and the reason that we’re releasing that again today. That number speaks to the strength of the product the loyalty of the customer, the strength of the ecosystem. And so we do put a lot of weight behind that. And it obviously also fuels the services business. So I have long believed that on 90 day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time. And customer satisfaction and engagement and number of active devices are all part of that.
Steve Milunovich: And could you address the positioning of HomePod? What category is it in, is it a music speaker, is it a home system, since people seem to be trying to position it versus Amazon and Google’s offerings? And is the target market primarily Apple Music users?
Tim Cook: HomePod is an incredible product that is a unbelievable audio experience in a very small form factor with a super digital assistant in Siri that knows an enormous amount of music. But also can handle request to like home automation to close your garage door, open your door, turn the light on, turn the fireplace on, change the thermostat, all of the things that you would like to do in home automation. But takes it further, because we think do it right from the home app instead of seeing. So you can see, hey Siri, I’m reading and your room will change to the things you would like happening in that particular room for when you read, maybe it’s a particular light, maybe it’s a type of light, maybe it’s the fireplace, so on and so forth. It also, obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a speaker phone. And so if you’re talking to your parents or they’re talking to their grand kids, its unbelievable audio quality for speaker phone. You can also have Siri call for you, you can send messages, you can get a Uber car or a Lyft car. And so there is just a whole variety of things. And so I think the use cases on this much like our phones will be broad based. Some people will use it significantly for music and others may use it significantly for as a digital assistance; and I think the majority of people will likely use all of it and use all of the functionality of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: I have two questions as well. I guess first one. Could you just touch on what you’re seeing in China in terms of underlying trends, right now? I think growth was up double-digit year-over-year but essentially in line to what you saw in September. I would have thought that would have accelerated a little bit with iPhone X. Just the puts and takes in China will be great.
Tim Cook: It’s a good question. Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. And so even though we were reporting a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which probably is much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration. And specifically the numbers this quarter as reported are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year but on an average weekly revenue basis, we were up 19%. Also Mainland China, we had an all-time record for revenue in Mainland China. And of course a key part of that was iPhone. And as I’ve mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top five selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. And so we could not be more pleased with how we're doing. And if you look at the other -- we obviously grew share for iPhone in the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter and wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter. And so everywhere I look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China.
Amit Daryanani: Luca, maybe a question for you. When you talked about reducing Apple's net cash levels to zero effectively over time, I think that implies -- the number goes from $163 billion today to something like zero. What does over time mean for Apple? Is that one year, three years, 10 years, or how do you define over time? And does this change your thoughts around M&A at all, and is that one reason to get that number from $163 billion to zero. Does it change your M&A thought process?
Luca Maestri: Let me answer, Amit, starting with M&A. Our thought process around M&A has always been the same, and really doesn't change. We've been acquiring companies over the years. In calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies. And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product roadmaps, filling gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. So it's always with the customer experience in mind that we make acquisitions. We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform. And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report at the March quarter and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on. And so we’ll try to be to be very thoughtful. As we said, $163 billion is a large amount and there are even practical considerations around it. So we'll see.
Tim Cook: And just for clarity, let me add one thing. What Luca is saying is not cash equals zero. He's saying there's an equal amount cash and debt, and that they balance to zero. Just for clarity.

69;AAPL;2018-05-02;"Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thank you, Nancy, and to everyone joining us, welcome. We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings. We generated $61.1 billion of revenue. That's up 16% from last year, making it our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with iPhone revenue up 14%, services up 31% and wearables up almost 50%. We grew in each of our geographic segments, and in Greater China and Japan, revenue was up more than 20%. iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years. iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market. And customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, this is the first cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. Q2 was our best quarter ever for services and momentum there continues to be incredibly strong. Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more than $2 billion over last year's March quarter. We had all-time record revenue from the App Store, from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers. Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago and up $30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in services revenue. Apple Pay continues its strong growth with active users more than doubling and transactions tripling year-over-year. We believe the availability of Apple Pay at major transit systems have been a key driver of adoption among commuters and in March, we launched Express Transit with Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the second and third largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful mobile transit payment system in Tokyo, which has the busiest transit system of all. With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets and we expect Norway, Poland and Ukraine to launch in the next several months. This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats and AirPods with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year. Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company. Apple Watch had another great quarter with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record. Millions of customers are using Apple Watch to help them stay active, healthy and connected and they have made it the top selling watch in the world. We launched carrier support for Series 3 with cellular in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Thailand during the quarter with more markets on the way. And now with Watch OS 4.2, there are more features than ever before. For example, in addition to tracking your workouts and heart rate, skiers and snowboarders can record runs, see vertical descent and calculate speed, as well as contribute data directly to the Apple Watch activity app. AirPods are incredibly popular and we're seeing them in more and more places, in the gym, in coffee shops, wherever people are enjoying music on their Apple devices. This product is a runaway hit, and we're working hard to meet the incredible demand. We started shipping HomePod in February, and it's widely recognized as having the best audio quality for its size and class. HomePod is a breakthrough speaker that delivers amazing sound, and we believe it will change the way people listen to music at home. It's currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and we're looking forward to adding new features to HomePod and introducing it to more markets around the world soon. In March, we announced new products for the education community, including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil. It empowers students to be even more creative and productive, from learning to code to sketching ideas and jotting down handwritten notes to marking up screenshots. And the new iPad's gorgeous retina display, advanced chip and enhanced cameras and sensors are designed to support the next generation of apps for immersive augmented reality experiences in the classroom. In addition to our successful Everyone Can Code initiative, we've launched Everyone Can Create. It's a new free curriculum that makes it fun and easy for teachers to integrate drawing, music, film making or photography into their existing lesson plans for any subject. We believe education is the great equalizer. And whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology. In March, we also released iOS 11.3, a major update offering new immersive augmented reality experiences, access to personal health records in the Health app and more. Apps can now deliver AR experiences that use vertical walls and doors in addition to tables and chairs and can make – more accurately map irregular shaped surfaces. The update to ARKit that made this possible came just six months after we launched the world's largest AR platform. Also in iOS 11.3, patients in nearly 40 health systems representing hundreds of hospitals and clinics can now consolidate their medical records from multiple sources and view them all in one place, right from their iPhone. This data is encrypted and protected with the user's iPhone passcode, and it can help them better understand their health history, have informed conversations with doctors and family members, and make future health care decisions. Consistent with our long-term focus, privacy is a key element of these initiatives for education and personal health. We're relentless about making the best products and experiences in the world, while fiercely protecting our users' privacy, because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. Our environmental initiatives recently passed an important milestone. All of our global facilities across 43 countries are now powered with 100% clean energy. We work with communities around the world to build clean power sources. Apple now has 25 renewable energy projects operational and 15 more under construction. We're also driving our supply chain to use clean energy. As of last month, 23 of our suppliers are committed to operating on 100% renewable energy. We're now halfway through our fiscal 2018 with nearly $150 billion in revenue and double digit growth in all of our geographic segments. We generated almost $34 billion in earnings in six months, and we're very bullish on Apple's future. We have the best pipeline of products and services we've ever had. We have a huge installed base of active devices that is growing across all products, and we have the highest customer loyalty and satisfaction in the industry. Our services business is growing dramatically. Our balance sheet and our cash flow generation are strong and that allows us to invest significantly in our product roadmap and still return a very meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders. Recent corporate tax reform enables us to deploy our global cash more efficiently. In the United States, we expect our direct investment in the economy to exceed $350 billion over the next five years, including $30 billion in capital expenditures. And we expect to create over 20,000 U.S. jobs at Apple over that timeframe. We're narrowing the site selection for a new U.S. campus, and we look forward to sharing more information on that later this year. Consistent with our annual cadence, today we're providing an update on our capital return program. Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly from large pension funds to individuals with retirement accounts. So today, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, we're announcing a significant update to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization as well as a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective with our next dividend payable later this month. Luca will provide more details about our program as well as a more in-depth discussion of the quarter's results. So I'll now turn the call over to him. Luca?
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to report record financial results for our March quarter with revenue growth of 16%, EPS up 30%. Starting with revenue, we generated $61.1 billion, our highest ever for a March quarter. Revenue grew in all of our geographic segments, setting new Q2 records in most countries we track. Performance was very strong in emerging markets where revenue was up 20% and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in 10 quarters. We also set Q2 revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in Japan. Gross margin was 38.3%, essentially flat sequentially, as we offset the seasonal loss of leverage with cost improvements and a shift in mix toward services. Operating margin was 26% of revenue. Net income was $13.8 billion, up $2.8 billion over last year and a March quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to a new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong at $15.1 billion. iPhone revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with iPhone ASP increasing to $728 from $655 a year ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. During the quarter we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Vietnam. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year. We exited the March quarter within our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Our customers are extremely happy with their iPhones. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, the customer satisfaction rating was 95%, and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, customer satisfaction was even higher, at 99%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services. We had a sensational quarter with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion, and that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31% and double the services revenue we generated in the March quarter just four years ago. Our services business is growing at a very fast pace all around the world, with revenue up more than 25% year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments. The App Store set a new all-time revenue record in the March quarter and Apple Music reached a new record for both revenue and paid subscribers, which have now passed 40 million. iCloud storage revenue was up by over 50% year-over-year to a new all-time record, and AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in five quarters, setting a new March quarter record. Our other product category also set a new record for the March quarter with revenue of almost $4 billion. We began shipping HomePod in February and unit sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high for the March quarter. When we combine all our wearables and home products, they accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac which set a new March quarter revenue record including new records in both the Americas and Greater China. We sold 4.1 million Macs, generating year-over-year growth in many emerging markets including Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and India. We were happy to see double digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac. iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. We sold 9.1 million iPads and about half of purchases were by customers new to iPad. Growth was particularly strong in Japan, in Latin America, Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. All markets where iPad sales were up double digits compared to a year ago. We gained share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC and our active installed base of iPads reached an all-time high. NPD indicates that iPad has 53% of the U.S. tablet market in the March quarter, up from 40% share a year ago. And the most recent customer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 95% and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the June quarter, 73% plan to purchase iPads. We continue to make great strides in the enterprise market. In February, we announced a new cyber risk management solution for businesses with Cisco, Aon and Allianz. This combined approach is an industry first that integrates the most secure technology from Apple and Cisco, cyber resilience evaluation services from Aon and options for enhanced cyber insurance coverage from Allianz. Organizations will now be able to better manage and protect themselves from cyber risks associated with ransomware and other malware-related threats. We are thrilled that insurance industry leaders recognize that Apple products provide superior security. In March, we announced two new services with IBM to bring more dynamic and intelligent insights into apps. IBM Watson services for Core ML and IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple will enable developers to more easily build native iOS apps that bring together machine learning with artificial intelligence and cloud services. In healthcare, iPhones are being used across leading health systems including Cedars-Sinai, the Mayo Clinic and HCA Healthcare with iOS apps to support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery. In fact, HCA Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,000 iPhones across their hospital sites within the next three years. We had great performance from our retail and online stores which produced their highest March quarter revenue ever. Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone as well as strong performance from AirPods and introduction of HomePod. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very popular Today at Apple sessions with a particular emphasis on coding and app design. During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $267.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, and we had $110 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $145 billion. We returned nearly $27 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $23.5 billion on repurchases of 137 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also retired 5.7 million shares upon the completion of our 13 ASR during the quarter. We have now completed over $275 billion of our current $300 billion capital return program, including $200 billion in share repurchases against our cumulative $210 million buyback program. We will complete the $210 billion program during the June quarter, three full quarters sooner than initially planned. The biggest priorities for our cash have not changed over the years. We want to maintain the cash we need to fund our day-to-day operations, to invest in our future, and to provide flexibility so that we can respond effectively to the strategic opportunities we encounter along the way. As we said 90 days ago, the new tax legislation enacted in December gives us increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash. It allows us to invest for growth in the United States more efficiently and it also provides us the opportunity to work towards a more optimal capital structure. As we said in February, our goal is to become approximately net cash neutral over time. Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program which we will start executing during the June quarter. Considering the unprecedented size of this new authorization, we want to be particularly thoughtful and flexible in our approach to repurchasing shares. Our intention is to execute our program efficiently and at a fast pace. As in the past, we will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of every quarter. We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than six years. As we know, it is very important for our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, an increase of 16%. This is effective with our next dividend which the board has declared today, payable on May 17, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2018. With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be among the largest dividend payers in the world and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. We will continue to review our capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, our investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix and the pace of our program. We expect to provide a new update to our capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million. And we expect our tax rate to be about 14.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please?
Operator: Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of iPhone and positioning now that we're a couple of quarters out from the launch of the iPhone X. Given the $1,000 price point, and it's clearly selling but there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of holistically across your lineup. So if you could talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers and then I have a follow up. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Sure. Shannon, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone and that's a combination of single digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X. I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as a smartphone market and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs. On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so with the customer set that Luca referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product. And so I think that it's one of those things where like a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points but it's a Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it. I could not be prouder of the product.
Shannon S. Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about working capital, specifically inventory which went up pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter? What's driving that and how are you thinking about, I mean, it's one of the uses of cash obviously, so how are you thinking about inventory and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward?
Luca Maestri: Yeah, Shannon, you know that we've always generated significant amount of cash through working capital. We've got a negative cash conversion cycle and we plan to continue to have that. Our inventory level has gone up. It's just a temporary event. We have decided to make some purchasing decision, given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time.
Shannon S. Cross: So that was essentially component purchases?
Luca Maestri: Correct.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Shannon.
Shannon S. Cross: Okay. Thank you very much.
Nancy Paxton: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Morgan Stanley, Katy Huberty.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. The services growth acceleration is really the highlight this quarter in my mind. Can you talk about what the biggest drivers, whether it be products or regions that drove the acceleration and do you think that we can continue to see growth north of 30%? And then I have a follow-up.
Timothy Donald Cook: Hi, Katy. It's Tim. The services grew 31%. We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion. The great news about it is, it's not a single geo or a single service. If you look at it, each of the geos, the minimum was at 25%. So each of the geos did extremely well and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and more. And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions had moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter. And so it's very broad-based in terms of type of service and geographic region. It's sort of exactly what we would like to see. In terms of forecasting moving forward, we've obviously made assumption for our guidance that Luca provided earlier and in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 goal of doubling the services revenue of 2016 as we had talked about previously.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: And it doesn't look like the threat of a trade war with China slowed down that business. In fact, growth accelerated. But anything anecdotally that you see in the business in recent weeks that would suggest that that is having an impact on demand and any actions that Apple is taking as a company to preempt any risk of tariffs going forward?
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah, I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic. I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed. And so I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that – I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: And that will come from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Michael J. Olson: Hey. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Just following on the services question, I'd be curious what the next drivers of services revenue are. Will it be continued penetration of Music and Pay that you see as kind of the largest future categories of incremental growth? Or maybe when could augmented reality become a material part of services? And then I have a follow up.
Timothy Donald Cook: Well, Mike, it's Tim. Again, the great thing about services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely. And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is at such a level, that last quarter we said that we had exceeded 1.3 billion. This year – we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double digit number on a year-over-year basis. And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.
Michael J. Olson: Okay. And then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically, or something else that's behind that improvement? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: It's a good question. iPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our wearables business in China and the services business, which you and I just spoke about. The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number. And we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. We also – more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top three selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was number one, but we had several in the top.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: From RBC Capital Markets, Amit Daryanani.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Two questions from me as well. I guess first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics, if I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on a gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?
Luca Maestri: Yeah, Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business. But in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment, particularly we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And if I could just follow up. Tim, you've been fairly vocal I think talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand, how does Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time?
Timothy Donald Cook: We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control of it. We also collect much less overall than others do. Because if you look at our model, if we can convince you to buy an iPhone or an iPad, we'll make a little bit of money. You're not our product. And so that's how we look at that. In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like that. We view that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. And we've always viewed that part of our role was to sort of make things as simple as possible for the user and provide them a level of privacy and security. And so that's how we look at it.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Great. Thank you. Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done, so are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here? And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you give us any timeframe of that $100 billion and how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash zero?
Luca Maestri: Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it by 16%. This is the largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back in August of 2012. So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities which we do in an ongoing basis. But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons we see a lot of value in the stock. We believe the stock is undervalued and so we have a bias towards the buyback. So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends but we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily. We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large and so we will try to execute it. As you've seen from our track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace but we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion of repurchases during the March quarter. We will give you an update to our activities at the end of every quarter and then 12 months from now we will actually talk about an update to the entire program. So you will be able to keep track of our progress every 90 days.
Steven Milunovich: Thank you. And, Tim, could you talk a bit about your healthcare opportunity? Is it merely selling watches over time or do you think more broadly about it? Is there a services play? You're doing some things for your employees. Could that potentially broaden out? How do you think about the opportunity there?
Timothy Donald Cook: We think about it very broadly and you can tell that a bit by some of the things that we've had going with ResearchKit and CareKit and most recently the health records that I had referenced in my initial comments and those all came out of getting significantly engaged in the Apple Watch and sort of pulling the strings, so to speak. And we also have a heart study that is going on currently, and so I don't want to give too much away. But it's an area of great interest where we think we can make a big difference in. And so it's a major strategic thrust of ours.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: We'll go to Brian White with Monness, Crespi.
Brian J. White: Yes, Tim, I think there is China numbers are actually phenomenal in the quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth. I think there's been a lot of concerns just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. But what do you see as the drivers for Apple in both Mainland China and Greater China over the next few years? And also if you could just give us an update on what you're seeing in India.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah, good question. Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about China. India, we set a new first-half record. So we continue to put great energy there and try to – our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working toward those things. It's a huge market and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time, as we've seen in other countries. China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view, but also lots of opportunity from a app developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. So we look at China holistically, not only as a market. On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top selling smartphone during the quarter. We gained share during the quarter. I read some notes here and there about the market itself not being good. I think on any kind of, on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen. But my own personal view of China is that it's a great market, and we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the opportunity and the environment there. I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services is doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts and I'm very pleased with the results that we were able to show during the quarter.
Brian J. White: Great. Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Next we'll hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim, can you comment on the price elasticity of demand at the high end for iPhones, if that was in line with your expectations? Do you have a preference for unit growth versus ASP growth when it comes to maximizing that gross profit dollar growth? And I have a follow-up for Luca, please.
Timothy Donald Cook: We price for the value that we're delivering, and iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market. And I've said a few times, we have there sort of jam-packed with technologies that really set up the smartphone for the next decade. And so that's how we priced it. We were surprised somewhat that through all of this period of time that the iPhone X winds up at the most selling, most popular for every week of the time since the launch. And so that's I think a powerful point. And it's number one in China, which is another powerful point. And so obviously at some point if those technologies move to lower price points and that there's probably more unit demand. But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver and I feel that we did that.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you, Tim. And, Luca, your gross margins have been very robust despite the headwinds that you absorbed on commodities, which you quantified, and frankly, also from the FX hedges that are limiting somewhat the FX upside that a lot of other companies are seeing. So as you, one, when do you expect these to turn into tailwinds? And when they do turn into tailwinds, would you consider reinvesting some of those into pricing or should we think about you flowing those through to the bottom line?
Luca Maestri: Well, Wamsi, I think, let me start with where we are right now. I think you're right. I think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange environment for a number of years and now, as you know, because we have this hedging program as the dollar has weakened a bit in recent months, although during the last week it's actually started to turn the other way again, we've got the hedging program that works both ways. And also on the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. And so that should provide some level of stability. As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment and so hopefully that can turn into a positive for us. At the same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going to happen in the future because every product cycle is different, and as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle. For example, our cost structures that we are able to manage throughout the year. But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. And the mix of products and services that we sell to our customers also has an impact on the overall gross margin. Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around for example pricing decisions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: From Citi, we'll hear from Jim Suva.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. And I'll ask actually both my questions at the same time, one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, strategically when we talk to investors they often say, oh, iPhone market is saturated. There's not much room for growth. Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like India and all those still are growth. When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher or a more normalized market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing? And then, Luca, on the question for you, is about the gross margin. When we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start to look for some potential margin, gross margin upside, again should components stabilize? Thank you, gentlemen.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah, Jim, thanks for the question. In terms of the – let me address the smartphone market a bit and then I'll mention iPhone. In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which is the last data point we have on the full market, there were still 0.5 billion feature phones sold in the world. And so many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them, but many of them. And we still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smartphone. And so it seems to us that with that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity. In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the – our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. And so our task is to convince people that currently – or have another type of phone to switch, while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose – when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone. And so we've spent quite a bit of time on that, as you might guess. I do think that India, India is the third largest smartphone market in the world. There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely low share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of energy there and working with the carriers in that market, and they're investing enormously on the LTE networks. And the infrastructure has come quite a ways since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth. And so I do think – I don't buy the view that market's saturated. I don't see that from a market point of view or – and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world and – but that's how I feel about it. It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.
Luca Maestri: Jim, on the gross margin side, I think I'll repeat what I said earlier, but you're right. Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins. And so as we are able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling. At a macro level, because about two-thirds of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins; a strong dollar, as it's been during the last four years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging program. And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces. And so that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. So we need to balance all these different elements. I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at managing all these different variables and coming out with a level of gross margins that we think is really good for investors and certainly it is our plan to continue to manage them that way. But it's very difficult for me to give you a prediction of where gross margins are going to be six months or 12 months from now.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim.
Jim Suva: Thank you for the details and congratulations.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thank you.

70;AAPL;2018-08-01;"Operator: Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I'd like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently-filed periodic reports on form 10-K and form 10-Q and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective date. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thank you, Nancy, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone, services and wearables. We generated $53.3 billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last year's result, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and our strongest rate of growth in the past 11 quarters. Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34, an increase of 40% over last year. We're extremely proud of these results and I'd like to share some highlights with you. First, iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year-over-year and our active installed base grew by double-digits, driven by switchers, first time smartphone buyers and our existing customers whose loyalty we greatly appreciate. iPhone X was the most popular iPhone in the quarter once again, with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market, gaining share in many markets including the U.S., Greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East and Africa. Second, we had a stellar quarter in services which generated all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our services business and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. Our record services results were driven by strong performance in a number of areas and I'd like to briefly mention just some of these. Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed $300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone. Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business. What's more, the number of apps offering subscriptions also continue to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the App Store today. The App Store turned 10 years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record. The App Store has exceeded our wildest expectations, igniting a cultural and economic phenomenon that has changed how people work, learn and play. Customers around the world are visiting the App Store more often and downloading more apps than ever before. And based on third party research estimates, the App Store generated nearly twice the revenue of Google Play so far in 2018. The app economy is thriving and thanks to the App Store, it's generating jobs for tens of millions of people around the world. Our developers have earned over $100 billion from the App Store since its launch and we couldn't be more proud of them and what they've accomplished. We're hearing lots of developer excitement around our upcoming OS releases, which I'll talk about more in a moment, and can't wait to see what they can come up with next. We've experienced rapid growth in our App Store search ad service and as we announced earlier this month, we are expanding our geographic coverage to Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We're also seeing strong growth in many of the other services as well. Just a few examples, Apple Music grew by over 50% on a year-over-year basis. AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in 18 quarters, partly due to our expanded distribution initiative. Cloud services revenue was also up over 50% year-over-year. Our communications services are experiencing record usage. We've hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of Messages and the number of FaceTime calls made with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters. Siri requests have already exceeded 100 billion so far this fiscal year, and the number of articles read on Apple News more than doubled year-over-year. Apple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago, with growth accelerating from the March quarter. To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter, we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal. Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year. We're excited to share that in the U.S., eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7-Eleven will roll out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall. Transit is another important area of growth and Apple Pay can be used with iPhone and Apple Watch to quickly and conveniently ride public transit in 12 metropolitan areas. Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the U.S. less than eight months following its launch. Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in wearables which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats and was up over 60% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the March quarter. Our wearables revenue exceeded $10 billion over the last four quarters, a truly remarkable accomplishment for a set of products that has only been in the market for a few years. Apple Watch delivered record June quarter performance with growth in the mid 40% range, and we're thrilled to see so many customers enjoying AirPods. It reminds me of the early days of iPod when I started noticing white earbuds everywhere I went. A number of other notable events in the quarter, we expanded distribution of HomePod to three additional markets and we added new immersive listening features with support for HomePod stereo pairs and a new multi-room audio system. In June, we hosted an extremely successful developers' conference that previewed many major advances coming this fall to our four operating systems, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Developer and customer reaction has been very positive and we have over 4 million users participating in our new OS beta programs. Starting with iOS 12, Siri will take a major step forward with Siri Shortcuts, which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app to work with Siri. We believe this will make Siri even more useful and significantly expand its adoption. We've also designed performance improvements across iOS 12 to make everyday tasks faster and more responsive. Camera launches up to 70% faster. The keyboard appears up to 50% faster and apps can launch up to twice as fast. We've always been about empowering users to get the most from our product, but not about spending all of their time using them and so we're adding tools to iOS 12 to help our customers understand and take control of the time both they and their families spend interacting with their iOS devices. Activity reports will provide information on the amount and nature of time spent on iPhones and iPads and screen time will enable parents to monitor and limit their children's activity from their own iOS devices using Family Sharing in iCloud. Developers will be able to build even more intelligent apps with just a few lines of code using the power of machine learning with Core ML 2 and Create ML. We've also included our third release of ARKit in only one year. With ARKit 2, iOS 12 will provide an even more powerful platform to make dynamic AR apps, integrating shared and persistent AR experiences, object detection and image tracking. We believe AR can enable profound experiences and Apple is uniquely positioned to provide the best AR experience because of the seamless integration of our hardware and software. The new capabilities of ARKit 2 will build on the potential of the thousands of AR apps already available in the App Store that are changing the way iPhone and iPad users see and experience the world. Turning to Mac, we want to empower our developers to bring their innovative apps from the iOS ecosystem to the Mac with minimal effort. Though iOS and macOS are different, they've shared common foundations from the very beginning, so we've taken key frameworks from iOS and adapted them to specific Mac behaviors like using a mouse or track pad, resizing windows, copy and paste and drag and drop. We've started with some of our own apps, so this fall, News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home will be available on the Mac for the first time with macOS Mojave and we'll be bringing these great new tools to our developers next year. We believe this will dramatically broaden the ecosystem to benefit all Mac users, creating even more great reasons to choose Mac. Also this fall, the Mac App Store is getting a full redesign with rich editorial content to help customers discover great Mac apps from our developers. We believe privacy is one of the most important issues of the 21st century and we're always working to make our products more private and more secure for our users. As we announced at WWDC, beginning this fall, Safari will prevent share buttons and comment widgets on webpages from tracking users without their permission. Safari already protects personal data as users browse the web so they won't be re-targeted by ads. For Apple Watch, users will see a significant expansion of features and functionality in watchOS 5. Apple Watch will become an even stronger companion for fitness, communication and quick access to information with features including new workouts, activity sharing competitions, auto workout detection, advanced running features, walkie-talkie, podcast and third party apps on the Siri watch face. For Apple TV, we've seen major growth in sales since the introduction of Apple TV 4K last fall as video providers around the world choose Apple TV 4K to deliver their subscription services. Later this year, Charter Communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 million U.S. households, providing access to live channels and tens of thousands of on-demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 4K, iPhone and iPad. And tvOS will take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find popular shows and movies. Apple TV 4K already offers customers the largest collection of 4K HDR movies and this fall, iTunes will be the home to the largest collection of Dolby Atmos-supported movies anywhere. I'm proud that our team's hard work has an impact even beyond these innovative industry-leading products and services. We're always working to leave the world better than we found it and as part of our commitment to address climate change and increase the use of renewable energy in our supply chain, we recently announced a first of its kind investment fund in China. Initially, 10 suppliers will join us in investing nearly $300 million over the next four years into the China Clean Energy Fund. The fund will invest in and develop clean energy projects totaling more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in China, the equivalent of powering nearly 1 million homes. We're seeing great momentum in our Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create initiatives. More than 5,000 schools and community colleges are now teaching Everyone Can Code and more than 350 schools have committed to incorporating Everyone Can Create into their curricula for the upcoming school year. Coding skills are opening doors for students and job seekers around the world as tremendous growth in the app economy creates opportunity everywhere we look. We're also teaming up with leading educators for blind and deaf communities across the United States who will start teaching Everyone Can Code this Fall. Looking ahead, we couldn't be more excited about the products and services in our pipeline as well as limitless applications for augmented reality and machine learning technology. We're working with key partners in the enterprise to change the way work gets done with iOS and Mac. We're welcoming communities and offering learning opportunities at our retail locations through hundreds of thousands of Today at Apple sessions each quarter. We're expanding our reach into emerging markets and seeing strong double-digit growth in revenue and we're making great progress toward our goal of significantly expanding our services business. And now, for more details on the record June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to report the financial results of our best June quarter ever. As we have done in every quarter this fiscal year, we set new quarterly records for both revenue and earnings per share, with revenue up 17% year-over-year and EPS up 40%. We generated $53.3 billion of revenue with year-over-year growth in all of our geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We grew in each of our top 15 markets, with especially strong performance in the U.S., Hong Kong, Russia, Mexico, the Middle East and Africa, all places where revenue was up by more than 20%. Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, as cost improvements and foreign exchange offset the seasonal loss of leverage. Net income was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion or 32% over last year and it was also a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.34, up 40% and also a new record for the June quarter and cash flow from operations was very strong at $14.5 billion. iPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago, driven by the strong performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world. During the quarter, we sold 41.3 million iPhones, with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.5 million units during the quarter. We exited the June quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, customer satisfaction was 96% and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, it was even higher at 98%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones, up 3 points from the last survey. Turning to services, we had our best results ever with all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion. Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. Excluding this amount, services revenue was still an all-time record and the underlying growth rate of our services business was a terrific 28% over last year. We generated double-digit services growth in all our geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services and Apple Pay all set new June quarter records. Our other product category also set a new record for the June quarter with revenue of over $3.7 billion. That's up 37% from last year with great sales momentum for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch continues to be the best selling smartwatch by a wide margin and units and revenue grew dramatically during the quarter. AirPods continue to be a runaway success and we've been selling them as fast as we can make them since their launch a year and a half ago. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We were very happy to see double digit year-over-year growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high with nearly 60% of purchases during the quarter coming from customers who are new to Mac. Our year-over-year sales performance was impacted by the different timing of the MacBook Pro launch which did not occur until early Q4 this year as opposed to June last year, with the subsequent channel fill during the June quarter. Even with a difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets, with growth well into double digits and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe. iPad unit sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter and we gained significant share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC. We recorded double digit iPad unit growth in both our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments with a new June quarter record for iPad sales in Mainland China. Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by customers new to iPad and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high. Our overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year which resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs and channel sale a year ago. NPD indicates that iPad has 60% share of the U.S. tablet market in the June quarter, up from 51% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 94%, and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads. We continue to make great strides with enterprise customers across multiple industries. For example, financial services institutions are increasingly using iPads to deploy digital signature solutions for customer consent, compliance requirements, new account openings and services transactions. In the railway industry, businesses around the world are using iPhone and iPad to support operations, training, passenger engagement and maintenance activities. And leading global automotive companies are deploying iPads in dealerships for sales enablement and end-to-end customer service management and are choosing iPhone as the standard mobile device for their employees around the world. More and more companies are giving their teams a choice when it comes to the devices they use at work and enterprises including Salesforce and Capital One are deploying Macs based on employee preference. In fact, at Salesforce, the majority of their 35,000 employees are using Macs and companies tell us that Mac has been instrumental in helping them attract and retain talent while providing strong security, streamlined deployment, workflow and significantly lower total cost of ownership. We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for organizations to connect with customers. Business Chat lets customers get answers to questions, resolve issues and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or iPad and even continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch. DISH Network is making Business Chat available to customers across the U.S. to enhance the customer service experience for pay TV. Customers can instantly reach a live agent with their questions, make account changes, schedule an appointment, or order a pay-per-view movie or sporting event, all without leaving the Messages conversation. And Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies, is testing Business Chat with Aramark to handle beverage holders during games. Fans simply use their iPhone camera to scan a QR code on the back of their seats taking them directly to a Business Chat conversation in Messages. From there, they can order drinks, pay quickly and securely with Apple Pay and have them delivered directly to their seats without missing a moment of on-field play. Our retail and online stores had a great quarter thanks to very strong growth from iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch and the expansion of HomePod to Canada, France and Germany. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very successful Today at Apple sessions. We continue to add content across all Today at Apple topics including popular new sessions on music and photography. We opened our 50th retail store in Greater China during the quarter and we just opened a beautiful new store in Milan this month, bringing the number of stores located outside the U.S. to 46% of the total. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $243.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $6 billion of debt during the quarter, leaving us with $102.6 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $129.1 billion. As we explained in February, we plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. We returned almost $25 billion to investors during the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents. We repurchased $20 billion worth of Apple shares of which $10 billion related to the completion of our previous $210 billion buyback program and $10 billion to the beginning of the new $100 billion authorization we announced three months ago for a total of 112.8 million shares repurchased through open market transactions during the quarter. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion. As you will recall, our September quarter results last year included a one-time favorable adjustment of $640 million to our services revenue. Taking that adjustment into account, our revenue guidance implies year-over-year growth of about 16% to 19%. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.95 billion and $8.05 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 15% before discrete items. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on August 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of August 13, 2018. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'll ask both my questions up front. First, for Tim. You're on track to hit your services revenue target even earlier than planned, so how are you thinking about the next legs of services growth as you move into the next three to five years? And then for you, Luca, NAND prices are falling this year. Services mix is rising. Those should both positively influence gross margins and yet we're seeing gross margin sort of hang out here at 38%. What are the offsetting headwinds and is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross margins drift higher? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah, Katy, thanks for your question. This is Tim. On the services side, we're thrilled with the results. They were very broad based. We had double digit services growth in all of the geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed the 300 million, as I'd mentioned before, and so we couldn't be happier with how things are going. In terms of the next leg of this, given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services, but obviously we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well. And so with the combination of these, we feel great about hitting our objectives and maybe even doing a little better.
Luca Maestri: Katy, for margins, let me tell you about the puts and takes for the June quarter, then I'll talk about the guidance for Q4 and make some general observations for the future. Starting with the June quarter, typically we see a decline in gross margin going from the March quarter to the June quarter. Last year, we were down 40 bps. Two years ago we were down 140 bps. This year, we were able to keep GM flat sequentially. During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. This year we were able to offset that with some cost improvements and also we had some favorability in foreign exchange on a sequential basis. Unfortunately, as you know, the U.S. dollar has already appreciated again recently, so we do not expect to see that favorability to repeat during the September quarter. So those are the puts and takes for June and we're very happy to see gross margin sequentially flat for June. For September, we're also guiding about flat sequentially at the midpoint. As you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the September quarter, and this year we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange again because the dollar has appreciated recently. We expect those two factors to be offset by positive leverage, because you've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to services that you've actually mentioned during your question. So we feel pretty good about also the guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but I think we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins. As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last three-plus years, but we've been able to manage that. On the memory front, it is true that prices have started to decline. It has been a significant headwind for the last 12, 18 months and still in the June quarter was a negative. We believe that we're going to start seeing some improvement from here on.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you for that color.
Nancy Paxton: Can we have the next question please? Can we have the next question please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about trends within your iPhone sales? ASPs were above expectations and now that you've had – and that's clearly better than some of the comments from some of your competitors. Now that you've had about nine months of experience with a high-end fully featured phone, can you talk a bit about what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is and how you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? And then I have a follow-up.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP growth of double digit. And so if you, and look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market. We priced it at a level that represented the value of it and we could not be happier that it has been the top selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel terrific about iPhone X. If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results. At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and Japan. And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.
Shannon S. Cross: Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about China, Greater China up 19% year-over-year during the quarter, I believe? Obviously iPhone doing well, but some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade world might have impacted. Doesn't seem like that, so I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah, it's a good question. Thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double digit growth in Greater China. I mentioned how iPhone X and the iPhones are selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there. In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure some people have questions on this. And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period – I think there's one that's exiting today – there have been three of those and maybe I can walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody is on the same page. The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum. That was many, many different countries. That started I believe at the beginning of June. There have been two other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or exiting the comment period in this month. I think the latest one is today. If you look at those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs. There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. That one is out for public comment. Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends. It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing and so we're going through that now and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back public comment. Of course the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And so that, and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it. All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well. That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: And that'll come from Brian White with Monness, Crespi. And Brian your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brian White: Yes, Tim. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey and what that says about your original content strategy and also Apple Music. If you can give us a little more colors or an update maybe around paid subscribers or total subscribers around Apple Music and how you feel that's rolled out.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. We're very excited to work with Oprah. We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world, that there's sort of no match and we think that we can do some great original content together and so we could not be happier in working with Oprah. As you know, we hired two highly respected television executives last year and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share all the details of it yet, but I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there and we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about what we will eventually offer. In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes, the cord cutting in our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV, units and revenue grew by very strong double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. There are, within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third party video subscriptions and we see the growth that is going on there. It's like 100% year-over-year. And so all the things from a – all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry, and so we're really happy to be working on some of them, but we're just not ready to talk about it in depth today. In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial, and so we're moving along at a very, very good rate. It appears to us or in what we've been told is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter and we have the leadership position in Japan, and so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time. We're doing quite well, but really, the key thing in music is not the competition between companies that are providing music. It's the real challenge is to grow the market, because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's, outside of China, it's less than 200 million probably around the world. And so it does seem to me there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well and I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that will be a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. But I like where we are. Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong results. Thanks for the question.
Brian White: Great. Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein has our next question.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I'm wondering as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. Perhaps you can help us think through how we should be thinking about Q4. I know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about Q3 ASPs.
Luca Maestri: Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for either units or ASPs for any product category, but of course we provided guidance on revenue and that the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. We expect the growth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from services and from wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year. On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I would point out is that obviously we're exiting the June quarter at a significantly higher level than in the past and so that I think is important to keep in mind as we move into the September quarter. It's important to keep in mind the type of revenue growth that we've implied in our guidance.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you. Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the health of the smartphone market. Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for four years and I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period which would suggest at least at the high end of the market, that it's perhaps flat-to-down and I'm wondering if you can comment on, A, whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles. And specifically, also what impact if any you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iPhones.
Timothy Donald Cook: I think the smartphone market is very healthy. I think it's actually the best market in the world to be in for someone that is in the business that we're in. It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. And so that's kind of the way that I view that. iPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. We're really pleased with that and if you look at the sort of the cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid single digits and on an average weekly sales point of view, and of course double digit on the ASP and so I think it's really healthy. In terms of replacement cycles, as I'd mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time and so I think that some are lengthening. And, but I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product, and I think that iPhone X shows that when you deliver a great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that and it can be a really good business, and so that's how to look at that. In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter and so we're thrilled with that and you can see that carrying through to the services line and the growth that we had there. In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how many people decided to get a lower-priced battery than buy another phone because it was never about that for us. It was always about doing something great for the user and I think if you treat the users and the customers well, then you have a good business over time and so that's how we'd look at that.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni.
Antonio M. Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Next we'll take a question from Laura Martin from Needham.
Laura Martin: Yeah, can you hear me okay?
Nancy Paxton: Yes.
Luca Maestri: Yes.
Laura Martin: Great. Okay. Super. So I'd like to focus on product roadmap and strategy. There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the Internet of Things. And with two products, the HomePod and Apple TV in the home, my question is strategically, how do you feel about the importance of being in the home and whether it threatens your dominance outside the home with your core business in the mobile devices if you sort of lose that battle? I'm just trying to figure out strategically when you think about where the puck is going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the home as well as out of home?
Timothy Donald Cook: I think the home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. They're both important products clearly, but everybody has their iPhone at home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their iPad at home. And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions. I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important. Home is important. Work is important. The movement between the two are important. Health is important. So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it and so I think all of those are important and we're focused on all of them.
Laura Martin: Okay. That's helpful, actually. Okay.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thanks for your question.
Laura Martin: Yeah. Sort of. I mean I'll watch your product roadmap and be able to tell what the answer is. The other thing, the thing I get in fights with investors about the most is this and I'd love your insight on this. I love the expansion of the new products. The question I have is are they actually on-ramps into the Apple ecosystem, the Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, subscriptions, are they on-ramps into the ecosystem or is the on-ramp to the ecosystem the iPhone and then these new products add revenue per member once you get somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone?
Timothy Donald Cook: A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, even though they might not currently use all the different products. And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. And there's the AirPods have really gone through the roof and the Apple Watch has hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole different level as I'd mentioned earlier with our overall wearables revenue. And so in my view, this is a part of the – they are a core part of the ecosystem.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Laura.
Laura Martin: But do they attract people to the ecosystem or does the person have to have an iPhone first?
Timothy Donald Cook: It is, well, but on your point though, it is clear from communications I've had with users that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple Watch.
Laura Martin: Oh, I see.
Timothy Donald Cook: So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the watch does so well and so it's not always a linear path. I see these things as being somewhat fluid and different for each user.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Laura.
Laura Martin: So they're complementary and self-reinforcing? Okay. That makes sense. All right. Thanks very much.
Timothy Donald Cook: That's exactly right. Thank you for the question.
Laura Martin: Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Laura.

71;AAPL;2018-11-02;"Operator: Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consistent of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch event of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store, and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year 2018, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year, and we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in three years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, services, and wearables drove our momentum and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments. It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X, and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second. The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition, using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photos, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field and Face ID is even faster. The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, iPhone XS and XS Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship, as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience. We're not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts, and new tools to help people reduce interruptions and manage screen time for themselves and their kids. Siri Shortcuts in particular is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat. iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider. More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivalled in its versatility and performance. When paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size Smart Keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the highly anticipated Group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices. For services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable one-time accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our services growth was 27%. We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem. I want to spotlight the exceptional performance at Apple Pay, which is by far the number one mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year. And to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal Mobile with over 4 times the growth rate. As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay. We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports, based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy. We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like Dark Mode, Stacks and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Consider alongside the release of iOS 12, WatchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects at Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5 times faster performance than before. With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor. Later this year, the ECG App will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram any time, right from their wrist. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, WatchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life-changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space and we look forward to making more in the future. We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room of your home. Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn, and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators, and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp. The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China, and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside the United States. Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. First education, more than 5,000 schools, community colleges, and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity, and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by zip code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring, designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad. Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable, and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple. This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems, and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers, and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future. And now, Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track, with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and wearables and new all-time records for services and Mac. Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, in line with our expectations, as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS, and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago. iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the successful launch of iPhone XS and XS Max in the September quarter this year, while we launched iPhone X in the December quarter last year. We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter, with growth of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Chile, and Vietnam. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services, it was our best quarter ever in total and virtually in every market around the world, with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we had a one-time $640 million favorable impact to services revenue due to an accounting adjustment. And taking that into account, our services growth in Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue records for many services categories, and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased not only with the growth but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available on the App Store today, and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July, with strong double-digit revenue growth driving an all time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging markets, with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all-time high, and the majority of customers purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac. We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track, based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, India, and South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad, and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high. NPD indicates that iPad had 58% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads. Other products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year. As we look back across fiscal 2018, we've made great progress in the enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly saver, more efficient flights and many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and improve maintenance operations. We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and employee experiences. We're seeing industry-wide adoption of iOS at thousands of retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences. Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year we introduced two new technology offerings. IBM Watson services for Core ML, and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries have been added since launching these new tools. In our new partnership with Salesforce, we're excited to bring together the number one customer relationship management platform and iOS. Together with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace a native mobile platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The companies will also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with a new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS. And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies around the world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies currently enrolled. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 billion to investors during quarter. We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segment grew double digits with new records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also set new all-time records for net income, up 23% versus last year, and EPS up 29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases. Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given the increasing importance of our services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter. Second, also beginning in this December quarter, we're adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classification of revenue between products and services. In particular, the revenue corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as Maps, Siri, and free iCloud services was previously reported in product revenue. After adopting the new standard, this revenue will now be reported in services revenue. The change in classification between products and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled services. After we file our 10-K, we will post a schedule to our Investor Relations website showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services in connection with the adoption of the new standard. The size of this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company revenue. And for clarity, this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. That goal remains unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting from products to services over that timeframe. Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives, and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged. As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow. As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past, given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line. Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming the other products category to wearables, home, and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the items that are included in this product category. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record. This range reflects a number of factors to be considered. First, we considered the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year. Second, we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds. Third, we have an unprecedented number of products ramping, and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply and demand balance. And fourth, we also face some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before discrete items. Also today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on November 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of November 12, 2018. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca, and we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?
Operator: Certainly. Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim, there has been some real deceleration in some of these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns around some of the rules the administration is contemplating and partly driven by things that are more specific to China, for instance, like some of the regulations around gaming. So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions and I have a follow-up.
Timothy Donald Cook: Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia. These are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. To give you a perspective in of some detail, our business in India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the previous year. And so I think, or at least the way that I see these, is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story, and I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone in particular was very strong, very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the overall company number. The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a moratorium, to be more accurate, on new game approvals. There is a new regulatory setup in China, and there things are not moving the way they were moving previously. We did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far below the historic pace. And as you've probably seen, some of the larger companies there that are public have talked about this as they've announced their earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will – the approvals will return to a normal pace, so I would not want to predict that. I do not view – just for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. I think that is strictly a domestic issue in China. In terms of larger developers, if you step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies in that equation. There's the user and there's the developer. If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is the best and safest place for users to get apps. And we have a tremendous process and infrastructure around achieving that. And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing over 100,000 apps per week between new apps and updates for existing apps, and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. And we also provide the user a one-payment model for purchasing apps and subscriptions and in-app purchases, et cetera, so that they are not in a position that they have to share their private information across many companies. And so that's the proposition for the user. For the developer, we obviously provide the developers a tremendous amount of developer tools, programs, compilers, languages, of course the operating system, APIs, SDKs, and have a huge developer relations team. And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today Editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations, search tools, and so on and so forth. And so there will be – there's no doubt in my mind there have already been some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their own. We're fine with that. I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest – if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps. And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is, and so that's the value proposition. I think that the vast majority of people are very happy with it, including the most important people at all, which is the user.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you, Tim. I appreciate the response.
Timothy Donald Cook: Yeah.
Wamsi Mohan: If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in healthcare, it's been growing significantly since the early introduction in the Watch and then the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit, et cetera. And when you combine that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, I see Apple could become a really large disintermediating force in all the friction in the healthcare industry today in the way medical information is shared and distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple in healthcare? And do you see a means to also grow your services business through the healthcare offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook: I think Apple has a huge opportunity in health. And you can see from our past several years that we have an intense interest in the space and are adding products and services, non-monetized services, so far to that. And I don't want to talk about the future because I don't want to give away what we're doing, but this is an area of major interest to us. Thank you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Shannon Cross from Cross Research has the next question.
Shannon S. Cross: Thank you very much for taking the question. Given the $4 billion range in revenue that you're giving for the quarter and all the things that are going on in the world right now, can you maybe give a little detail about the variables that you took into account when you were coming up with this? Geopolitical trade, macro, component costs, I don't know if you can just give us some ideas of what the puts and takes were. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Shannon, I'll take this one. At the revenue level, we started from the fact that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and services that we have getting into the holiday season. It's the strongest lineup that we've ever had. And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record. As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are a number of things that need to be considered as part of this guidance range. The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year, and that has had an effect on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1. Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone X, during Q1 and placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. This year, we launched the top end of the lineup, which is the XS and the XS Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in more pronounced ASP growth in Q4 of 2018 and obviously a tougher compare for Q1. So I think it's important to keep that in mind as you look at the revenue guidance that we provided. The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we're looking at 200 basis points of headwinds which translates, given our the size of our business, to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue. The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching, in the last six weeks, we've launched an unprecedented number of new products. They're all ramping right now. The ramps are going fairly well, but obviously we have some uncertainty around supply/demand balance for some of these products. And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets where clearly consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account and that's how we got to the range.
Shannon S. Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then, I just want to talk a little bit about the pullback in terms of guidance from a unit perspective. I understand you don't want to give guidance because of 90 days is a short period of time and it can fluctuate, but what kind of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be able to provide? Because it's obviously investors have spent the last however many years going P times Q. So, how should we think about what we can expect and sort of how are you going to manage this process as we go through? I know it's all our job to forecast, but.
Luca Maestri: Yes. Let me walk you through the rationale that we've used and then I'll talk about this qualitative commentary that you were mentioning. As I said, right, our objective is to make great products, provide the best customer experience, and get our customer satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem. When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. If you look at our revenue, given the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price here in the last three years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period. As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion, so unit of sale per se becomes less relevant. As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers, do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. But of course we understand that this is something of interest and when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.
Timothy Donald Cook: Looking at one additional point there just for clarity is, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing and so that our guidance isn't changing. It's the actual report that changes.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Mike J. Olson: Thanks very much and good afternoon. With the staggered iPhone launch, were you able to discern any impact on the XS and XS Max from buyers potentially waiting for the XR, and what if anything can we take away from the December quarter guidance related to what you're seeing for early demand of the XR? And then I have a follow-up, thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook: Mike, it's Tim. The XS and XS Max got off to a really great start and we've only been selling for a few weeks. The XR, we've only had out there for I guess five days or so at this point, and so we have very, very little data there. Usually there is some amount of wait until another product shows up and look, but in looking at the data, on the sales data for XS and XS Max, there's not obvious evidence of that in the data, as I see it.
Mike J. Olson: Got it, and you mentioned record levels for various components of the services business. As we look forward, if growth of services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what are the components of services that you're particularly excited about that could drive that and be the strongest drivers? And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around augmented reality has slowed a little bit in recent months. Is that potentially a materially contributor to services in the near future? Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Mike, as we said, during the September quarter, we set new records for many, many services categories, right, from Apple Music to cloud services to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now. When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters, so the opportunity for us to monetize our services business continues to grow over time. Of course, we're also improving the quality of the services that we provide and if you look back during the last three years, we've added new services to our portfolio. We added Apple Pay, we added Apple Music. We added this advertising business on our App Store. And clearly, we will want to continue to offer new services over time, so there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to grow the business over time. We have stated that we want to double the size of the services business from the level that we had in fiscal 2016 by 2020. We are well on pace to achieve that, and we feel very, very confident about the future and the opportunities that we have in the services space.
Timothy Donald Cook: Mike, in terms of your question on AR, I have a different view than you do on this one. Just a year ago, practically a year ago, we came out with ARKit 1. Six months or so after that we came out with 1.5. We then recently came out with ARKit 2. The number of things that you can do are growing significantly. The number of developers that either have done something, or even more the case, that are working on things that I've seen are growing tremendously. There's a lot of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping, to I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in an art sense, in an art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it being used in a historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of everywhere I go now, and so I think we are in the early days, and it'll keep getting better and better, but I'm really happy with where things are at the moment.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?
Operator: Next we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Thank you. Tim, given the current trade negotiations and broader geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider diversifying the supply chain? And if you were to do that, either on your own or sort of forced, do you think it would have significant impact on the business or profitability?
Timothy Donald Cook: Katy, if you look at the products that we have created and are manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. We have significant content from the U.S. market. We have content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from China as well, and so there are many hands in the products. The vast majority or almost all of the R&D is in the United States, as well as a lot of the support organizations. And so, I think that that basic model where you look around the world and find the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out of style, so to speak. I think there's a reason why things have developed in that way and I think it's great for all countries and citizens of countries that are involved in that. And I'm still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive that the discussions that are going will be fruitful. These relationships, these trade relationships are big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization. And so I'm optimistic that the countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth, can work these things out and work for the benefit of everyone.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: That's helpful color. And, Luca, as a follow-up, NAND prices fell significantly during the September quarter. Why aren't we seeing that flow through to margin expansion for the overall company?
Luca Maestri: You're referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty: Yes.
Luca Maestri: Let me give you the puts and takes, Katy. You're correct. We are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular. Memory on a sequential basis is about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. And obviously, we're going to be benefiting from the leverage, which is typical of our seasonality in the December quarter. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, and the impact that we expect at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is a 90 basis points headwind sequentially. And of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last six weeks. So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings on one side and FX and the new products on the other side.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Next, we'll go to Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much, a question for Tim and a question for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time, so you can decide who wants to go first or second. But operationally, Tim, I think your company is at a disadvantage relative to others in India, giving where items are produced versus shipped versus taxed versus installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you help us address that? Is India going to potentially be a big area, as I think you got about only about 1% market share, but it sounded like things may be softer there? And then for Luca, there will probably be a lot of pushback about not giving iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still going to give revenue data, if I heard that correctly, but some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year over year because it's easier to talk about great things and not show the details of things that aren't so great. So thank you very much, gentlemen.
Timothy Donald Cook: Okay, I'll start with India. We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country. We've been in discussions with them, and the discussions are going quite well. As you point out, there are import duties in some or most of the product categories that we're in. In some cases, they compound, and this is an area that we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. I am a big believer in India. I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well there. The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there, as you can tell from just looking at the currency trends, but I view these as speed bumps along a very long journey, though. And the long term I think is very, very strong there. There's a huge number of people that will move into the middle class. The government has really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold moves. And I applaud them for doing that and I can't wait for the future there.
Luca Maestri: And, Jim, let me take the question on units. First of all, as Tim said, our approach to guidance, providing guidance doesn't change at all. We continue to provide the same metrics that we were providing before. In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's in addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales, and therefore gross margins for both products and services. And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our services business, which we believe is an important metric for our investors to follow. Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have. But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past. To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported. And so therefore, we will, as I said, we'll provide qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant. But at the end of the day, we make our decisions from a financial standpoint to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars, and that we think is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors.
Timothy Donald Cook: Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color. Our installed base is growing at double digit, and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says how many units you have in there? It doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim.

72;AAPL;2019-01-30;"Operator: Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Nancy and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This isn't the first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter, so the first thing I want to do is provide some final results and connect those back to the letter we shared at the beginning of the month. As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion. That's down 5% from a year ago, or down 3% adjusting for foreign exchange. We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets. One of those factors, weak macro conditions in some emerging markets was significantly more severe than we originally foresaw, especially in Greater China. As our letter noted, that challenge was compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than we anticipated. We'll return to upgrades in a moment, but I'd first want to say a bit more about our business in Greater China. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac and iPad. Most of the shortfall relative to our original guidance and over 100% of our worldwide year-over-year revenue decline was driven by our performance in Greater China. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and our rest of Asia Pacific segment. We had record performance in large markets, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain and Korea. In the letter we shared earlier this month, we said we are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace and that we believe our business has a bright future there over time. But I think some of that got lost, so I want to share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China. We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5 million registered iOS developers. We saw very strong results from our wearables business there with revenues up over 50%. We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers. In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time. Finally, for perspective, despite the challenging December quarter, our revenue from China grew slightly for the full calendar year. Macroeconomic factors will come and go, but we see great upside in continuing to focus on the things that we can control. Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk about our results in the context of those lower than expected upgrades. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs, and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped. They share advanced technologies including the A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with our next-generation Neural Engine capable of 5 trillion operations per second. These are also completely modern iPhones with stunning large full screen displays and Face ID, the most secure authentication of any kind available in a smartphone. And the cameras are simply amazing with portrait mode and depth control to allow users to create studio quality photos as well as stunning 4K video, opening a whole new era of photography. We couldn't be more proud of our iPhone lineup and our industry-leading customer satisfaction. We wouldn't change our position for anyone. Now, our customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15% from last year. Our iPhone results accounted for significantly more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, outside of iPhone, our business grew strongly by 19%. So, what's behind this? It's important to understand what's going on from the customer perspective at the point of purchase. We believe that it's the sum of several factors. First, foreign exchange. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar has made our products more expensive in many parts of the world. In Turkey, for example, the lira depreciated by 33% over the course of calendar 2018 and in the December quarter, our revenue there was down by almost $700 million from the previous year. Second; subsidies. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. Competitive promotional activity frequently increase the amount of subsidy during key periods. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies as well as related competition. As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in Q1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies had come down as well. Third, our battery replacement program. For millions of customers, we made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their existing iPhones a bit longer. Some people have suggested that we shouldn't have done this because of the potential impact on upgrades, but we strongly believe it was the right thing to do for our customers. What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the main product categories and for all five of our geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast-growing Services business. In fact Services revenue set an all-time record at $10.9 billion in the December quarter growing 19%. We not only generated our highest global Services revenue ever, but we also had all-time records across multiple categories of Services including the App Store, Apple Pay, cloud services and our App Store search ad business and we had a December quarter record for AppleCare. And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes Store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers. The App Store wrapped up its best year ever with record holiday period results propelled by the biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever. Customers also spent over $322 million on New Year's Day alone setting us new single-day record for both the number of customers and purchase volume. It was also a great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8 billion transactions in the quarter well over twice the volume of the year-ago quarter. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestones. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations, while all Target Taco Bell and Jack-in-the-Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon. We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter Germany, Belgium and Kazakhstan and is now live in 27 markets around the world. The rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year. This is yet another example of what's possible when you bring together Apple's world-class hardware, software and ecosystem with our engaged and active user base. Shoppers around the world love Apple Pay and it has increasingly become an indispensable part of daily life. Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85 million monthly active users in the three countries where we've launched the United States, the U.K., and Australia. Here in the U.S., the latest data from Comscore shows that Apple News has the largest audience of all news apps. And the international audience will continue to grow with our first-ever bilingual launch in Canada available to customers later this quarter. In summary, we're very happy not only with the growth, but also the breadth of our Services portfolio. Our revenue from Services has grown from less than $8 billion in calendar 2010 to over $41 billion in calendar 2018. The largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth. We had our best quarter ever for Mac revenue which was up 9% fueled by our new MacBook Air and Mac Mini introduced in October. The MacBook Air includes a beautiful new Retina display, Touch ID and Force Touch Trackpad while the new Mac mini provides a powerful, flexible solution for everything from home automation to giant render forms. iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost six years powered by the new iPad Pro released in November with its edge-to-edge Liquid Retina display, Face ID and A12X Bionic chip, the new iPad Pro has been described by reviewers as a tablet with no equal and the most powerful mobile device ever made. We also had our best quarter ever for Wearables Home and Accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from Wearables, thanks to strong sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods. We don't measure our success in 90-day increments. We manage Apple for the long term and when we consider the keys to our success over time there are three that stand out, our highly satisfied and loyal customers, our large and growing active installed base and at the heart of it all, our deeply ingrained culture of innovation. Thanks to all this our ecosystem is stronger than ever before. We have an amazingly talented team creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. Apple Watch is a powerful example of that. It's humbling to read e-mails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions such as AFib and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS. We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities. Another example is the work we're doing with silicon. We've embedded machine learning directly into the silicon with our A12 Bionic chip. Our custom Neural Engine not only provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a very small package, but it also enables processing of data and transactions directly on the device. This means iPhone can recognize patterns make predictions and learn from experience and it does all this while keeping personal information private. This is a powerful example of how innovation and privacy can go hand-in-hand at a time when these issues are increasingly important to our users. We are undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve our results. It's not in our DNA to just stand around and wait for macroeconomic conditions to improve. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in an iPhone in our stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. Because of the quality and durability of iPhones, they maintain significant residual value making trade-ins a great opportunity. It's not only great for the environment, it's great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone and it's great for developers as a phone that is traded in and redistributed can help grow our active installed base. Beginning last week, we started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installed payments and we're working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as we can. We are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business and we have a very strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year. Apple innovates like no other company on earth and we are not taking our foot off the gas. We'll continue to invest through near-term headwinds just as we always have and we'll emerge stronger as a result. Now for more details on our December quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As Tim said, revenue for the December quarter was $84.3 billion. This result was below our expectations, but we were able to set new all-time revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and Korea. Our results were especially strong in the U.S. where revenue was up by more than $1.5 billion compared to a year ago and in several markets where revenue grew by double digits including among others Germany, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam. Looking at product categories. iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago while revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for Services, for Wearables and for Mac. Company gross margin was 38%. This quarter for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business. We are now reporting on a quarterly basis, gross margin for products in aggregate and for Services in aggregate. Products gross margin was 34.3% and Services gross margin was 62.8%. On a sequential basis, products gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter, partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange. While both products and services gross margins improved sequentially, total company gross margin was down 30 basis points due to a different mix between products and services. Net income was $20 billion about flat to last year and diluted earnings per share were an all-time record at $4.18, an increase of 7.5% over last year. Operating cash flow was also very strong at $26.7 billion. Let me provide more color for the various products categories. iPhone revenue was $52 billion. On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results. We also believe that the reduction of carrier subsidies and our battery replacement program had an impact in a number of countries around the world. And as Tim mentioned we had a lower number of upgrades than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. However, our global active installed base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December. We are disclosing that number now for the first time. And it has surpassed 900 million devices, up year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments and growing almost 75 million in the last 12 months alone. We plan to provide information on the iPhone installed base as well as total installed base on a periodic basis. Customer satisfaction and loyalty for iPhone continue to be outstanding and are the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the March quarter 81% plan to purchase iPhones. Based on the latest information from Kantar, iPhone experienced a 90% customer loyalty rating for iPhone customers in the U.S. 23 points above the next highest brand measured. Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year with new December quarter records in all five of our geographic segments. Many Services categories set new all-time revenue records and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020. To be clear and as we've already explained 90 days ago, our 2020 goal remains unchanged and it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019. The level of engagement of our customers in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double digits over last year. And we now have over 360 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus a year ago. Given the continued strength and momentum in this part of the business, we now expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020. Our subscription business has become very large and diversified covering many different categories from entertainment to health and fitness to lifestyle. In fact, more than 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available today on the App Store and the largest of them accounts for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to the new MacBook Air and Mac mini that we introduced in October, which helped drive a 9% increase in Mac revenue over last year to a new all-time record. Mac revenue was up in the vast majority of countries we track with double-digit growth in many large markets such as the U.S., Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Japan, Korea and South Asia. Our active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high and half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago. A strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro and generated double-digit growth in four of our five geographic segments. Similar to the Mac, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high and among customers purchasing iPad during the quarter half were new to iPad. The most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall, with iPad Pro models scoring as high as 100%. Among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 68% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home and accessories revenue grew 33% to a new all-time record in each of our geographic segments. Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter. Based on revenue over the past four quarters, our Wearables business is approaching the size of a Fortune 200 company. Our retail and online stores generated strong results for Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from Services and from Wearables. Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1. We added Thailand to our footprint with a beautiful store in Bangkok and we opened a stunning new store on Champs-Elysees in Paris exiting the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries. In enterprise, across multiple industries our technology continues to enable businesses to do their best work. In healthcare, iPhones and iOS apps continue to streamline and support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery across leading health systems including Johns Hopkins Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford Health Care and Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital. In manufacturing, SKF the world’s largest producers of bearings and seals, has transformed their manufacturing processes on iOS and iPhone with incredible success. With custom iOS apps available to production operators across their worldwide locations, SKF has reduced production errors from 20 percent to zero while saving 70% in system-related time. Apple technology has made possible a simplified user experience integrating the SAP cloud platform, yielding better accuracy, efficiency, and employee experiences across the board. We’re also seeing great innovation in the construction industry, with iPad and new third-party apps made for iOS. For instance, Procore Technologies has introduced an app to help decrease building errors on the job site. By using Metal in Split View with the iPad camera, construction workers can compare building plants and 3D models to what is actually being built in real time. This new iOS app reduces wasted raw materials and helps keep building projects on time and on budget. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $245 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.8 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of $130 billion. As we explained in the past, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $13 billion to our investors during the December quarter. We repurchased 38 million Apple shares for $8.2 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents. Consistent with our historical cadence, we plan to provide an update on our overall capital return program when we report our March quarter results. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I’d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $59 billion. This range reflects a negative year-over-year impact of $1.3 billion from foreign exchange, which represents about 210 basis points of last year's revenue and a more uncertain macroeconomic environment than a year ago, especially in emerging markets. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. On a sequential basis, this range reflects seasonal loss of leverage and a 60 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by commodity cost savings. We expect OpEx to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 17%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock, payable on February 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 11, 2019. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. And may we have the first question please?
Operator: Certainly. Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Services growth did decelerate from the growth rates in recent quarters, so can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? And then, appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers. But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next two years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So should we be thinking about services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow-up.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Katy, let me take that one. First of all, when we talk about the services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal 2016 to 2020, which implied at the time a 19% CAGR. So far, we've been able to grow about 20%. In fiscal 2018, we grew 22%. So we are on track to achieve our objective. And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. First of all, it's our installed base. As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December and really very little of our services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days. The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly. This is due to several factors. First of all, we're offering more and more services. During the last few years, as you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our developers on the App Store. All these businesses are growing very strongly. Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transact on our digital stores. We accept many more payment methods today which are very common in certain countries around the world. We've also increased the distribution coverage for many of these services. We're bringing AppleCare to more points of sale around the world. We are launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so on. Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large portion of our business and they're growing very well above services average. And the fact that we are saying that we will surpass 0.5 billion during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now. And this is an incredible staggering number, right, when you think about it. We are also broadening the scope of many of these services. If you take Apple Pay as an example, it started off as the most convenient, most private and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app. Then we took Apple Pay to Safari, then we started a peer-to-peer service and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter, so we are broadening that scope. And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last three years, we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users and we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us. I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter. And I think you're referring back to the growth that we reported in September. I think an important point I need to make, and I think it's helpful that you asked the question, is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under Products and now gets reported under Services. The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to a growing base. So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification. This factor by itself represents roughly one-third of the deceleration that you're seeing. We talked about 27% growth in the September quarter. With the reclassification that growth rate was about 24.5%. So that explains about a third of that deceleration. There are, I would say three factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%. The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. Roughly 60% of our Services business is outside the United States. And as you know the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis. The second factor is a well-known issue around the App Store in China. The App Store in China is a large business for us. We believe this issue around the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature, but clearly is affecting our business right now. And then thirdly, we are seeing some level of deceleration in AppleCare, which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal 2018, where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened when we increase the distribution coverage. But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.
Katy Huberty: Thank you for that color. Just a quick follow-up, Luca. Share repurchases in the December quarter were well below the run rate from the June and September quarters. How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level? And what should we think about is the right run rate going forward?
Luca Maestri: Well, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program. We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program. But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I will say, disciplined manner. And that takes into account also overall market conditions. So, that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. We -- our fundamental view remains the same. We are optimistic about our future and we think there is great value in our stock. And so we will continue to execute the program. We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our capital return program which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: The next question will come from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research.
Steve Milunovich: Great. Thank you very much. Some have the perception that you priced the new products, the new iPhones too high, what have you learned about price elasticity? And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit too far and might have to bring that down in the future?
Tim Cook: Steve, it's Tim. If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone Xs in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X a year ago. The iPhone Xs Max which was new was $100 more than the Xs. And then we priced the XR right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry iPhone 8 Plus have been priced. So, it's actually a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year. However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call and -- made that difference or amplified that difference in international markets, in particular the emerging markets which tended to move much more significantly versus the dollar. And so what we have done in January and in some locations and some products is essentially absorbed part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year and therefore get close or perhaps right on the local price from a year ago. So, yes, I do think that price is a factor. I think part of it is that, the FX piece. And then secondly in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. I had mentioned Japan, but also even in this country even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time. If you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases even a 7, you may have paid $199 for – and now in an unbundled world it's obviously much more than that. And so we are working through those and we've got a number of actions to address that including the trade-in and the installment payments which I had mentioned as well.
Steve Milunovich: I know that you're not giving units going forward, but you said you might make qualitative comments. I was wondering, if you have a comment particularly on the ASP on a year-over-year basis?
Luca Maestri: Well Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing of our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares. If you remember, our top models the Xs and Xs Max shipped during the September quarter, which plays the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter. While last year the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter, plays in the channel fill and initial sales in the December quarter. So we knew that this would create a difficult compare for Q1 of 2019 and this is essentially what happened. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. To give you more color I would say that, the XR is our most popular model and it's followed by Xs Max and then the Xs.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history. It also implies a year-over-year deceleration in iPhone revenues. And I'm wondering, if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory and maybe you can comment explicitly on that, or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse?
Luca Maestri: Yeah. I mean three questions there. The first one is a question around conservatism. As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within. We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right? I mean, we've been – we didn't miss in years and years. So that's the idea. There isn't a specific level of conservatism. We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within. On channel inventory, as you know our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that typically we increase inventory in Q1 and we decrease in Q2. And we think this year will be similar and we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. So that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1 from a revenue standpoint was minus 15%. And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about a bit more than two points versus last year's revenue and so that obviously plays a role. And the macroeconomic environment particularly in emerging markets will continue to be there. On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business which is not iPhone.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. Tim, at your September event Lisa Jackson, an Apple VP, stated the company needed to quote design products to last as long as possible. And Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products et cetera. But I guess the question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward in part because that's almost one of your objectives? And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhones' average replacement cycle might be today, and how that may have changed over the last three to five years. And again, why wouldn't you expect it to elongate over time given some of the aforementioned things? Thank you.
Tim Cook: We do design our products to last as long as possible. Some people hold onto those for the life of the product and some people trade them in. And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. And so it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other. The cycles -- the average cycle has extended. There's no doubt about that. We've said several times I think on this call and before, that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to the -- all the reasons that we had mentioned. So, where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user. And so that's the way that we look at it.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Services gross margin, up about 500 basis points it appears year-over-year. You talked a little bit about sequential. But what's driving the improvement or will it be volatile as we go through the year depending on quarters and mix? Just whatever color you can give us as we start to forecast this? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Shannon. I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount. Let me start with sequential because I think it's probably most relevant for us. Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points. It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. Some of these services are scaling quickly and so we tend to expand gross margins there. And also, we had favorable mix. As you probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of Services. Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them. For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis and therefore the gross margins tend to be accretive. But we also have services that are very successful, that are below the average for the services business. And so depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on services margins. But you've seen that for the last 12 months they've gone up nicely 450 basis points and sequentially they've gone up 170 basis points. But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this services gross margin is going to move over time. We will report of course at the end of every quarter. But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margin profiles within the portfolio. It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars. And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars we're going to be very pleased.
Shannon Cross: Okay, thank you. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about video? You've signed a myriad of deals. There was announcement about -- there are TV app directly on Samsung. So perhaps when this comes out you'll be multi-platform. I'm just curious how you view the opportunity in video. And I guess assuming, you can just leverage the costs that you've made already, it should be accretive to margin I would think?
Tim Cook: Yeah, Shannon, we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now. And we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years. And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways. One of those is through Apple TV and you're well familiar with that product. The second way is AirPlay 2, which we have as just pointed out we have support on a number of different third-party TVs. And we're excited about that. It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better. We think that people are really going to like that. Another way is, of course, all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store. We are participating in this today. And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle. And then finally, original content where we will participate in the original content world. We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But today I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in and they're working really hard and we'll have something to say more on that later.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: The next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.
Walter Piecyk: Great, thanks. I just have a question on the free services. Can you just describe how the math works on that? Is it that the free services are non cash revenue that's getting booked in the Services revenue with no cost and then the costs come out of products? Can you just run us through what the current status versus how you were accounting for that before?
Luca Maestri: Yes in essence when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption. We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free services. In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product. And so we calculate an estimated value. That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. In the past that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. Now in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products revenue to services revenue. So total revenue has not changed, we just report that estimated value under the Services category. We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. So the gross margin rate of these services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin. I hope I've...
Walter Piecyk: So it did make services gross margin, got it. And then my other -- my second question is just, when you think about growth in Services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 million going to 0.5 billion. If you can just talk at a high level as far as when you look at growth going forward, is it about -- what is the mix in terms of selling more to existing users, getting new users or -- and maybe some of the individual services that you see the biggest growth opportunity? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes. I mean as I said I mean essentially what -- services -- I said services too is our installed base. So the first driver is growing the installed base. Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years. We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone. So that's the first step. Then within that installed base, of course we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services. And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double-digits. So we want to continue to do that. We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services and so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. And clearly, as you said the idea of adding new services is very important to us. During the last three years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience. We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely. And we've added a very useful service to our developers. We provide an advertising service for developers in the App Store. The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future. Now we don't want to get into product announcements here, but obviously that is part of our strategy.

73;AAPL;2019-04-30;"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This has been an exciting and productive quarter for Apple. In my letter to investors at the beginning of January, I wrote that one of Apple's great strengths is our culture of flexibility, adaptability, and creativity. This quarter featured some important announcements that speak to the power of our commitment to innovation and long-term thinking. I'd like to start with some top-line highlights and then move into greater detail with you. I'll get started with financial results. Our revenue was $58 billion toward the high end of our guidance range. We see this result as a positive outcome in light of ongoing headwinds from weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In constant currency, our year-over-year revenue performance would have been 200 basis points better than our reported results indicate. We had great results in a number of areas across our business. It was our best quarter ever for Services with revenue reaching $11.5 billion. We had a blockbuster quarter for iPad, with revenue up 22% from a year ago. This is our highest iPad revenue growth rate in six years. And it was another sensational quarter for Wearables with growth near 50%. This business is now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when you consider it's only been four years since we delivered the very first Apple Watch. I'll talk more about these categories later. While we grew year-over-year in developed markets, and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets. But we feel positive about our trajectory. Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter, and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy, and improved trade dialog between the United States and China. Our App Store results are still reflecting the impact of the slowdown in regulatory approval in gaming apps in China, but we're encouraged by the recent increase in the pace of approvals. We believe strongly in our long-term opportunity in China, thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community, and the country's growing population of tech-savvy consumers who value the very best products and services. For iPhone, while our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter. Looking back at the past five months, November and December were the most challenging, so this is an encouraging trend. We like the direction we're headed with iPhone and our goal now is to pick up the pace. Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments, and set a new all-time record for all major product categories. That growing installed base is a reflection of the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, and it's driving our Services business to new heights. In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music cloud services, and our App Store search ad business, and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay transaction volume more than doubled year-over-year, and we're on track to reach 10 billion transactions this calendar year. Apple Pay is now available in 30 markets, and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year. More and more transit systems are accepting Apple Pay and New York's MTA system will begin the rollout in early summer. As we've seen in places like London, Tokyo, and Shanghai, contactless entry into transit systems helps to spur broader Apple Pay adoption, and we believe this will get even more people using Apple Pay in the United States. And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app, and over 50 of their entertainment and sporting event venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums. Subscriptions are a powerful driver of our Services business. We reached a new high of over 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, an increase of 30 million in the last quarter alone. This was also an incredibly important quarter for our Services moving forward. In March, we previewed a game-changing array of new services, each of them rooted in principles that are fundamentally Apple. They're easy to use. They feature unmatched attention to detail. They put a premium on user privacy and security. They're expertly curated, personalized, and ready to be shared by everyone in your family. These features aren't just nice to have. They actually help to eliminate the boundary between hardware, software, and service, creating a singularly exceptional experience for our users. First, building on the great momentum of Apple News, which is already the number one news app in the United States and the United Kingdom, we launched Apple News+. It will bring together over 30 popular magazines, leading newspapers, and digital publishers into a beautiful, convenient, and curated experience within the Apple News app. Apple News+ builds on our commitment to supporting quality journalism from trusted sources, while providing the best magazine and news reading experience ever for mobile devices. Advancing our vision to replace the wallet, we announced Apple Card built on principles Apple stands for like transparency, simplicity, and privacy. Apple Card is integrated into the Wallet app and delivers all new experiences that only Apple can provide integrating our hardware, software and services in an elegant solution that places the customer at the center. It's the first card to encourage you to pay less interest, eliminate fees, and give you daily cash on all your purchases and customer interest to date has been terrific. We also previewed Apple Arcade, the world's first game subscription service for mobile, desktop, and the living room. With over 100 new games, all with no ads or ad tracking, no additional purchases, and respect for user privacy, we've created a service for players of all ages, kids to teens to adults and one that families can enjoy together. The App Store is already the world's biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with a collection of new games not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service. We can't wait for our customers to experience it for themselves beginning this fall. We were thrilled to provide a peek at what's new for TV. Beginning in mid-May, the all-new Apple TV app will bring together the different ways to discover and watch shows, movies, sports news, and more in one app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, smart TVs, and streaming devices. And users can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels like HBO Showtime and Starz paying only for services they want all on-demand available on and offline. And coming this fall, Apple TV+ will be the new home for the world's most creative storytellers featuring exclusive original shows, movies, and documentaries. We also had several major product introductions during the quarter. We launched a new, more powerful iMac with dramatic increases in both compute and graphics performance, making it a great update for consumers and pros alike. For our Mac business overall, we faced some processor constraints in the March quarter leading to a 5% revenue decline compared to last year, but we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results. For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China while generating strong double-digit growth in each of our other geographic segments. Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched an all-new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support, and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip. In addition, we introduced a new iPad Mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans who love an ultra-portable design and like the new iPad Air, it delivers the power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil. Last month, we introduced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular wireless headphones and demand has been incredible. This is nothing less than a cultural phenomenon. With the new Apple-designed H1 chip, the new AirPods deliver faster connect times, more talk time, and the convenience of hands-free Hey Siri. Our retail and online stores continue to be a key point of innovation. As we mentioned in January, we've been working on an initiative to make it simple to trade in a phone in our store, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the old phone to the new phone. As part of this initiative, we rolled out new trade-in and financing programs in the U.S., China, the U.K., Spain, Italy, and Australia. The results have been striking. Across our stores, we had an all-time record response to our trade-in programs and with more than 4 times the trade-in volume of our March quarter a year ago. With each passing quarter, we're more inspired by the impact our products are having on people's fitness and health. This quarter, we brought the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 to Hong Kong and 19 European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. Just like when the ECG app launched in the United States, there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't get a letter or an e-mail from a customer in one of these countries talking about how this feature has significantly changed their life. We believe we're really just beginning to tap into what we can do to help our users actively manage their health and well-being. For example, last month Stanford Medicine reported results of the Apple Heart Study, the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 participants from all 50 states in a span of only eight months. And hundreds of institutions are now supporting health records on iPhone with recent additions including Michigan Medicine and UT Health Austin. In February, we announced that we are working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to make health records on iPhone available to veterans. This will be the first record sharing platform of its kind available to the VA, which is the largest medical system in the U.S. providing service to more than nine million veterans across more than 1,200 facilities. Apple's innovation extends beyond the impact we have in the lives of our customers to the impact we leave on the world around us. We recently marked Earth Day with several major announcements about our efforts to leave the world better than we found it. We've completed the allocation of our $2.5 billion green bond proceeds across 40 environmental initiatives around the world to projects ranging from solar power generation to water conservation to development of custom alloys for our products made from 100% recycled aluminum. We've announced a major expansion of our recycling programs, including quadrupling the number of locations where U.S. customers can send their iPhones to be disassembled by Daisy, our recycling robot. Each Daisy can now disassemble 1.2 million devices per year, allowing recovered materials to be recycled into the manufacturing process. And we partnered with a record number of our suppliers to follow our lead and transition to 100% clean energy. With the help of these 44 suppliers, we will exceed our goal of bringing four gigawatts of renewable energy into our supply chain by 2020 with over one additional gigawatt projected within that time frame. In the last calendar year alone, the partners that have joined this effort have generated enough clean energy to power over 600,000 homes in the United States. We're very proud of the progress that we and our partners are making, and hope our actions will inspire other businesses to do what they can to protect the world that we share. We are as excited as ever about our great pipeline of hardware, software and services and we're looking forward to sharing more information about the future of our four software platforms at our Worldwide Developer Conference now less than five weeks from now. Everyone here is hard at work to prepare for WWDC, and it's always a privilege to get to share the future of our platforms with the community of world changing developers who bring it to life. You are not going to want to miss this one. We're in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and invest confidently in our future, so today we're announcing the latest update to our capital return program including an increase to our share repurchase authorization and our quarterly dividend. For more details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago and down 5% from last year. Our revenue decline reflects 200 basis points of negative foreign exchange, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Overall, products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record. We also set a new March quarter record for Wearables Home and Accessories, and we recorded our best iPad growth rate in six years. Company gross margin was 37.6% in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 31.2% down about 310 basis points sequentially due to the seasonal loss of leverage and headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and leverage from higher revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.46 and operating cash flow was $11.2 billion. Let me provide more color for our various revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $31.1 billion. We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets, as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs. And our year-over-year performance improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the Americas and in Japan. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high at the end of March. This growing installed base reflects the industry leading satisfaction and loyalty of our customers. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers, who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to Services. As Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year. We generated double-digit revenue growth across the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. And we set all-time services revenue records in four of our five geographic segments. We're very happy with this performance. As you can see from our new disclosures, Services accounted for 20% of our March quarter revenue and about one-third of our gross profit dollars. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached another new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts, also setting a new all-time record and growing by strong double-digits over last year. And we now have over 390 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus just 12 months ago. All subscription categories are growing strong double-digits and as we mentioned a quarter ago, we expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020. On the App Store, our subscription business is extremely diversified and is growing strongly around the world. In fact, the number of paid third-party subscriptions increased by over 40% compared to last year in each of our geographic segments. And across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion a year ago with the decline driven primarily by processor constraint on certain popular models. In spite of this challenge, we generated double-digit Mac revenue growth in Japan and Korea setting new all-time Mac revenue records in both markets. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac and the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high. We had great results for iPad with $4.9 billion in revenue and growth accelerating from the December quarter to 22%. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments, with a return to growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth in all other segments. We had our best March quarter ever for iPad in Japan, and we were especially pleased by performance in Korea, Thailand and Mexico where revenue more than doubled over last year. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the March quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high. iPad revenue growth has been fueled primarily by the great customer response to our new iPad Pros. These completely redesigned iPads with full-screen Liquid Retina display, Face ID, powerful A12X Bionic chip with Neural Engine and support for the new Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard make iPad Pro the perfect PC laptop replacement for both consumers and professionals. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall. Among customers who plan to purchase tablets 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads. Wearables Home and Accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion fueled primarily by the strong performance of our Wearables business, which grew close to 50%. Within this category, Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world and produced its best results ever for a non-holiday quarter. It's reaching many new customers with three quarters of purchases going to customers who have never owned an Apple Watch before. Interest in AirPods has been off the charts and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible customer demand. Turning to our retail and online stores. We generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new Today at Apple sessions during the quarter in three new and expanded formats Skills, Walks and Labs free at our stores around the world. We're making important progress in the enterprise market, helping transform major industries. We're building on Apple's leading position in key functional areas to expand our reach and share within large accounts. Aviation is a strong example of this strategy at work. Across 450 airlines, iPad is overwhelmingly the preferred solution for the pilot's electronic flight bag. We've been making great progress expanding Apple's footprint beyond the cockpit into the cabin, where more than half of the top 50 airlines have now implemented iOS to enhance the guest experience as well as enable a new use case with mobile point-of-sale. We're also seeing traction with other mission-critical airline functions in ground operations and flight maintenance. For example, one of the largest airlines in the world tells us that the adoption of iPad has cut maintenance delays in half. Apple services are also making their way onboard, including growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in-flight access to Apple Music. We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms which are the face of complex back-end systems to tens of millions of employees around the world. The end user employee experience is vital to engagement and productivity and with increasing mobility of today's modern workforce, those experiences are best on native iOS applications. We see great momentum through the growing number of iOS SDKs being delivered by the world's largest enterprise platforms. For instance, SAP's SDK for iOS continues to gain strong traction with their customers, growing by more than 40% in the last six months. And this past quarter Salesforce released its SDK enabling developers to build native iOS applications directly on top of the Salesforce platform. And finally, our enterprise channels continue to build momentum. In February, our Apple at Work initiative was launched with AT&T. This extension to our ongoing collaboration with AT&T will make it easy for more customers to choose the best Apple products for their needs in the enterprise and modernize their business. AT&T will enable business services for Apple products to help companies with their IT strategy, including device management, security, productivity and collaboration. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $225 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We also had $101 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of almost $113 billion. As a result, we are in a very strong position that allows us to invest confidently in all areas of the business, while continuing to return value to our shareholders. Just last year, we announced a commitment to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, including the creation of 20,000 jobs. More recently, we've announced a major expansion in Austin Texas and in other cities across the country. All these efforts are essential investments to make sure that we're incorporating innovative ideas and top talent wherever they emerge. As we execute those initiatives, we are also able to return over $27 billion to investors during the March quarter. We began a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program in February, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 55.1 million shares. We also repurchased 71.7 million Apple shares for $12 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents. Our priorities for cash have not changed over the years. Most importantly, we always want to maintain the cash we need to run our business, maintain strategic flexibility, and invest in our future. We're well on our way towards meeting the investment projections we laid out early last year. We also want to work towards a more optimal capital structure and as we said before, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. Given our confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases. And because we know many of our investors value income, we're also raising our quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than seven years to $0.77, an increase of about 5% from the previous amount. We paid over $14 billion in dividends and equivalents over the last four quarters alone, making us one of the largest dividend payers in the world. Going forward, we continue to plan for annual increases in dividends per share. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion. This guidance range comprehends 300 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. Also as a reminder, in the June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also reflecting the approved increase, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on May 16, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2019. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?
Operator: Certainly. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in China? Clearly, it looks like things are improving sequentially. You also mentioned that last few weeks of the quarter, were stabilizing in emerging markets, I believe. So what are customers saying there and what are your partners saying in China? And then I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Shannon. We're seeing -- in the iPhone space, we saw a better year-over-year performance in the last weeks of the quarter as compared to the full quarter or November and December, which was sort of a -- it appears to be the trough. I think there's a set of reasons for this. One, we made some price adjustments essentially backing out the weaker currency effect and then some. There's stimulus programs that the government has executed including -- and this happened in early April, VAT being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus side. Three, our trade-in and financing programs that we’ve implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the results to date there. And then four, there's an improved trade dialog between the U.S. and China. And from our point of view, this has affected consumer confidence on the ground there in a positive way. And so, I think it's a set of all of these things and we certainly feel a lot better than we did 90 days ago.
Shannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And then, I'm sure you're probably expecting a question on Qualcomm settlement. So what would you like to say on this settlement? How are you thinking about your component providers going forward? And how should we think about this with regard to -- I don't know your development plans in the future because I'm sure you're not going to talk about when you're going to do 5G, but clearly it helps that path. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all the litigation around the world has been dismissed and settled. We're very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement, and we're happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was I know important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked about China responding well to these pricing actions that you've taken in that market. Do any of those learnings kind of carry through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets, like India, et cetera as you get ready for the next product cycle?
Tim Cook: We have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there. Everything that we do does advise everything we do in the future, so we try to learn the best we can and hold [ph] that into our thinking, and we'll obviously do that with this as well.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up for Luca on the Services side. Luca, we see that you're guiding to higher operating expenses quarter-on-quarter. How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?
Luca Maestri: Yeah. Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters. Clearly as we add new services, we will need to make the necessary investments to support them. Our Services business has multiple streams. In total, it is accretive to company gross margins. You've seen the latest -- we're running services margins at over 60%. So, it's a very important business for us in many ways for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it. And so, clearly we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful, and we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Samik. Can we have the next question please.
Operator: The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Luca, if I look back over the past five years, June quarter revenue typically declines about 15% from the March quarter. You're guiding to an 8% drop this year. So can you just talk about, which regions or product segments you think can outperform that typical seasonality?
Luca Maestri: Yes, Katy. And keep in mind by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, so actually in constant currency the numbers would be even stronger. At the product category level, we expect that we will continue to have strong revenue growth from the non-iPhone categories as we've had for the first half of our fiscal year. We're also expecting a relative improvement in our iPhone performance on a year-over-year basis in Q3 versus the first half. As Tim said, March was the strongest month of the quarter on a year-over-year basis and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that you've seen. Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but we believe the trajectory should improve over time.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, Shannon said you're not going to talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim maybe you can talk about how the company approaches a new technology like this given the higher cost but also potentially significant benefit, how you think about the right timing for coming to market with a product, with those characteristics? And then just generally how meaningful you think 5G is as a demand driver for upgrades in your iPhone installed base? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Katy, this is one that I'm going to largely punt on as you would probably guess. We look at a lot of things on the different technologies and try to look at the -- and select the right time that things come together and get those into products as soon as we can. And the -- certainly from a cost point of view there has been -- the technologies have had cost pressure over the last couple of years or so. On the flip side of that there's a number of things in the commodity markets going in the other direction at the moment like DRAM and NAND. And so it's difficult to project what happens next, but it's the aggregate of all of it that really matters from a price point of view.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. So we have the next question, please.
Operator: Jim Suva from Citi has our next question.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim and Luca on a response, but I'll ask the question and you can decide how to divide it up. In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe it was Tim also. Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah. Jim, in the opening remarks I was really talking about China specifically. And I mentioned four things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average. And those four are the price reductions, but that's one of them. But there are three others and one of the others is the trade-in and financing programs that we instituted in our retail stores. Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade-in their current phone. It does -- from a customer user point of view the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. And many people in literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once. And so, it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those. The other two items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. And the one that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move. But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level. And then finally -- and this is not to be under weighted either -- I think the improved trade dialogue between the countries affects consumer confidence in a positive way. And so, I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.
Luca Maestri: And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level as we look at pricing actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action it is gross margin percentage diluted. But what really matters to us and what we look at -- when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our gross margin dollars. And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect and so that's what we think matters the most really.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much, gentlemen.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim. We have the next question, please.
Operator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes. Thank you. Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade-ins, but I was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're seeing across your installed base on these trade-ins. What type of devices are being traded in? Is the profile of someone who has a really old iPhone? Or are you seeing folks that have newer iPhones trading in? And what sort of incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? And do you see this as something that can accelerate replacement cycles here over the next year or so? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: We're -- actually the product that's being traded in is all over the place, to be honest. It's 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and then fewer 8 and 8 Plus. But there's some of each of those and so you get customers that are on the two-year cycle and customers -- some customers on the one-year cycle and then customers as well on the three and four-year cycles. And so it's really all over the place. In terms of the incentives we're offering currently in our retail stores a trade-in value that has -- that is more than the sort of the blue book of the device if you will for lack of a better description. And so we have topped those up to provide an extra benefit to the user. The installments are different in each geography. I would say that at the moment the geography that is doing the best in installments would be China. And we have a bit of a unique offering there I think versus the -- versus what you can get in the regular market and so that probably further helps there. And so you can bet that we're learning on each of these finding the parts that the user likes the most. I think the key is we're trying to build a -- build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade in their current device on a new device. And we do our best of getting the current device to someone else that can use that or in some cases if the product is at an end of life we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form.
Wamsi Mohan: Thanks for the color Tim. And as my follow-up Luca can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near-term? And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: As Tim has explained we've reach this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. As part of this we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that. What you see in our gross margin guidance for the June quarter we guided 37% to 38% fully comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray has our next question.
Mike Olson: Thanks for taking my question. So, you have more than 1.4 billion active devices and at your event you announced services that leverage that installed base. And you have obviously a remarkable position with kind of this Trojan horse of devices out in so many households. So, I guess, the question is and I know some of these services aren't even live yet but should we expect a continuation of the building out of new services categories like what we saw at the March event? Is there a pipeline of new services in the works? Or have we kind of seen what we're likely to see on that front for the near to intermediate term? And then I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Yes, I wouldn't want to get into announcing things on the call, but obviously, we're always working on new things. And -- but we're right now we're really focused on getting these four out there. We have the News+ in the market today. We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the market in the fall and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. And so we've got lots in front of us and we're very excited about getting these out there.
Mike Olson: Right. And then you mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Is that reaching a point where it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall services revenue? Or is there anything you can quantify related to that? I also imagine that this is a high-margin business at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin but wondering if you can confirm if that's the case or not. Thanks.
Tim Cook: It's growing very, very fast Mike. I think it was up around 70% over the previous year. We're expanding into new geographies as well and we still have more geographies out there that we think can move the dial further. So, it is a -- it's definitely a business that is big and getting bigger.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets.
Louis Miscioscia: Okay and thank you for taking my question. Tim, when you look at the four things that you have announced. And I realize they have different dates when they're coming out but, which ones would you say over the next 12 months has the most potential to help your Services line? And then maybe, which one has the best long-term potential? And then, I have a quick follow-up.
Tim Cook: We're going to wait until we get these things out. And what I can tell you right now is that the -- we're taking sort of consumer interest on the Apple Card and there's been a significant level of interest on that and we're excited. As you know the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store. And so the Apple Arcade will serve some of that market. And it serves it with a different kind of game, which we think will be great for developers and great for users. The TV+ product plays in a market where it's -- there's a huge move from the cable bundle to over the top. We think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products. And we're going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product should be one of them. And then, we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a look. Because we think it's a very unique product. And I love magazines. And we have really wanted to support the publishers. And so, we're working very hard to -- at the -- but at the very beginning of the ramp there. We wouldn't do a service…
Louis Miscioscia: Okay, great.
Tim Cook: …that we didn't think could be meaningful. So that's sort of the way I look at it.
Louis Miscioscia: Great.
Tim Cook: Yeah, these aren't hobbies.
Louis Miscioscia: Okay. A quick follow-up on India, obviously market share there is well below China. I believe you're looking to start manufacturing there. But what's the -- obviously the potential could be huge but the market already seems to be pretty dominated on the Android side, so maybe if you could just talk about trying to really aggressively ramp up share there. Thank you.
Tim Cook: I think India is a very important market in the long-term. It's a challenging market in the short-term. But we're learning a lot. We have started manufacturing there which is very important to be able to serve the market in a reasonable way. And we're growing that capability there. And we would like to place retail stores there. And we're working with the government to seek approval to do that. And so, we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might. We've opened a developer, accelerator there, which we're very happy with some of the things coming out of there. It's a long-term play. It's not something that's going to be on overnight huge business. But I think the growth potential is phenomenal. It doesn't bother me that it's primarily Android business at the moment because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there.

74;AAPL;2019-07-31;"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Tim Cook: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today.We're thrilled to report a return to growth and new June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion. We saw significant improvement in year-over-year iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for both Mac and iPad and absolutely blowout quarter for Wearables, but we had accelerating growth of well over 50% and a new high watermark for services, where we set an all time revenue record of $11.5 billion. When you step back and consider Wearables and services together two areas where we have strategically invested in last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company.Geographically, we are happy with our performance across the board including a return to growth in Mainland China. We accomplished these results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange which impacted our top-line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a year ago that's equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue. Importantly, in constant currency, our revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments.For iPhone, we generated $26 billion in revenue, while this is down 12% from last year's June quarter, it is a significant improvement to the 17% year-over-year decline in Q2. We are encouraged by the results we are seeing from the initiatives that we spoke about in January including strong customer response to our in-store trade-in and financing programs.In fact, iPhone our retail and online stores returned to growth on a year-over-year basis in the month of June. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories. Starting with services, we generated all time record revenue of $11.5 billion that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15% or 18% in constant currency which is consistent with our Q2 performance. Our strong services performance was broad based, we set new all-time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services and our app store search ad business and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the app store.What's more, we had double-digit services revenue growth in all five of our geographic segments. We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform and we remain on track to double our fiscal year '16 services revenue in 2020.In May, we launched our all new Apple TV app in over 100 countries bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and select smart TV's. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year.We've seen our success being driven here by several factors. First, the fact that we have been able to integrate content from over 150 leading content providers all in one place. Second, the same ease-of-use and unmatched user interface that sets Apple apart in other categories sets us apart in TV as well. And third, we're benefiting from a broader secular move to over-the-top services.We're engaging with this third trend in five ways. Our Apple TV hardware, Apple TV channels where customers can choose to pay only for the channels they want. Our massive library of over 100,000 iTunes movies and TV shows, the app store where users can find their favorite streaming services and later this year, our original programming service Apple TV+.Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month more than twice the volume of a year ago. Apple Pay launched in 17 countries in the June quarter completing our coverage in the European Union and bringing us to a total of 47 markets currently. Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal and monthly transaction volume is growing 4x as fast.In the United States, in addition to a successful integration into Portland's transit system in May, we're beginning to rollout of New York City transit and will launch in Chicago later this year. In China, Apple Pay launched the payment card for Didi the world's largest ride hailing provider.As I've said before, transit integration is a major driver of a broader digital wallet adoption, and we're going to keep up this push to help users leave their wallet at home in more and more instances.On a related note, thousands of Apple employees are using Apple Card every day in our beta test, and we plan to begin the rollout of Apple Card in August.As I mentioned at the outset, it was another sensational quarter for Wearables, with growth accelerating to well over 50%. We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users. Over 75% of customers buying Apple Watch in the June quarter were buying their first Apple Watch. We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods. And when you tally up the last four quarters, our wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.We had great performance from iPad, with revenue of over $5 billion, and growth driven by iPad Pro and by strong customer response to the new iPad Mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth, and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there's an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook lineup in the last couple of months. We now have a $999 MacBook Air that is killer for college students. And for our pro users, who push the limits of what a Mac can do, we were thrilled to unveil the most powerful Mac ever, the new Mac Pro and the all new Pro Display XDR, which will be available this fall. They're designed for maximum performance, expansion and configurability and at breakthrough pricing and they're the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of pro customers.What's more, the Mac ecosystem as a whole is about to get a big boost. At our recent Worldwide Developers Conference, we announced a game-changing tool to help developers easily adapt their iOS and iPadOS apps for the Mac. I'll have a bit more to say on that in a moment.I'd like to provide some color on our performance in Greater China, where we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and return to growth in constant currency. We experienced noticeably better year-over-year comparisons for our iPhone business there than we saw in the last two quarters and we had sequential improvement in the performance of every category. The combined effects of government stimulus, consumer response to trade-in programs, financing offers, and other sales initiatives and growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem had a positive effect. We were especially pleased with a double-digit increase in services driven by strong growth from the App Store in China.Turning to the future. Last week we announced an agreement with Intel to acquire the majority of its smartphone modem business. This is our second-largest acquisition by dollars and our largest ever in terms of staff. We're looking forward to welcoming all of them to Apple. We see this as a great opportunity to work with some of the leading talents in this field, to grow our portfolio of wireless technology patents to over 17,000, to expedite our development of our future products and to further our long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products that we make.We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements of great new features coming this fall across our four software platforms making them more powerful, more personal and more private.For iPhone users, iOS 13 will take on a dramatic new look with Dark Mode, while delivering major updates to the apps you use every day, including photos, camera and maps. iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including Sign On with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and Web sites without sharing your personal information. And improvements across the entire system will make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before.For the first time, iPad is getting its own version of iOS, called iPadOS, a strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level. The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended and interactive second monitor for your Mac.For Apple TV, tvOS 13 will make the big-screen experience even more personal. With a redesigned home screen and multi-user support, everyone in the family can get a more engaging and tailored experience with their favorite TV shows, movies, sports and news, along with Apple Music, photos and videos in iCloud, and an App Store with thousands of great games and apps.watchOS 6 is a major step forward in helping Apple Watch users stay healthy, active and connected. Apple Watch now has a dedicated App Store that users can access directly from the device and new watch faces, Siri enhancements, and music and audio features make Apple Watch more useful than ever. And of course, we continue to innovate on Apple Watch's promise to be an intelligent guardian for your health. watchOS 6 includes powerful new features like notifications that warn about high decibel noise to protect your hearing and cycle tracking to aid in women's health care decisions.In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and a regular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world, with more to come later this year. We're very proud of the muscle we've built in bringing regulated products like these to market. This is an important competency that creates exciting opportunities for us moving forward.As I noted earlier, we believe macOS Catalina will be a breakthrough in the Mac ecosystem. A new tool included in macOS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. Thousands of developers are already using it to bring their apps to the Mac ecosystem and we expect to see a wave of popular apps arriving for the Mac as early as this fall.Again, it's worth taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here. These updates are the latest steps in a broader strategic effort to make the user experience across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS more effortless and more intuitive. Apple is alone in offering this kind of value and ecosystem to its customers. And these devices and their platforms are unmatched in their ease-of-use, their seamlessness and their privacy and security.And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where developers benefit greatly from creating for and distributing on these platforms. And our customers, of course, benefit greatly from access to all this creativity and innovation.We also unveiled other exciting technologies to make it easier and faster for developers to create powerful new apps. SwiftUI provides an intuitive new framework for building sophisticated user interfaces across our software platforms using simple easy-to-use code. Core ML 3 supports the acceleration of more types of advanced real-time machine learning models, and Create ML lets developers build machine learning models without writing code.We have the world's largest augmented reality enabled platform and thousands of they ARKit-enabled applications in the App Store. Building on this strategy, and our momentum in this area, we introduced three new AR-based technologies. ARKit 3 uses on device, real-time machine learning to recognize the human form and integrates people seamlessly into AR experiences.RealityKit is a new developer framework built from the ground up to provide all the tools and technologies required to make AR objects virtually lifelike. And Reality Composer brings AR content creation to tens of millions of developers who have no 3D experience. Our developers are already running with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps that these creators have in store in the months ahead.On so many fronts there's an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services like Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and Apple Card. And without giving too much away, we have several new products that we can't wait to share with you.Until then, thanks for joining us today. And for more details on the June quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone.We're happy to report a June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year. We return to growth in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment around the world, which impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 300 basis points. We set June quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and as Tim mentioned earlier all our geographic segments grew in constant currency.Overall, products revenue was $42.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year, which is significantly better than the 8% decline in products revenue that we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year.Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in Wearables, Mac and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion. Excluding the one-time item, we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 15% and 18% in constant currency terms.On a geographic basis, we saw marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries, where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter.We set June quarter revenue records in several major developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia and Korea. In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and Brazil and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially and in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 30.4% down about 80 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and product mix partially offset by favorable cost. Services gross margin was 64.1%, up 30 basis points sequentially, primarily due to a favorable mix. Net income was $10 billion, diluted earnings per share were $2.18 and operating cash flow was $11,600,000,000.Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $26 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago. This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter's 17% decline, with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets. Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all time high in each of our geographic segments and in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research, indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 10R, iPhone 10S and 10S Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records with all-time records in the Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific.In total, services accounted for 21% of Apple revenue and 36% of gross margin dollars.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all time high in the June quarter and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year. We now have over 420 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platforms and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.On the App Store, our growth accelerated sequentially. Our subscription business continues to grow strongly and is extremely diversified across many categories such as entertainment, lifestyle, photo and video and music. Third-party subscription revenue grew by over 40% and across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.25% of total services revenue.Among our many services records, it was our best quarter ever for AppleCare. We are seeing an increase in service contract attach rates and are expanding distribution of AppleCare through our partners. We also recently expanded our authorized service provider network and nearly 1000 Best Buy stores across the U.S. are now offering expert service and repairs for Apple products. This expansion provides customers with an even more convenient access to repairs using parts certified for safety, quality and reliability. In addition to Apple retail stores there are over 1800 third-party Apple authorized service providers in the U.S., which is 3x as many locations as three years ago.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Mac revenue grew in 4 of our 5 geographic segments and set June quarter records in the U.S., Europe and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpaced the global PC industry. Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all time high.We also had great results for iPad, with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%. iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments, with a Q3 revenue record in Mainland China and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all time high.The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, home and accessories revenue accelerated across all our geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion and setting a June quarter record. This growth was fueled primarily by the strong performance of our wearables business, which was up well over 50% and has become the size of a Fortune 200 company over the last 12 months. In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and accessories during the quarter.Our retail and online stores produce their best June quarter revenue ever, with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and accessories. Our trade-in program is showing great momentum, with more than 5x the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago. We opened stunning new stores in the Carnegie Library in Washington D.C. and the busy Shinji District in Taipei as well as a beautiful new location in the Dallas Galleria. We ended the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries alongside our online store presence in 35 countries.In the enterprise market, we are gaining traction with our strategy of transforming major industries by expanding our leading positions in key functional areas to grow our reach and modernize customer and employee experiences.In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by assets size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations. iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go. For example, 60% of the biggest banks are supporting iPads for wealth managers.In retail banking, two-thirds of top banks are deploying iPad for branch transformation and modernizing legacy interfaces with a unified iPad experience. One of the world's largest banks created an iPad suite that reduced customer on-boarding time from more than an hour to just 12 minutes. Bank branch employees are also using Apple Watch for communication and notifications and Apple TV for customer presentations from iPads using AirPlay.Financial institutions also tell us that they receive positive feedback from leveraging Apple solutions for direct customer engagement. American Express, Credit Suisse, Discover and T.D. Ameritrade have launched Apple Business Chat as a dynamic way to support and interact with customers.The intuitive interface of messages on iOS enables rich communication between customers and contact center staff. T.D. Ameritrade has also become the first brokerage in the world to enable immediate funding of accounts using Apple Pay, eliminating the 2 to 3 business days it used to take to fund accounts by wire transfer.Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $211 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and reduced commercial paper by $2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $102 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open-market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.We expect revenue to be between $61 million and $64 billion. This guidance includes almost $1 billion of year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OINE to be about 200 million and we expect our tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2019.With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please.
Operator: The first question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, two from me. First off, could you just talk about, when I think about the September quarter guide, it's implied I think up 16% or so sequentially. Historically, at least, in that guide has been in the 10% low double-digit kind of range. Just can you help us understand, what gives you the confidence for a better than seasonal guide in September, either from a geo or product basis would be helpful.
Luca Maestri: Amit, it's Luca. Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will land. Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iPhone categories. We have great momentum in wearables. We mentioned that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter, or actually over 50% in the June quarter. Our services business, we set an all-time record in June. And so, these two categories have become really important and really large for us. And so, as we continue to grow, quickly that is going to help us as we go through the year. Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough. That's really helpful. And I guess if I just follow-up on China, impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing that despite all the headlines that are out there. Just curious, what are the few things that are driving the success in China, and how sustainable do you think those changes are for Apple as you go forward.
Tim Cook: Yes, Amit, Hi. It's Tim, and I apologize for my voice, I'm suffering from an allergy. But what happened last quarter in China was a confluence of things. The government stimulus, this came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. We took some pricing action, we instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well. And we're seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter. And so, when you look at it, each of our categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables, services, everything improved sequentially. So, we couldn't be happier with the progress. I would point out, I think I mentioned in my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency for Greater China and we grew in Mainland China on a reported basis. So, there's several things going on there that are quite positive.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please.
Operator: The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about what's going on within services, some of the puts and takes? Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that, but I'm just curious and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunity, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of what’s been going on with China and that, is this something that could reaccelerate, or again, the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. But, how are you thinking about it?
Luca Maestri: Yes. I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, Shannon. Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the one-time item from last year, was 15%. Clearly FX, plays a role around the world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. Our installed base continues to grow. It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the services business.I would say, I'll give you a bit more color around two offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. In China, we saw significant acceleration. As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter. That has helped our performance there.On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. And obviously, as we go through the year those comps become a bit more difficult.Having said all that, that we've given ourselves a couple of targets and we feel very confident about reaching those targets. The first one is that, we wanted to double the size of the services business from our fiscal 2016 to 2020. We are on our way there. Paid subscriptions is another target, is important to us. It's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. We’re already at 420 million now. So, we feel confident there.And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. As Tim said, we're starting the rollout of Apple Card in August, and there's two more very important services that we’re going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and then of course Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. So obviously these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we had in services.
Shannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And this is probably for you too as well, Luca. Can you talk about gross margin? The guidance was pretty solid. Obviously, there are various things that are at play here. I know you mentioned $1 billion worth of top-line impact, I think from, currency last quarter. Then maybe if you can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance.
Luca Maestri: Yes. So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage. As you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings, because as you know the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. And so, we need to keep that in mind. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks Shannon. Could we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Yes. Thank you. I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the quarter and understand what linearity looked like. I ask because there was some industry data around the smartphone market in China that seemed to deteriorate in the month of June, the App Store data deteriorated a little bit in June, and just curious if that’s something you saw in the business and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China business as you go into September.
Tim Cook: Katy, it's Tim. We obviously took into account all of the information that we had and coming out with the guidance including linearity across last quarter and how this quarter has started. And so, we obviously look at that in quite much detail.
Katy Huberty: And then just on the App Store, appreciate there's not a lot of detail out around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services, but how should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting the overall services growth. Does that start to benefit the model in the back half of this calendar year, or will the impact be more longer term in nature and really show up in 2020?
Luca Maestri: Katy, let me just talk about the new services that we've announced in March, and then also about the timing of how we get to revenue, right? We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for consumers right now. We've announced our channel service, which has also become available a few weeks ago. The other three services, the card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period up front, there's going to be different trial periods, we'll see what that what they look like. So, the road to monetization takes some time. Obviously, all of them will add to our base and will help us with growth rates as we get into next year.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.
Krish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, on the iPhone trade-in program, how effective was it and what percentage of the iPhone sales came from the trade-ins and are there any other geographies where you are left to rule it out? Then, I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Hi, it's Tim. In retail, it was quite successful. We got going in a larger way during that quarter, we were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. And trade-in as a percentage of their total sales is significant and financing is a key element of it. Those two things in the aggregate led the combination of retail and online, just short form that is retail Apple Store let to growth in June trajectory. We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely and that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies. Because we're working with our carrier partners on those and retail partners.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. That's pretty helpful, Tim. And then, a follow-up for you, a much longer-term question. I understand we're in the very early innings of the services growth story. Is there a way to think about it down the road, 3 or 5 years down the road, would the services growth still be tethered to the hardware of the iPhone, or do you think at some point down the road services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware installed base?
Tim Cook: Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV. We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. And so we'll see what we do in the future. I don't want to really get into that.But, more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is, we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever, we've got new products on the way, the pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the product and the services side. We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. The installed base is growing, hit a new record, that's obviously good. And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all categories. And so, this is a really good thing.And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. We stuck with that when others perhaps didn't and really put a lot of energy into this and a lot of R&D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out what's next there.At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration. And during the quarter tactically the emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. We still declined on a reported basis. India bounced back. During the quarter, we returned to growth there. We're very happy with that. We grew in Brazil as well.We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. Luca mentioned some of this in his comments and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. And then, we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets and bet that we have a big future, in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the watch. And so hopefully that kind of gives you a view over the total.And so, we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales mostly, very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means there. They're more correlated to the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Krish. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Next, we will go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim, the China trade situation remains sort of fluid over here and more recently you asked for some tariff exceptions were not granted those. How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing and can you talk about any potential alternatives that you've looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of China. And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Yes. I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. The way I view this is, the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain. Largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well.In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S., we want to continue doing that. And so, we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so, because we want to continue to be here. And so that's what's behind the exclusions. And so, we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And there is, Luca, maybe for you, there's been some significant destocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year in iPhone. Can you comment about the broader channel inventory levels where you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June iPhone sales being quite strong and do you expect anything atypical in channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Wamsi, as you know we're not getting into this topic very much. But, I think I can give you some color here. You know that in general, we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. That has been traditionally what we've done. This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for Greater China as well. So, we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. Hope that helps you with that.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thanks very much. The first question is probably to Tim and second one for Luca. I will ask them at the same time, so you can continue which other one you want to answer, first or second. While the first one is for Tim, regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year the past several quarters have been down. Can you help us bridge the gap of, how is the installed base growing? Is it mostly because secondary users are the new ones coming into the system as people are holding more phones longer? And what does that user typically bring in with them or something unique relative to what we historically know?And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot and a lot of these services are now coming to pass whether it be AppleCare, Apple Cloud, all these wearables and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. Are we at a point where now a lot of harvesting is going to happen or do you kind of continue this relatively same investment that you've been doing for the future strategy. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Hey, Jim, it's Tim, I'll start with your installed base question. Installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those. It's a function of the number of switchers coming into the to the iOS, macOS and so forth [indiscernible]. It's a function of the robustness of the secondary market, which we think overwhelmingly hits an incremental customer. And it's a function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets to a lesser degree of people knew that they’re buying their first smartphone. There are still quite a few people in the world in that category. And so, the reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90-day clock is that what's happening underneath the numbers is, switchers are still a very key piece of what's going on. The secondary market is very key, and we're doing programs et cetera to try to increase that, because we think we wind up hitting a cost number that we don't hit in another way.And the upgrades where people are holding onto their device a bit longer than they were, they're staying in the ecosystem. And then, you have the people in the new category as well. And so, that's sort of the equation. I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.
Luca Maestri: And Jim, on OpEx, obviously is very important for us to continue to invest in the business, particularly on the R&D side, because we will always want to bring more innovation into the market. We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. So, we will continue to do that. There are some types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition. Very important strategically for us. It requires upfront investment, of course.As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. Of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and Apple Card next month, obviously they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public.When you look in total, where we are in terms of our expense to revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know, quite well that we are extremely competitive relative to other tech companies. So, we want to continue to be competitive and at the same time we will not under-invest in the business.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start-off with the announcement at WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch and the iPad. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores? And how does that help you position wearables more firmly into the health and fitness category?
Tim Cook: We're seeing good interest across virtually everything that we announced at WWDC. I couldn't be happier with it. The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. And so, you look at all of these and all the things that I talked about earlier and I couldn't be happier with the reception that we're getting and the work that is going on behind the scenes right now for the developers readying their apps for the fall.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. If I can just follow-up on the China market, one of the things that we're looking at is going into the New Year into 2020 there'll be a lot of 5G phones launching in that market from the Android players. How do you think about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year?
Tim Cook: We don't comment on future products. With respect to 5G, I think most people would tell you, we're in sort of the extremely early innings of it. And even more so on a global basis. So, we couldn't be more proud of what our lineup is and we're excited about the great pipeline of both hardware and software and we wouldn't trade our position for anyone's.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Samik. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

75;AAPL;2019-10-31;"Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us, especially those of you listening in on our new noise-cancelling AirPods Pro which are available beginning today.This was Apple's highest revenue in a September quarter ever, and I want to take you through some of the highlights before we get into greater detail on the conclusion of a remarkable fiscal 2019 for Apple.We achieved revenue of $64 billion in the quarter at the high end of our expectations, even in spite of a predicted foreign exchange drag of almost $1 billion. Geographically, we set new Q4 revenue records in the Americas and rest of Asia-Pacific and saw further improvement in our revenue trends in Greater China.In iPhone, where customers have only begun to get their hands on the strongly popular and unmatched iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, our year-over-year performance continue to improve, more on that in a moment.Outside of iPhone, our September quarter revenue was up 17%. We reached a new all-time high for services with growth accelerating to 18%. We generated well over 50% revenue growth from Wearables, and I am thrilled to say that we set Q4 records for Wearables in each and every market we track. We’ve got a lot to cover, so let's dive right into the details.iPhone revenue in the September quarter was $33 billion. This 9% decline over last year is a significant improvement over the 15% decline we saw across the first three quarters. The significant upswing in demand in the final part of the quarter is mirrored in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, customer feedback and in-store response we've seen for this new generation of devices, not to mention a wave of the best photos you've seen from a smartphone.iPhone 11 features the Apple-designed A13 Bionic the fastest most powerful chip ever in a smartphone plus an all new dual camera system and even longer all day battery life all wrapped in six great new colors. Since its launch, the iPhone 11 has quickly become our best-selling iPhone.iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max deliver even more advanced performance for users who want the very best out of their smartphone. The new Super Retina XDR display is the brightest ever in an iPhone, and the new triple camera system provides a pro level photography experience with an ultra-wide, wide and telephoto camera.All three of our new iPhones feature night mode delivering huge improvements to photo capture in low light environments either indoors or outdoors. They also produce the highest quality video in a smartphone supporting 4K video with extended dynamic range for more highlight detail and cinematic video stabilization.iOS 13 is driving user experience forward across the iPhone family with a bold new look in dark mode, major updates to the apps our customers use every day, such as photos and maps, new ways to help protect their privacy with sign-in with Apple and performance improvements across the entire system.For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion, that's up 18% over last year and it beats the previous record set in the June quarter by more than $1 billion. This isn't a local phenomenon. We saw double-digit services revenue growth and all-time records in all five of our geographic segments, and it wasn't a narrow success either.We established new all-time highs for multiple services categories including the App Store, AppleCare, Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year '16 Services revenue during 2020.I want to touch on a number of services in brief. We had all-time record revenues from payment services. For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with over 3 billion transactions in the September quarter exceeding PayPal's number of transactions and growing four times as fast.Apple Pay is now live in 49 markets around the world with over 6,000 issuers on the platform. We believe that Apple Pay offers the best possible mobile payment experience and the safest, most secure solution on the market.

Users can apply for Apple Card through the wallet app on iPhone in minutes and start using it right away in stores, in apps and on websites.They've told us they love Apple Card's simplicity, privacy, security and transparency, which has helped them make healthier financial choices. Apple Card has absolutely no fees and major apps and retailers like Uber, Uber Eats, Walgreens, Duane Reade, and T-Mobile have already joined to offer 3% daily cash back on Apple Card transactions.And I am very pleased to announce today that later this year, we are adding another great feature to Apple Card. Customers will be able to purchase their new iPhone and pay for it over it over 24 months with zero interest. And they will continue to enjoy all the benefits of Apple Card, including 3% cash back on the total cost of their iPhone with absolutely no fees and the ability to simply manage their payments right in the Apple Wallet app on iPhone. We think these features appeal broadly to all iPhone customers, and we believe this has been the most successful launch of a credit card in United States ever.Last month, we launched Apple Arcade, our groundbreaking game subscription service offering an all new way for the whole family to enjoy games online or offline. Apple Arcade's subscribers get unlimited access to a curated selection of games from many of the most innovative developers in the world with almost 100 new titles playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple TV today and more are being added all the time.

It's the first all original video subscription service, which shows from the best, most ambitious and most creative minds in the industry.One of the great parts of this jobs is that I've gotten to binge-watch almost all of them, and while I won't spoil anything, there is so much to look forward to here for lovers of great storytelling.We premiered shows like See and The Morning Show in LA and New York over the past couple of weeks, and the stage is set for a truly exciting debut. And we're pleased that customers who have purchased qualifying Apple devices starting September 10 can opt into 12 free months of Apple TV+.Turning to Wearables, we had amazing results, thanks to the phenomenal popularity of Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. As I said at the outset, we set Q4 revenue records for Wearables in every single market that we track around the world. In September, we launched Apple Watch Series 5 with the Always-On Retina display, that means you never have to pause a workout or task to raise or tap the display.New location features help users better navigate their day while international emergency calling allows them to call emergency services directly from Apple Watch in over 150 countries even without an iPhone nearby.And combined with the power of watchOS 6, users are empowered to take charge of their health and fitness with new features like Cycle Tracking, the Noise app, Activity Trends. The ECG app now available in 32 markets including India has become a widely celebrated illustration of Apple's commitment to your health giving users the ability to document and monitor the functioning of their heart and provide critical data to their doctors.We're deepening Apple's commitment to medical research. We announced a new Research app paired with three unprecedented medical studies spanning Hearing, Heart and Movement and Women's Health.We are collaborating with leading health institutions to reach more participants than has ever been possible enabling them to contribute to potential medical discoveries and help create the next generation of innovative health products.Leveraging the devices customers use every day and world-class security and privacy, we hope to democratize medical research and bring everyone to the table to make the next big breakthroughs possible.Turning to iPad, we generated 17% growth driven by iPad Pro in the ongoing momentum of our wider line-up. In September, we introduced the seventh-generation iPad bringing more screen area and support for the full-sized Smart Keyboard to our most popular, most affordable iPad.For the first time, we also released iPadOS built on the same foundation as iOS but with powerful apps designed for iPads large multi-touch display, letting users multitask with intuitive gestures and drag and drop of file with the fingertip.For Mac, we generated $7 billion in revenue. We had a tough comparison to last year's fourth quarter when we updated both models of MacBook Pro, but for fiscal 2019 overall, we generated the highest annual revenue ever from our Mac business. In July, we updated our Mac portables with great pricing for students and MacBook Air in particular has been a hit in the back-to-school season.Earlier this month, we released macOS Catalina with all new entertainment apps, the innovative sidecar feature that uses iPad to expand the Mac workspace and new accessibility tools that enable users to control their Mac entirely with their voice. Catalina also brings the Apple Arcade experience to the Mac and we have already seen some amazing third-party developers bring their iPad apps to the Mac App Store with Mac Catalyst including Twitter, Post-it and more.And for our pro customers who push the limits of what Mac can do, we're very excited about the upcoming launch of our newly redesigned Mac Pro this fall, which we are proud to be manufacturing in Austin, Texas.Pulling back the lens from a single quarter, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time.We introduce new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated over $46 billion in total services revenue, setting new yearly services records in all five of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to the size of a Fortune 70 company.We delivered incredible new hardware in all our device categories. Our Wearables business showed explosive growth and generated more annual revenue than two-thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500. And we set a yearly revenue record for Mac. All told, outside of iPhone, our revenue grew by $17 billion to almost a $118 billion.Our overall success was achieved widely across our markets with annual revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. And as we head into the holiday season, we have an enormous amount to look forward to. We believe that we lead in innovation because we lead with our values.At the time of urgency and action on climate change, we continue to drive breakthroughs in clean power sustainable materials and device recycling. By running a 100% of our global operations on renewable energy and challenging our entire network of suppliers do the same, we are driving a virtuous cycle of demand for clean sources of power. And we see the award Apple recently received from the United Nation's Global Climate Action program as a mandate to deepen this vital work.We continue to invent and improve on cutting edge renewable materials, including the 100% recycled aluminum alloy found in many of our products, and we've added rare earth elements to our list of recycled materials with the introduction of iPhone 11. We're disassembling, recycling or refurbishing millions of devices every year with the help of Daisy, our recycling robot, and we're pushing the entire global supply chain toward recycled or renewable materials.We're driving access to critical coding skills development to educators and students through programs such as our teaching coding academies and our free everyone can code curriculum. We continue to put user privacy at the center of everything that we do and we know that Apple is strongest when our commitment to diversity and inclusion brings all voices to the table.I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and our employees for making fiscal 2019 such a success, and I look forward to another great year in 2020.Now for more details on our September quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record as we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%.Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio.On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and rest of Asia-Pacific segments. We also saw continuous improvement in Greater China where year-over-year revenue comparisons became more favorable each quarter of fiscal 2019 from a 27% decline in the first quarter to a 2% decline in the fourth quarter.At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed and emerging markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue. Products gross margin was 31.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially due to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.1% even with the June quarter.Net income was $13.7 billion. Diluted EPS was a Q4 record at $3.03 and up 4% year-over-year, and operating cash flow of $19.9 billion was also a Q4 record, up almost $400 million from the previous record we set last year.Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $33.4 billion a year-over-year decline of 9%. This was a meaningful improvement to the 12% decline in the third quarter and a 16% decline in the first half of the fiscal year. And we saw great customer response to the launch of iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro max at the end of the quarter.Our active installed base of iPhone continues to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments. And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter 83% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to Services, we had a very strong quarter with all-time record performance and growth accelerating from the June quarter. All five geographic segments set new all-time Services revenue records and all grew double-digits.We also established new all-time records for the App Store, Apple Care, Music, Cloud Services, Payment Services and our App Store search ad business. In total, services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% of our gross margin mix.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with double-digit growth in paid accounts in all our geographic segments.We now have 450 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform compared to over 330 million just a year ago, and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.Absolute revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year.There are now more than 35,000 subscription apps on our platform, with the largest accounting for less than 0.25% of total services revenue. Among our many all-time services records, it was the best quarter ever for AppleCare. Thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution.And to better meet our customers' needs, we announced a new iPhone repair program making it easier for independent providers across the U.S. to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network and offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.The new program complements our continued investment in our growing global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers the lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products.Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air line-up and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models.Despite the tough compare, we generated an all-time revenue record for Mac in the US and in India and a fourth quarter revenue record in Japan. More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a year ago. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments with a Q4 revenue record in Japan. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 97% from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter more than 80% plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the third quarter across all five geographic segments.The performance was driven by tremendous growth across Apple Watch, AirPods, BIS products and accessories. And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 records for our Wearables category in every single market we track around the world.Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories. We also continue to see great results from our trade-in program with more than five times the iPhone trade-in volume we had a year ago.Last month, we reopened the standing Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York with an even more welcoming layout beneath the landmark glass cube providing nearly twice the space of the original store.This iconic store is opened seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and provides an even better environment for customers to experience our latest products, meet with our geniuses, created pros and specialists, and attend our free daily Today at Apple sessions.We also opened our newest and largest store in Japan, and fifth store in Tokyo, in the Marunouchi business district across from the historic Tokyo Station, and we opened a beautiful new store in the heart of Mexico City's vibrant Polanco district to welcome visitors to experience the best of Apple in Mexico.We are seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, with growth significantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great momentum transforming major industries.One example is retail. 80 of the 100 largest retailers in the world are choosing Apple to modernize their customers and employee experiences across all functions of their business.Retailers are using iPhone, iPad and Mac to optimize their back of house operations, modernize point of sale, and deliver differentiated customer and employee experiences.Customer engagement and assisted selling have been areas of particular focus and we're seeing great results for iconic brands such as Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Sephora USA, Gap Inc., and many others.We’re also having been government agencies around the world, use technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the way they deliver critical services to the public. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau is making fundamental changes to the design and implementation of next year's census with a goal of producing quality results, while reducing costs by leveraging the mobility user experience and privacy of iOS.Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices will be deployed this fiscal year to support an innovative new model for the collection and management of Census data and we are proud that our products will play an important role in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and security of this data.CDW Apple's partner in this initiative will also utilize Apple Financial Services, our enterprise financing platform to help minimize the cost to the public by taking advantage of the uniquely strong residual value of Apple devices.Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $260 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $7 billion of new term debt, retired $3 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $4 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $98 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including almost $18 billion through open market repurchases of 86 million Apple shares and $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. We also retired an additional 7 million shares in the final settlement of our 14th ASR.As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $1 billion.We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on November 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2019.Before we open the call to questions, I also have a special announcement to make today. Nancy Paxton, our Head of Investor Relations for the last 23 years has decided to retire at the end of December after a wonderful 33 year career at Apple and 93 earnings calls. Nancy has been the face of Apple with analysts and investors over a period of incredible growth and success.Her passion for our company, her commitment and dedication to serve our entire investor base and her sense of humor will be missed greatly. Personally, I'm very grateful for the advice and support you have given me during this last six years. We all wish you the very best for the next and exciting phase of your life.With that, let us open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you very much for the kind remarks, Luca. It's obviously been a great privilege for me to engage with so many investors and analysts on behalf of Apple over the last couple of decades, and of course it's been an extreme pleasure to work alongside with some of the brilliant people here at Apple on a day to day basis. But let's get to the business at hand for the 93rd time, and open the call to questions. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.
Operator: Certainly, today that will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declined 9%. So can you talk about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth? And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?
Tim Cook: Katy, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It's early but the trends look very good. So I don't want to make a long-range forecast here. We've put our current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are bullish.
Katy Huberty: Great. And Luca on margins guidance is consistent with September, but there is a lot going on under the covers; tariffs could expand in mid-December; there is some impact from the TV+ bundle; you have some big currency in commodity price move. So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?
Luca Maestri: Yes. Katy, of course. As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially. On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we've got right now is going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis.Also keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters, and that obviously is dilutive to the company -- to the company margin.On a year-over-year basis, we are also about flat. And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question will be from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.
Mike Olson: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So Wearables category has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives in healthcare, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth and maybe conversely how important is a rising installed base of Wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple health? And then I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Michael, it's Tim. The Wearables have done extremely well. It was acceleration further from the previous quarter. So we're thrilled with the results as to what's driving it it's the totality that's driving it. For some people it's about fitness; for some people, it's about health; for some other people, it's about communication; and for some people, it's all of the above. And I think the new feature of Always-On on Series 5 is a game changer for many of our users.And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor.We've got the research going that I had mentioned earlier, there will be more of those through time, and obviously we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet that we're working on. But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back, and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health.
Mike Olson: Okay. Thanks. And then with the strong slate of content in Apple TV+, can you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are buying in applicable device versus charging for it? And my congrats to Nancy. And thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, it's a gift to our users, and from a business point of view, we'd like to -- we're really proud of the content. We'd like as many people as possible to view it. And so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. And so we are - we feel great about doing that.I think it's a bold move. And the price also for those people that are not buying a device in the period of time that we offer this, the price is very aggressive as well. You think - think about the quality of content that you get for 499, and it's amazing. It is amazing.
Nancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question please?
Operator: That will come from Evercore’s Amit Daryanani.
Amit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks a lot guys. I guess two questions from me as well. First one, Tim, if you think about the Services business, less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. But I am wondering if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high-teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the installed base. And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward?
Tim Cook: I think, we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the installed base as Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter and we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets.And so the installed base is clearly a piece of it getting the trade-in program going, and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. And, of course, ultimately the thing that builds the installed base is to make customers happy, and that's our -- always our top objective is to have satisfied customers.The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the ARPU is increasing. And so, as there is more offers out there, I mean the one that is today getting the attention is on the streaming side.But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, it's significant and people love them. And so it's really both of those. And obviously in - finally in getting more people that are enjoying things for free to - let to pay for some of the premium services. So it's sort of all three of those.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And if I was just kind of go back to the variables discussion, especially as I think about Apple Watch and AirPods, is there a central way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch and AirPod update.I just want to understand if I think about 900 million plus iPhone installed base, what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how long could this one maybe as you go forward?
Tim Cook: We’re not releasing the precise numbers of our Wearables, but it is a really nice try and get me to say that. The -- what we're seeing in terms of new adds on the Watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments is about three-quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch.And so we are still insignificantly in the build mode there, and so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near sort of a mature penetration. We got lot left there, and the AirPods just keep hitting new highs.And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too and we are really proud to add another product out there for people wanting noise-cancelling with the AirPod Pro beginning to sell today.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: That will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. First, Nancy, just want to send you our best wishes. We will definitely miss you. I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very instrumental over the years.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you.
Shannon Cross: My questions though with regard to China, and I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone, any thoughts on - you know, Hong Kong used to be a big market, there is obviously some turmoil there. So if you could provide some more in China that would be helpful? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there. As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus two last quarter.And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew one. And so there is a very slight growth there. We obviously want that to be better. But we feel good about how we're doing.I think it's a combination of things that are - that have turned things around. On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press.Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there. Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have had moved the dial. And so it's sort of the sum of all of that.I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double digit. We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I should say some key gaming approvals.It's not all about quantity, but about which ones, we saw that. Also Wearables, Wearables are doing so great at a company level. They're doing even better in China. And so lots of positives there.
Shannon Cross: Thank you. And then, I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can talk a bit about how you think about operating expense growth. It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. So I am just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend? And then, is there a point at which we might just see some leverage? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Well, you know, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles. In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. In other cases, like fiscal '19, it was the other way around. But our approach frankly is not changing over time. We want to invest in the business.Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience differentiate our products.We continue to run SG&A tightly. Obviously, if you look at what we had launched in the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we are launching a lot of new services.And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we’re launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: That will come from Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I think this is for Luca, and then I have a follow-up as well. If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more, and even last year given that iPhone is a slower growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially.So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new services, I guess the question is, why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line?And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism given that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? Or are there other forces at work that we should be considered?
Luca Maestri: Toni, thanks for the question. The guidance that we are providing if you look at it at the midpoint implies an acceleration of growth from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal 2019.As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. This is about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. So that is something to keep in mind.We feel very good as Tim said about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started, and we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. Wearables has very, very strong momentum. The portfolio of services also has incredible momentum.One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro, a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year.So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you for that. And then if I could follow-up, just on the bundling of Apple TV+, I guess for you, Tim, this is really the first time we've seen a significant bundling of services offering and hardware offering.And I'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of Apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings - bundled offerings, and ultimately do you - do you ever believe that your hardware itself might be offered as a bundled service.And maybe while we're on that either you or Luca could give us the 30 second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting? Approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be deferring, and what's your expectation for attach rate on that? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Let me cover the accounting issue first. Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right. And we don't want to get into the details of that because we do those assumptions as confidential and competitively sensitive.But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file.So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change over time as we get more information on how the customers behave. We haven't launched the service yet - we're going to serve - serving our customers tomorrow. So we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.
Tim Cook: On the bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users, and so that's what we're doing.You can also see that on the other services we're not doing that. And so it's not part of a broader pattern, or although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time.In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they are on upgrade plans and so forth. And so to some degree that exists today, my perspective is that we will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately.And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things. That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: That will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. And Nancy, congratulations to you too, and we're going to miss you.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you.
Chris Caso: My first question is about pricing and the effect of some of the lower price points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year. And it looked like margins and revenues did well on that, and also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year, and obviously we've seen some improvement in China as well.So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible approach to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect?
Luca Maestri: Yes, Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well received and do show a level of elasticity, but the most important thing by far is the product. And I think we've got the best line-up we've ever had in the customer response to the product and what the product does for them is really incredible.And photos I am getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. And so I think it's product first, and then prices sort of falls out of that, and we did decide to be more aggressive. And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call.In terms of emerging markets we picked sort of locally relevant prices, and in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would have reflected a while back, instead of the current exchange rate.And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.
Chris Caso: Thank you. As a follow-on, perhaps you could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming what -- do you have a view of what potential impact that could have going forward and how Apple is looking to address it? Will you need to adjust your own pricing if in fact the tariffs are imposed?
Tim Cook: We are paying some tariffs today as you know, some that went into effect pre-September, and some others that went into effect in September. So we are paying some that's been comprehended. But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going, and that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well.And just the tone I think has changed significantly and I have long thought that it was in both countries, best interests to get to an agreement that may be initially doesn't solve everything but solves some things that each party may want and get to a better place than where we're at and I'm hopeful that that's where we're headed.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question please?
Operator: That will be from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with one of the new services Apple Arcade, and if you have any insights in terms of what you're seeing for engagement or retention of customers beyond the initial trial period also how your partnerships with developers progressing there. How does the pipeline look like than any early projections of what that business longer term might look like?
Tim Cook: We're not going to give out projections on it, but I would tell you that we were really pleased with the number of people that enter the trial period. People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or week or so. And so it's really too early to tell what the conversion rate will be.But I feel like we're off to a good start and the - most important of everything. The customer feedback to date has really been incredible and we're very excited for the future of the service.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. As a follow-up if I can, trying to attack the Wearables question within the angle, what are you seeing in terms of -- I believe consumer behavior in upgrading Wearables like Apple Watch AirPods and how are you thinking about your ability to accelerate some of that replacement cycle by driving innovation?
Tim Cook: I think we, because the Watch is relatively young. We haven't seen enough upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet. And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And so there is still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard.I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to -- how often and so forth. On the AirPods we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro.But I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that have AirPods today and want to have -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation.
Nancy Paxton: Thank you. Samik. A replay of today’s call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

76;AAPL;2020-01-29;"Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speaks as of their respective dates.I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us.We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $91.8 billion, which is above the high-end of our guidance range, with revenue growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. Geographically, we set all-time records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Specific and saw Greater China return to growth.Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone including a new all-time record for services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone, reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in services. Let’s take each category one by one.On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion, again that’s up 8% over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top-selling model every week during the December quarter and the three new models were our three most popular iPhones.We had double-digit growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., the UK, France and Singapore, and also grew double digits in emerging markets led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand, and Turkey. These new models are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped with advance technologies and unprecedented leap in battery life to easily get through the day and our best-in-class camera experience. We have been wild with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night Mode photo challenge this month.Turning to services. Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all-time record, growing 17% over last year. Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records from multiple categories including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and AppleCare.2019 was a historic year for our services business, and I’d like to touch on some highlights. For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customers spending a new single day record $386 million on New Year's Day alone, a 20% increase over last year. Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won’t find anywhere else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month.Apple TV+ is off to a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire team at The Morning Show for their multiple Golden Globes nomination. Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild award and Billy Crudup on his Critics Choice award.We continue to focus on telling stories that matter, like Little America, which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great content still to come. Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., UK, Australia and Canada, and provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories. Apple News+ continues to add new titles, offering subscribers seamless access to the world’s top publications across all of their devices.For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with the run rate exceeding 15 billion transactions a year. Apple Pay transit support expanded with customers paying for journeys on transport for London more easily with Apple Pay Express Transit. And in spring of 2020, iPhone and Apple Watch customers will be able to simply tap to ride trains and buses in even more cities including Shenzhen and Guangzhou.We are thrilled with the continued growth at Apple Card. And last month, the customers began using Apple Card monthly installments at Apple retail and online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24 months. We see great promise for these recently launched services, and we're optimistic about what we've got in the pipeline for each of them.Now, turning to Wearables. We had another incredible quarter, setting an all-time record in virtually every market we track around the world, and this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company. Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our recently launched AirPods Pro, our new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise cancellation.Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact on our customers’ lives and it continues to further its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch. Both AirPods and Apple Watch were must have holiday gifts, helping drive unprecedented results for the category, even as we face supply constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro.Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively, and the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments.For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India, Turkey, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, with our current line-up of iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPad, along with the new iPadOS will give the customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, as well as Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put into hands of Pros. And we’ve already seen a strong response from the Pro community from developers, photographers and music producers to filmmakers and scientists who rely on the Mac to create their life’s best work.We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy winning and nominated artists this past weekend who rely on Logic Pro 10 and the Mac to create incredible music we all love.I want to call out and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online teams. This quarter, we opened a beautiful new store in Kawasaki, Japan. And exciting things are taking place inside each and every store. Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone. We see a very bright future for these efforts and we continue to innovate to ensure that everyone who visits an Apple retail location has a great experience.We began 2020 with our greatest product line-up ever and we are only deepening our commitment to do our part to make the world a better place. In November, we released a completely redesigned Everyone Can Code curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to the world of coding. The new curriculum includes even more resources for teachers, a brand new guide for students and updates Swift Coding Club materials. Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving.November also saw the launch of our new research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user. Customers in the U.S. can enroll in three landmark multiyear health studies that we’re undertaking with leading academic and research institutions. The Apple Women's Health Study, the Apple Heart And Movement Study and the Hearing Study, as in everything we do, we build user privacy into the research app from the ground up.This quarter we also announced a $2.5 billion plan to help address the housing availability and affording crisis in our home state of California. We feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always called home stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live and raise a family, including those who do so much to serve the community, like firefighters and teachers.In much more recent news, we’re closely following the development of the coronavirus. We're donating two groups that are working to contain the outbreak, we're working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region.As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well underway on some new and exciting developments for the future. Apple’s strength will always be its boundless creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different. But for now, for more details on the results, I would like to turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 billion or 9% from a year ago, in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange. Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth, and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record, $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in every geographic segment and new all-time records across our portfolio.Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue, despite of a negative 60 basis-point impact from foreign exchange.Products gross margin was 34.2%, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable one-time item impacted the rate by 230 basis points.Net income was an all-time record of $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19% and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago.Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $56 billion grew 8% year-over-year, as we saw a great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the U.S. Mexico, the UK, France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to services. We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year ‘16 services revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run-rate basis with the results of the December quarter.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both, transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago. And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we're experiencing across our services offerings, we're increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year.Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all-time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very-strong double digits while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution, many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the very-best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers, and we are very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users.Next, I’d like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion and iPad revenue was $6 billion. Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air here, Mac mini and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channels fill. Despite the tough compare, on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year.Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter, were new to that product. And the active installed base of both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 92% from businesses, and among both consumers and businesses were planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter 78% plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, home and accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across Wearables, accessories and home. We set all-time records for Wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experience some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter.We also continued to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work. 100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows, and we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses Core ML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during child birth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both, clinical outcomes and costs.Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company, which makes handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions in the market today.Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued a 2 billion euro-denominated green bond, retired $1 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter and we maintained our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion, through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we would share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter.Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63 billion and $67 billion. The wider than usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on February 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020.With that, let's open the call to questions.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may have the first question, please?
Operator: Yes. That will be from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first one for me on Wearables, fairly impressive to see, it’s already a $10 billion business for you guys. Could you just touch on the growth that you are seeing on the Wearables side? How much the growth you think is coming from first time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have, because it looks to us the adoption rate is fairly low in your installed base, so there should be a long run way, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those two buckets.
Tim Cook: Yes. Amit, it’s Tim. If you look at the Apple, the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%. So, it was very strong, as you say. Both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch. And so, it’s still very much a selling to new customers at this point.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. And I guess, Luca, you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide I think implies gross margin of flat to actually up 10, 15 basis point. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March I think because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So, what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better than seasonal guide for gross margins?
Luca Maestri: Yes. That's right, Amit. It’s about flat sequentially, and by the way significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. But on a sequential basis, you are right, on one side we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality but we expect that that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Tom Forte with D.A Davidson.
Tom Forte: So, congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally, how you're getting success, is it truly on critical acclaim, is it on number of consumers that are using the service, contribution and service revenue, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Hey, Tom, it’s Tim. We are primarily measuring our sales on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that we have our bundle where if you buy pretty much any device, you’re getting a year for free. And so, we're very focused on subscribers. That said, the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we will find that there will be some number of those that will also be critical acclaimed. And we're seeing that with the morning show, we're seeing that with Little America and others.
Tom Forte: Great. And then, my second question is I think you indicated that last month we started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how that’s had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?
Tim Cook: So, retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was the -- getting to a monthly payments on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course, that’s U.S. only at this point, but the U.S. is very key market for us. And so, it was an important part of it.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Tom. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to revisit China. Tim, can you talk about what you are seeing in the region -- what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis? And then, can you also update us a bit in terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual-sourcing, geographic diversification, even with the region, just so we have some idea of how this will be managed? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes. Thanks,, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter, and then I will get into the coronavirus in a second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China. So, that was an important change from where we've been running. We also had double-digit growth in services in Mainland China and we had extremely strong double-digit on Wearables. And so, really, there were a number of different factors in terms of the things that customers are responding to. iPhone 11 is doing well there, the product has been very well-received with its battery life and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trading programs going and financing programs. These have also been well received.And so, it’s sort of the sum of all of this. And we are tracking quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. Three quarters of the customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly two-thirds of the customers buying iPad are new. So, it was a terrific quarter. We had three of the top four selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar.In terms of the coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I've mentioned, we’re donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We are also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider than usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty.I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, they’re our ultimate sources, and we’re obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We've factored best thinking and the guidance that we've provided you.With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10th, depending upon the supplier location, and we've attempted to account for this delayed start up through our larger range of outcomes that Luca mentioned earlier.With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed one of our retail stores and a number of channel partners have also closed their store fronts. Many of the stores that remain opened have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep-cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area, across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that we’ve provided you. I hope that gets you some color.
Shannon Cross: Yes. That was very helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on from a gross margin from perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability. Obviously, there has been some movement on DRAM and NAND. So, if you can talk about how you are thinking about inventory levels and managing that going forward? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes. As I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always, and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move and at times when we feel it’s appropriate we buy certain commodities in advance. And so, we will continue that practice as we go through the year.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Luca, can you address the modest slowdown in services growth this quarter, 17% versus 18% in September? Which services categories accelerated versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth?
Luca Maestri: Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. The 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year ‘19 growth rate, which was 16%. So, we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was very broad-based growth because we grew double digits in services across all the five geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and the AppleCare. If you remember, we had set two goals for ourselves in the services segment. The first, we set a goal to double our fiscal ‘16 revenue during 2020. And when we look at it on a run rate basis, we’ve already achieved that goal with the results of the December quarter.We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And given that we are already at 480 at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. So, now, we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so, we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. So, we feel that the services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently. For example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so, while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time they start contributing to the growth of the services business. But, we feel very happy with the 17%.
Katy Huberty: Thank you for that. Tim, as a follow-up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone. How big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective?
Tim Cook: Sorry. We don’t comment on future products. And so, I will try to sidestep a bit. With respect to 5G, I think it’s -- we're in the early innings of its deployment on a global basis. We obviously couldn’t be prouder of our lineup and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn’t trade our position for anybody.
Tejas Gala: Thanks, Katie. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: We’ll hear from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.
Kyle McNealy: So, we were seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and it’s already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity? Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivize to upgrade handsets to get a leverage out of these new network investments? How much might this be helping, and do you think it will continue to accelerate?
Tim Cook: I think that we’ve had some great partners, not only in the U.S. but also around the world that are really helpful this quarter, as partners. And so, I think that probably a part of that is the level of investments they have. And then, a part of it is probably making sure that those customer stick with them in a environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So, I am optimistic that it will continue.
Kyle McNealy: Okay, great. And then, the comment that you made about capacity in the Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we think about the timeline of when those capacity constraints might be alleviated? And will they come from capacity additions or the natural workout of unit shipments and something on the demand side?
Tim Cook: I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come in to balance during this quarter. On AirPods Pro, I don't have estimate for that for you. I just can't predict when at this point. We seem to be fairly substantially off their and we're working very hard to put in additional capacity.
Tejas Gala: Thanks, Kyle. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Yes. Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi. Thank you. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market, as you build out TV+, given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy?
Tim Cook: I think, it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that doesn’t encroach on people's privacy. I wouldn’t want to conjecture about us in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel strongly that what the customer wants is an add-free product, and so that's not our aversion to ads, it’s what we believe that a customer wants.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you. And Luca, can you just clarify if the services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content costs associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes. So, yes. Of course, we launched the service and so there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral, and there was also contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue, at this point, there are two components. There is paid subscribers, these are the customers that pay for the service and we recognize revenue over the subscription period. And then, we got the what we call the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers. These are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a three-year of TV+ services. We deferred revenue for this offer, based on three items, the first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the one year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer. And the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will redeem the offer. So, you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability.Also, the take rate can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So, this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. So, these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we deferred for each device sale that then gets recognized over the one-year period that the TV plus service has provided. So, when you take the combination of paid subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of course because we’ve launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter, was immaterial to our results.With regard to the cost of developing the content, we -- essentially as we incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.
Tejas Gala: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: We’ll hear from Cowen and Company's Krish Sankar.
Krish Sankar: I had two questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There is a general view that when 5G phones come out they’re going to be more expensive due to higher component costs, but at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low cost geographies to phones like iPhone SE. So, how do you see these two different segments within the smart phone market evolving over the next one to three years? And then, I had a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook: Again, I’m going to stay away from commenting about future products. But, generally, I think it’s important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seen here. And so, that’s very important. In terms of the price, I wouldn’t want to comment on the price of handsets that aren’t announced.
Krish Sankar: And then, a follow-up for Luca. OpEx as a percentage of sales for March looks like e about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious how much of that is -- part of it is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the OpEx or how do we think about it on a go forward basis?
Luca Maestri: Yes. I think we felt good about our OpEx results, because they were at the low end of our guidance range. But clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business. And in terms of the new services, not only for TV+ but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is period where we’re making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing, and that level of investment is reflected in our OpEx results. And also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business unit in December quarter. And so, we had -- we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business, partially during the quarter, after the completion of the transaction. And that is a very important core technology for the Company. So, we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter, and it’s a fact that our revenue was very strong, and we have certain valuable expenses. For example, credit card fees that are associated with the higher volume and of course impacted our OpEx results.
Tejas Gala: Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will be from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler.
Mike Olson: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, slightly different take on an earlier question on Wearables, and that is, what impact you think Wearables is driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75% watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but are many of them new to Apple overall? I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPads or Mac users are going to Wearables customers, but do you think Wearables bring people into the ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way?
Tim Cook: I think that -- Mike, it’s Tim. With each Apple product that a customer buys, I think, they get tighter into the ecosystem because they like -- that's the reason that they're buying into it, is they like the experience, the customer experience. And so from that point of view, I think each of our products can drive another product. I would think, in that case it’s more likely that the iPhone comes first, but there's no doubt in my mind that there's some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch.
Mike Olson: Okay. And then, I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives most significantly. For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category? In other words, where will the average person kind of first feel that impact of AR on their lives in a significant way? Thanks.
Tim Cook: I think, when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I'm so excited about it is, you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both see it as key to them. And so, I think, the answer is --- that's the reason, I think it’s going to pervade your lives is because it’s going to go across business and your home life. I think, these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise. And of course you can see -- you go on to store, see thousands of apps that are AR kit enabled at this time and would even more coming.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Raymond James, Chris Caso.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, the first question is on gross margins. And you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. And clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall mix that growing year-on-year. But, if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iPhone, is that improving as well and also helping margins? And is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix in margins?
Luca Maestri: Yes. And I think that the mix helped us both in Q1 and its helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones. The customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max is being exceptional. And that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so certainly, better mix within iPhone. The other point that I would like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given that fact that services are accretive to gross margin for the Company, we end up getting a better mix from services as well.
Chris Caso: Okay. Thank you. And I guess, follow-on question with regard to OpEx. And it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for I guess largely over the last three years or so. Can you set us some expectation with regard to when you get a return on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But, how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the OpEx spending tend to level off and you get some return on that or is it just the function of a faster revenue growth in future?
Luca Maestri: Well, I would start by saying that our expense to revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our OpEx grows faster than our revenue but we also had years in the recent past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, and not only marketing and advertising but also in R&D.As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it’s a very important strategic core technology for the Company going forward. And I think from the results that you’ve seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided for the March quarter, I think we’re doing a pretty good job of balancing the level of investments that we’re making on the expense front, with the level of returns that we get both in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that we’re getting. Our net income for example was up 11% during the December quarter.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
Samik Chatterjee: I just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth, definitely good to see return to growth. Based on the velocity and momentum you’re seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through year? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: We have a practice of forecasting the current quarter. And so, we’ve given you the range that we expect for the current quarter and really don't give a range beyond that.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. So, if I can just maybe then follow up in terms of -- obviously, you’ve returned to growth in most of the regions you report. One of the regions that are declining is Japan. So, if you can share your thoughts on what actions you need to take there to return that segment and that geography to grow? And what are the product trends there and what's probably the headwind that's kind of limiting growth there?
Luca Maestri: Yes. So, Japan was down 10% during the December quarter. It was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October where essentially the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the two-year contract and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say, within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter, six of the top seven selling smart models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So, it was very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. Also, in Japan, we had very strong double-digit growth from services, stronger than Company average; and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than Company average. So, we feel very good. Japan is a country where historically we’ve had great success. The customers are very loyal and well engaged. And based on position there, we feel we have a very good momentum.

77;AAPL;2020-05-01;"Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tejas Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.Speaking first today is Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we’ll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you’ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business and results of operations.Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple’s most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speaks as of their respective dates.I’d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I hope you’re staying safe and well.Today Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all-time record for Services, and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a quarterly revenue record for Apple Retail powered by phenomenal growth in our online store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which we’ve ever operated our business, we’re proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter.But before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19. This is something Apple has been contending with since January. And I think that how we have responded, what we have been inspired to do, tells an important story about Apple’s great durability as a business, and the enduring importance of our products in our customers’ lives. It also speaks to Apple’s unmatched capacity to be creative, to think always in terms of the long term and to forge ahead when others may feel an instinct to pull back.Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business in introducing powerful new products, and in meeting our customers’ needs, but they also rose to the occasion in terms of meeting our broader obligations to the communities in which we live and work.Let’s look quickly across the business. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers’ hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the Company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they’re donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world.While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines.In a quarter where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute, and which speaks to the real durability of our Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. As Apple News, reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated trusted information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical.We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV and services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.In software, at the same time that our teams worked with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first ever all online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with the CDC. As of today, the app has been installed nearly 2 million times and the web tool has received over 3 million unique visits. And just this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are launching a joint effort with Google to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the virus with user privacy and security central to the design.We paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to get back where it’s needed most. We’ve made major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support global citizens as well as a new fund for Americans experiencing food insecurity as a result of the crisis. When you tally these things up and consider our ongoing 2 to 1 match for employee donations, Apple’s contributions to the global response are significant, diverse, and a great source of pride for the whole chain.We’re also doing what we can to help our employees, their families, and by extension their communities stay safe and well by modifying our operations where appropriate. This extends of course to our retail employees, they are Apple’s face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business and we’re compensating them normally despite store closures.During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.At this time of social distance, of shuttered school and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for customers. Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to teach, learn, and stay connected with each other. We are in the process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada; Glasgow, Scotland and Puerto Rico, a 100,000 to the city of Los Angeles and 350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deployment ever.Since early March, we’ve seen unprecedented demand for a pro app from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us all entertained and inspired as we stay at home. And to help them do it, we made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90-days for everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure. Many hospitals such as Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health, and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.Now, when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic, but I don't think I can recall a quarter where I've been prouder of what we do or how we do it.As I said at the outset, we achieved revenue of $58.3 billion and underneath that was product revenue of $45 billion. The performance of our product business had three very different phases during the March quarter. Based on Apple’s performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations. In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong and in line with our expectations. During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13th, and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.Given the lack of visibility and uncertainly in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. Over the long term though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business. Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross-section of customers, including the all-new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value.Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically having to figure out how to do just about everything in a brand new way.Our long-running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring large and growing installed base. We expect to meet our longstanding goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue in 2020. We have always run Apple for the long term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strain, a robust cash position and our best product pipeline ever.Major investments, including our five-year commitment to contribute $350 billion to the economy here in the United States are moving forward full speed ahead. It’s in these moments that we set ourselves apart. We’ve always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation. And that’s our strategy today.And so, while we can’t say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing, and connecting so that life can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.With that, I’ll hand things off to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January. But, we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.So, the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of a 100 basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue was $45 billion, down 3%.After a very strong January, our performance was impacted particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increase due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago. Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%. We set a new all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we track. I’ll provide more details on this later.Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings and mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than under normal circumstances due to the COVID-19 impact I mentioned earlier.Services gross margin was 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4%. This was lower than our 16.5% guidance due to onetime discreet items.Net income was $11.2 billion and earnings per share with $2.55, up 4%. Operating cash flow was very strong at $13.3 billion, an improvement of $2.2 billion over a year ago.Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.iPhone revenue of $29 billion, declined 7% year-over-year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter.On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages during February, but we’ve been extremely pleased with the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain, as well as its ability to get people back to work safely when circumstances allow. Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines.On the demand side, after very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks, and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter, when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point-of-sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high. This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.Turning to Services. We set an all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with strong performance across the board with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, Video, cloud services, and our App Store search ad business. And we also set a March quarter record for AppleCare. Our new services, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus and Apple Card continue to add users, content and features while contributing to overall Services growth.As Tim mentioned, we’re well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal ‘16 Services revenue during 2020.App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high. Our first party subscription services also continued to perform very well. Apple Music and cloud services, both set all-time revenue record and AppleCare set a March quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all three of these services were up strong double-digits.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter. In particular, the number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago. On a sequential basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest sequential growth we have ever experienced. With this momentum, we’re confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year with strong double digit performance across all five geographic segments.Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we’re very excited by the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. For example, Apple Watch continues to expand its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter were new to the product.Next, I’d like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $5.4 billion; iPad revenue was $4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand new iPad Pro that includes a first in class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications; and MacBook Air with significantly improved performance at a lower price. We’re very pleased with the strong customer interest for both products.Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac.In the enterprise market businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely. We’ve created content to assist our customers in this transition including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPad and Mac and security. We’ve also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees such as IBM and SAP have been able to pivot quickly to allow employees to easily set up and secure their devices from home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager and zero-touch deployment.And we’ve seen countless examples of new projects of remote deployments implemented in just a few hours. Peloton for instance, worked with our New York teams to deploy an entire fleet of Macs overnight, so their team could work remotely.In essential sectors, such as grocery and financial services, we’ve seen organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely. Leading grocers around the world, like Trader Joe’s, Woolworths, Lawson’s, Sainsbury’s, Lidl, and Carrefour offer Apple Pay so customers can use contactless payments. And as stores shift to become fulfillment centers for online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and food delivery to reduce foot traffic.In banking, where safety and securities are a top priority, one way to protect company and client information is by providing corporate iOS devices to employees who use mobile phones daily as part of their jobs. As an example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS devices for their workforce.Let me now turn to our cash position.First, I want to note that liquidity has not been an issue for us during these highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets, and unmatched free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, total debt of $110 billion. And as a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares, and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I’d like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in April, and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we’re facing.From a foreign exchange standpoint, the U.S. dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world. And as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our global supply chain is back, up and running. We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched. These newly launched products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer response, even during these extreme circumstances.On iPhone and Wearables, we expect a year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter; on iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter.On Services, we are seeing two distinct trends. First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, Video, Music, and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity, due to the lockdowns around the world, services like AppleCare and advertising are being impacted. AppleCare is comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures and reduced level of customer traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads, and Apple News ads has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products, and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Foreign exchange will have a 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 basis points impact year-over-year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the commentary we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost savings and the mix shift towards services.With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our shareholders. We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the U.S. economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a five-year period.We also continue to believe that there is great value in our stock, and we are maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized $50 billion for share repurchases in addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan. Our Board has also authorized a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock, payable on May 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2020.Finally, and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term, as we’ve always done. During uncertain times historically, we have continued to invest in the business and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely, and taking care of our teams and believe we will come out from this stronger.With that, let’s open the call to questions.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may have the first question, please?
Operator: Yes. That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question, and I hope everyone is well. Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So, I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment, a geographic basis, what you’re seeing and in the various regions that you’re selling in and what you’re hearing from your customers. And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Sure, Shannon. If you look at -- I’ll start with China. If you look at what happened in China, we were having a really good January. The lockdown started there toward the end of January, as you know. February, we saw a steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown completed in mid-February, toward the second half of February, we begin to open stores. We opened on a staggered basis that took about 30 days until mid-March. And from a demand point of view, we saw then an improvement in March over February. And if you look at, kind of where we are today, we’ve seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so, that’s China.If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first five weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call. The next five weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about. The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March when the shelter-in-place orders went in and the work-from-home began. For those two, three weeks period, at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand.If you now step out into April and look at that, early April started like the end of March, but in the second half of April, we’ve seen an uptick across really across the board. It’s not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more. In particular for as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter, and that’s customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. So, complex answer to your question, but that’s what we’re seeing.
Shannon Cross: Thank you. That was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter, but didn’t really discuss operating expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. I’m curious how you’re thinking about your spending and OpEx, given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes. So, Shannon, as we said, we manage the Company for the long term, right? So, we know that the core of the business, the core of the Company is innovation and product and services development. So, we will continue to invest in our pipeline. We’re very excited about what we have in store. And so, we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are aware of the environment and so, we will manage the SG&A portion of the company tightly. We are making new investments in the new services that we launched recently. As you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel. And obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it’s a core technology for us. And so, we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will be from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that we’re all very appreciative of Apple’s contribution during this pandemic. We all appreciate it.
Tim Cook: Thank you very much for that.
Wamsi Mohan: Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing. And you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development, during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Well, we’re continuing to operate. And so, as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, and the MacBook Air. And so, the business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. And so, we’re continuing to work. Everybody’s getting used to the work-at-home. In some areas of the Company, people maybe even more productive, in some other areas they’re not as productive. And so, it’s mixed, depending upon what the roles are. But, as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we’ve got. They’re even more important in these times.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you, Tim. As a follow-up, I know you’re doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. But, I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently, structure maybe deferred payments or things like that, or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. We’re working on doing that for other products as well. And you’ll see something on that shortly. So, we’re very-focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down. In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. But, as you know, having access to the card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom. And that is not using our balance sheet. But, we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the card.
Tejas Gala: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty.
Katy Huberty: Thank you for the question. I hope the whole team is staying healthy and safe. Tim, I want to start on a longer term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And I’m particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality. But I’m sure there is even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. And then, I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: I think, there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are for remote work. And it’s pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to normal than they are today, obviously. I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely. And so, I suspect that trend will accelerate some. I think that’s probably also true about working remotely in some areas and in some jobs. And so, I think we have significant solutions and products for all of those groups. On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that we’re looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we viewed that that area was a huge opportunity for the Company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so, you will see us continue on that. I wouldn’t say that the health door opened wider. I would say, it was already opened fairly wide.
Katy Huberty: Okay. And then, as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So, just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion. And then, related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?
Luca Maestri: Let me answer that, Katy. First of all, on the buyback. As I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years and it’s not changing now. Keep in mind here, we’re talking about just the authorization, right? And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we’ve received from our Board, right? So it’s the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90. And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So, nothing really has changed there. And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. We’ve been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. We’re always looking for ways to accelerate our product roadmaps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the services side. So, we will continue to do that. And so, also on the M&A front, nothing has changed.
Tejas Gala: Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off on the channel inventory. I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory look like in the March quarter, because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then, the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation.
Tim Cook: Amit, it’s Tim. If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. It’s not unusual that we reduce in Q2. In fact, if you look back, generally speaking, in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories; during the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. That’s a seasonal thing. And sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. So, hopefully, that answers your question. And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position. You could conclude from that that we were within a target range.
Amit Daryanani: That’s really helpful. Maybe just for follow-up. Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about, how do you think about Apple’s manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything in the Company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months, how do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?
Tim Cook: As you know, our supply chain is global. And so, our products are truly made everywhere. And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States; we have final assembly in China as well. I think, you’d have to conclude, or at least I conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that it’s durable and resilient. And so, I feel good about where we are. That said, we’re always looking at tweaks. And it’s just not something we talk about, because if we view it as confidential and competitive information. And so, we will look at the -- as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: We’ll hear from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank
Jeriel Ong: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. So, I want to focus my question on Services. The segment was solid in the quarter despite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see the logic behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that sustains or at some point does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line?
Luca Maestri: Jeriel, let me take that one. We typically don’t give a lot of specifics about our categories. But I’ve said, as we look into the June quarter, we see two distinct trends in our services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits, the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so, we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our music business, cloud services. So, we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is AppleCare. AppleCare is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchase our devices. Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures. And not only our retail stores, but also our partners points of sale, and obviously, the reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures. Right? And we do expect AppleCare to be affected during the during the June quarter.The other business, which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News, and the third party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So, these are two things that during the June quarter will create a headwind for the Services business.
Jeriel Ong: Got it. I appreciate that. My second question is about the overall purchasing decisions the consumers are making. So far, through April, have you seen increased perhaps downtick across your product line? So for example, somebody might have shift maybe toward the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward, as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through the rest of ‘20? Thanks.
Tim Cook: I haven’t seen what you’re asking. No. I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. But it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology, or coming over from it from Android. So, those are the two principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down, as you’re talking about it. We’ve also seen -- we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this and the reception there has also been incredibly good. And that’s obviously our top of the line iPad. And so, I’m not seeing what you’re alluding to, at least at this point.
Tejas Gala: Thanks, Jeriel. Can we have the next question, please.
Operator: That will be from JP Morgan’s Samik Chatterjee.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If I can just start with a question on kind of what you’re seeing in China. You mentioned going to the pickup in activity. But, is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores, or what’ve you seen relative to online activity, and how much of this recovery is being driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?
Tim Cook: Yes. What we saw in China for the full quarter -- and I’ll speak about mainland China because I think that’s the source of your question. We saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables, and in Services. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January, and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed. And then, in March, as stores reopened, the recovery began. And then, we’ve seen further recovery in April. Where that goes, we will see. But that’s kind of what we’ve seen so far there.To your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There has been, however, more move to online. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, it’s pretty phenomenal actually. Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter. And that’s despite stores being closed for the three-week period around the world. And ex China -- and then China was closed prior to that three weeks. And that’s partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China, but it was also other regions as well. So, there is definitely a move. And whether that’s a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far, because I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that.
Samik Chatterjee: If I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you’re seeing for iPhone SE. Just given the price point, I’m wondering if you are expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what do you see for other iPhones from the line up on, just giving the lower price point?
Tim Cook: I think, it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better in areas where the median incomes are less. And so, we’ll see how that plays out. And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. So, it’s an unbelievable offer. It’s, if you will, the engine of our top phones in a very affordable package. And I think -- and it’s faster than the fastest Android phones. And so, it’s an exceptional value.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. Our last question today will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. And I guess, coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that at a lower price point. What does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does that imply for gross margins?
Tim Cook: Chris, we’ve always been about delivering the best product at a good price. And that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. It’s great to bring it back. It was a beloved product. And so, I wouldn’t read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.
Chris Caso: Okay. As a follow-up -- the follow-up question is on commodity pricing. And I think, you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter. If you could talk about what you expect, as you go through the year, perhaps in this new environment, and again, whether that turns into a challenge or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second half?
Tim Cook: Yes. For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing increase slightly while DRAM and displays and the other commodities declined. For the June quarter, we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity prices we expect to decline.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Chris. A replay of today’s call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

78;AAPL;2020-07-30;"Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Tejas Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Before we begin, I joined the many millions across this country in mourning and memorialize Congressman John Lewis, who was laid to rest earlier today. We've lost a hero who walked among us, a leader in the truest sense who urged this country to aim higher and be better until the very end. I was humbled and fortunate to know him and as an Alabama native his example inspires me still. It now falls to every American to be a living memorial to John Lewis and to carry forward the work and the mission that defined his life. Throughout the call I'll speak in greater detail about Apple's support for equity and justice topics of great urgency on a number of fronts, but first I want to pull the lens back to consider the quarter and full. In an uncertain environment Apple saw a quarter of historic results demonstrating the important role our products play in our customers' lives. We set a June quarter record with revenue of $59.7 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Both products and services set June quarter records and grew double-digits and revenue grew in each of our geographic segments, reflecting the broad base of this success. As always and especially in times of real adversity, what makes us proud as a company is not merely what we did, but how we did it. As millions March for justice in big cities and small towns alike, we committed a $100 million to launch Apple's racial equity and justice initiative as well as new and renewed internal efforts to foster diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company. As COVID-19 continues to represent great risks for individuals and great uncertainty for our communities, care and adaptability are defining how we conduct our work wherever we work. In some places that has met responsibly reopening our operations and retail stores with enhanced health and safety precautions. In others, where the virus has reemerge it's meant taking the challenging, but necessary step of re-closing stores. I'll touch on these topics more in a little bit. But first I want to offer some more context on the quarter's results. Due to the uncertain and ongoing impacts of COVID-19, we did not provide our typical guidance when we reported our results last quarter, but we did provide some color on how we expected the June quarter to play out. I'd like to contextualize our results in terms of that color across each of our product categories beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue grew 2% this quarter. In April, we expected year-over-year performance to worsen, but we saw better-than-expected demand in May and June. We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes including a strong iPhone SE launch, continued economic stimulus, and potentially some benefit from shelter in place restrictions lifting around the world. We expected iPad and Mac growth to accelerate and we saw very strong double-digit growth for these devices this quarter. This remarkable performance came in spite of supply constraints on both products. We're working hard to get more iPads and Macs into customers' hands as quickly as possible recognizing how integral they have become to working and learning from home providing entertainment and staying connected with loved ones. Wearables growth decelerated as we expected, but still grew by strong double-digits and set a revenue record for a non-holiday quarter. Building on powerful new features built into watchOS 7 and AirPods Pro announced this quarter, we are very excited about the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. These strong results helped drive our installed base of active devices to new all-time records across each of our product categories. Reflecting the deep integration of hardware, software and services, services generated a June quarter record of $13.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year. As we mentioned during our last call, there were two distinct trends we were seeing and they played out as we thought. First, results for advertising and AppleCare were impacted by the reduced level of economic activity and store closures to a degree that was in line with our expectations. Second, we had strong performance in our digital services with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services as well as elevated engagement on iMessage, Siri and FaceTime. Customers are loving new offerings across Apple services like Apple News today, our new daily audio briefing and Greyhound, our new summer blockbuster starring Tom Hanks. In fact, Apple TV+ just hit a history making 95 awards nominations and 25 wins and accolades. Based on these results and our performance over the last four quarters, we are proud to announce that we have achieved our goal of doubling. Our fiscal 2016 services revenue six months ahead of schedule. We're conscious of the fact that these results stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small and certainly for families. We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity and especially in times like this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success and that everything we make, build or do is geared towards creating opportunities for others. The App Store is a great example. This quarter, a new study by independent economists at the Analysis Group founded the App Store facilitated more than 0.5 trillion in commerce globally in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID-19, you can measure economic resilience in the ways in which the App Store supports remote ordering for restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses and an enduring entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries. Keeping learning vibrant and impactful in the time of COVID-19 is a priority everyone shares. Earlier this month, we announced significant enhancements to the development Swift and Everyone Can Code curricula and we launched a new professional learning course available exclusively to educators. In just two weeks ago, our Community Education initiative added 10 more historically black college and university regional coding centers to our roster, bringing the total to 24 locations nationwide, 12 of which are HBCUs and 21 of which serve majority black and brown student populations. In Apple's backyard, we announced that we are allocating $400 million of our multi-year $2.5 billion affordable housing commitment to new housing construction, homebuyer assistance programs and support for those at greatest risk of experiencing homelessness across Silicon Valley. Apple's results this quarter are only possible due to our people and their ongoing ingenuity, flexibility, resilience and determination during these ever-changing times. I want to thank our AppleCare and retail teams who have paired exceptional service during a time of intense demand with great adaptability during a quarter where stores have reopened in some places and reclosed in others. A dedicated team of specialists and experts has shouldered the task of caring for the well-being of our teams and communities store by store, location by location with evidence driven granularity and agility that is unrivaled anywhere. Innovation from adversity certainly define this year's Worldwide Developers Conference as well. This is an event where traditionally Apple's worldwide community of developers gathers together to share, celebrate and do big things together. Though we could not be together in person, Apple set a new standard for what online events can achieve with our celebrated all virtual event. The results here speak for themselves. More than 22 million viewers tuned in across all of Apple streams. For our developers we distributed more than 72 hours of video content. That's three full days of video. The weak saw more than 200 direct video engineering and design sessions and about 4500 person to person appointments with developers across 227 virtual labs. And of course that's even before you get to this year's announcements from iOS 14, which boasts the radical redesign to the home screen, powerful updates to messages, streamlined and effortless app clips and even greater privacy transparency and controls to major updates to Apple Pencil, Siri and calling and iPad OS 14 to much anticipated sleep tracking, new fitness and wellness features and unprecedented customization and watchOS 7 to the new macOS Big Sur boasting the biggest redesign upgrade to macOS since OS X. No less important for Apple's innovation roadmap is our transition to Apple silicon for the Mac. This two-year effort will achieve both unprecedented performance for the Mac and a common architecture across all Apple products. Looking forward, we are profoundly optimistic about Apple's future and we recognize that with this success comes some real responsibility to lead with our values because those values help make that success possible in the first place. We are just as proud of our announcement this month that Apple will be fully carbon-neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and including the energy use of every device we make as we are of any hardware innovation because they spring from the same instinct to leave the world better than we found it. We're committed to standing with those marching for the lives and dignity through our new $100 million commitment to Apple's racial equity and justice initiative, and we're deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts internally because our future as a business is inextricably linked with the future of our communities. There are times when things seem to move slowly when needed progress, economic or social themes bogged down when the instinct to turn away from the horizon and hold onto what you've got fields and ex-capable, and then there are times like this when people of goodwill step forward, when progressed on Moore's itself, when the insistence of hope forces something new. This is an immensely challenging moment. COVID-19 is still devastating many places and we have work left to do to care for the health and well-being of the communities in which all of us live and work. But no community of people, whether a company or a country, can afford to miss this call when it comes. At Apple, we never have and we don't intend to start now. With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter was a testament to Apple's ability to innovate and execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the resilience of our business and the relevance of our products and services in our customers' lives. Total revenue was $59.7 billion, a new June quarter record, up 11% from a year ago, despite a 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Our performance was strong across our entire portfolio as we grew revenue in each of our product categories and set June quarter records for Mac, for Wearables and for services. Similarly, our results were very strong all around the world with growth in all geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, in Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific. Products revenue was $46.5 billion, up 10% and a June quarter record. iPhone returned to growth and we saw very strong double-digit growth from iPad, Mac and Wearables. Lockdowns and point of sale closures were widespread during April and impacted our performance, but we saw demand for all products improve significantly in May and June. As a result of our strong performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories. Our services continue to grow strongly up 15% year-over-year and reached a June quarter record of $13.2 billion. We set all-time records in many services categories and June quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover this in more detail later. Company gross margin was 38%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially due to unfavorable FX of 90 basis points and a different mix of products partially offset by cost savings and services mix. Products gross margin was 29.7% decreasing 60 basis points sequentially due to FX and a different mix partially offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 67.2% up 180 basis points sequentially mainly due to mix. Net income was $11.3 billion and earnings per share were $2.58, up 18% and a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was also a June quarter record at $16.3 billion, an improvement of $4.6 billion over a year ago. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 2% to $26.4 billion with customer demand improving as the quarter progressed. COVID-19 was most impactful during the first three weeks of April when lockdowns and point of sale closures became more widespread in many countries. We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages. Our active installed base of iPhones again reached an all-time high as a result of the loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact in the US the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Turning to services, as I said, we set a June quarter record of $13.4 billion of revenue. We had all-time record performance and strong double-digit growth in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services. Our new services Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card are also contributing to overall services growth and continue to add usersâ content and features. At the same time customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow at a fast pace. The number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter with paid accounts increasing double-digits in each of our geographic segments. In aggregate, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially and we now have over 550 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 130 million from a year ago. With this momentum we remain confident to reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new June quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company and we set June quarter records in the majority of markets we track. Importantly Apple Watch continues to extend its reach with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter new to the product. Next, I'd like to talk about the impressive performance of Mac. Revenue was $7.1 billion, up 22% over last year and a June quarter record. We grew double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific as well as June quarter records in the Americas and Europe. Customer response to our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches has been extremely strong. iPad performance was equally impressive with revenue of $6.6 billion, up 31% and our highest June quarter revenue in eight years. Demand was strong around the world with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments, including a June quarter record in Greater China. The launch of our new iPad Pro has been received incredibly well in every region of the world. Both Mac and iPad are extremely relevant products in the new working and learning environments and the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac and 97% for iPad. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And as a result, the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. Our retail business had record June quarter revenue. Thanks to the performance of our online store which had records in all geographic segments and grew across all major product categories. In June, we launched Apple Card Monthly Installments for more products in our US stores allowing customers to pay for their devices all the time with 0% interest. We're very pleased with the level of customer interest this new offering has generated. In the enterprise market, we continue to see companies leverage Apple products and offerings to successfully navigate their businesses through COVID-19. In healthcare, we are seeing rapid acceleration of telehealth to support a more flexible model of patient care. Many hospitals such as UVA Health, Rush University Medical Center and UC San Diego Health are using apps on iPad and iPhone to have triage, monitor and care for patients who are at home. This helps free up hospital capacity to support patients who need inpatient care while enabling continued care for patients who do not require in-person visits. Since many call center employees are currently working remotely, Apple Business Chat has proven an invaluable tool for staying connected with customers. This quarter HSBC deployed Apple Business Chat in its US and UK contact centers. Apple Business Chat provides a flexible and secured channel for digital banking assistance through a native Apple experience improving the efficiency and experience for both customers and agents. We are seeing similar adoption by hundreds of other organizations. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $8.5 billion of new term debt, retired $7.4 billion of term debt and increased short-term borrowing facilities by $1.1 billion during the quarter leaving us with total debt of $113 billion. As a result, net cash was $81 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the June quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $10 billion through open market repurchases of 31.3 million Apple shares. We also began a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 15.2 million shares. And finally, we retired an additional 4.8 million shares in the final settlement of our 15th ASR. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Similar to last quarter, given the uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we will not be issuing revenue and margin guidance for the coming quarter. However, we will provide some additional insight on our expectations for the September quarter for our product categories. On iPhone, we expect to see recent performance continue for our current product lineup, including the strong customer response for iPhone SE. In addition, as you know, last year we started selling new iPhones in late September. This year we project supply to be available a few weeks later. We expect the rest of our product categories to have strong year-over-year performance. For services, we expect the September quarter to have the same trends that we have observed during the June quarter except for AppleCare where during the September quarter a year ago we expanded our distribution significantly. As a consequence, we expect a difficult comp for AppleCare also considering the COVID related point of sale closures this year. For gross margin, keep in mind that we will have a different mix than in prior years as I just explained. For OpEx, we expect to be between $9.8 billion and $9.9 billion. We expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% and OI&E to be $50 million. Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on August 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2020. And finally, today we're announcing a four for one split of Apple common stock to make our stock more accessible to a broader base of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020 will receive three additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31st, 2020. With that let's open the call to questions.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we please have the first question?
Operator: Yes, that will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple is leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period, while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time and then I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Yes. As Luca mentioned, in June we actually rolled out to the overwhelming balance of our other products the ability to do interest rate, interest free financing in our stores with payments. And that's in addition to trade-in which is becoming a more common trend now which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, against the price of the new phone. And so when you compound these two things with the financing and the trade-in it makes the product super affordable. And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.
Katy Huberty: And then, as a follow-up, just specifically to iPhone the category returned to growth. As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. Our math would suggest that replacement cycles in some cases are elongated. And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. Does all of that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth after what's been six quarters of decline?
Tim Cook: We're very pleased with how we did on iPhone. It was better than we thought largely because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks May and June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active installed base. The fact that if you look in the major geographies like the US, we had the top two selling smartphones. In the UK we had three of the top four. In Australia, we had five of the top six. And in Japan we had the top four. Urban China we were, iPhone 11 was the top selling smartphone in the country. And so these are some very different geographies with their very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well. The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. And it also seems to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And as we -- as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Katy.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.
Tim Cook: Thank you so much.
Tejas Gala: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Yes, that would be from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, Tim, when you look at the services business and in terms of your TV+ content production have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts? And along the same path four years ago your premonition on services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected, I don't know if you want to make any such forecast four years out and how you think services revenue is going to be. Then I have a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook: I'm sorry. I missed that second question because the audio didn't come through. But I think I got the gist of the first. And that is production has been affected for Apple TV+ as I think it has for most people. We are working to get restarted. I don't have a precise date yet when we will get it restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for those that are shut in the LA area given the current status of the virus and those. And I'm sorry I missed your, the second part of your question.
Krish Sankar: Yes, Tim, I was trying to see, four years ago you made a great prediction that services is going to be $50 billion by 2020. I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction four years down the road?
Tim Cook: We're not updating today. We feel good. We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling six months early. And we do have still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're shooting for later in the year at 600 million. So we do have that objective out there.
Krish Sankar: If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. With the strong sales in Mac given the shelter-in-place, do you think the back-to-school season got pulled in by a quarter or do you expect the momentum to still continue? Thank you very much.
Luca Maestri: As I said, when I was talking about providing some commentary for the September quarter, we expect all the non-iPhone product categories to have a very strong year-over-year performance. So we definitely, I mean, the back-to-school season is clearly this one and we are very excited not only for the Mac, but also for the iPad. We've got a fantastic lineup of products and we know that these products are incredibly relevant especially given the current circumstances. So we expect the performance that we've seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Yes. From Cross Research we'll hear from Shannon Cross.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I know the revenue was up 2% and I think Luca talked about record iPad, but just curious as to given their 5G  how you're seeing the market play out? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Shannon, the growth that we -- we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%, currency affected China, a bit more than in other places, it affected 400 basis points. And so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. As I had mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been number one in urban China and so we're very, very proud of that. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work from home and distance learning as it was in other geographies and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. And services set a new June quarter record there. We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there, to give you a perspective, about three out of four customers that are buying the Mac are new in China and about two out of three that are buying the iPad are new. And so these are numbers that we're super proud of.
Shannon Cross: Great. And then, can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac Silicon in-house, then the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Thanks. Yes, I mean, what we will end up -- what we'll end up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some interesting things that we can do in products that are -- that is sort of unleashes another round of innovation. And so I don't want to say a lot about it, other than we are extremely excited about it, it's something that we've worked on quite a while to get to this point and we're looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple Silicon later in the year.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please.
Operator: That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question guys. I have one and a follow-up as well. Fortunately, I guess, Tim, if I think about the strength, you're seeing with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend coming from? Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter or which is getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem because, clearly these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and upcoming refresh cycle that we have?
Tim Cook: I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and some -- probably some pick up because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time. And probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June as Store started to reopen. And so it's a combination of all of those. And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. And so when you combine the -- a strong cycle plus and iPhone SE launch, plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that we're going in the right direction there.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect, that's helpful. And then I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins? What do you think of the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter, but over the next one to two years? And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margin starts to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now.
Luca Maestri: Yes. Well, let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. We were at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. And really the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the US dollar, so the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously that is something to keep in mind. And then, the other aspect; I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products. They have different margin profiles. And so sometimes a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products gross margins and we are very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and Wearables but obviously, it's a different mix. Going forward, the variables are always the same, is that the foreign exchange will continue to play an impact, the mix of products there, we're going to be selling, will have an impact as well. The commodities market has been relatively benign and we'll see how that plays out over time. As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar and we plan to continue to make a good trade off decisions between revenue and units and margins.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: It will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.
Kyle McNealy: Hi, thanks a lot for the question. Our team in Asia recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. It showed that there is still a high proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7, 8 devices. I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. I wonder if you can tell us whether there is anything else that you're doing to get these customers in your latest technology? What made those customers be looking for and how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Customers upgraded different at a different pace and I don't have in front of me the exact installed base data from China. But much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some, it extended some during the depths if you will of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world, and probably to some degree is happening still at this point. The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver product that people can't imagine, going through life about. And obviously keep rolling out these programs that makes the front-end purchase be much less, and this is things like the financing in the trade-in programs that you mentioned. And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.
Kyle McNealy: Okay, great, thanks. And one more if I may. Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results, that's really impressive. I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pull-forward and what might be the future upgrades in next few years? Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there is a hangover period maybe after the back-to-school season or holiday season. That would be helpful. Thanks.
Tim Cook: The installed base is growing and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high in the close to 50% kind of range. And so, that to me, makes the -- bodes well for the future. There is clearly, as we had indicated, there is some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably affect wearables and iPhone, the other direction. And -- but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work. And we believe we're going to have a strong back to school season. Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Kyle.
Kyle McNealy: Great. Thanks very much.
Tejas Gala: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Cleveland Research's Ben Bollin.
Ben Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is? You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad. Interested, where you think inventory is across major product categories. And then I had a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook: We usually -- we've gotten away from talking about channel inventories. But to give you a perspective sitting here looking at it, on iPhone the inventory is slightly less than it was a year ago and that's I'm saying that at a quarter end point, so at the end of Q3. And obviously iPad and Mac are constrained and so both of those are less than they were in the year ago quarter.
Ben Bollin: Okay. And then, Luca, I'm interested, any color you could share about the impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter, be it work from home, stipends, travel, other employee support costs. And also how the company is thinking about the longer-term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe more permanently many considerations and how that could influence the future OpEx? Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Well, on the OpEx front, there are being obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions. Obviously, travel, it is a perfect example. The number of meetings that we have internally, some of those costs have been reduced. We've also invested heavily in initiatives for example, we're really trying to help during a very difficult circumstances. For example, we have had a program for example where we match our employee donations, we made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. On a net basis, I would say probably the cost have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, in most -- the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. And then we'll see, I mean, we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. We've taken a very cautious approach of both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in number of geographies around the world. We've reopened here in the United States. We've had to re-close some of the stores yet here in the United States, as the number of cases has gone up. And we will continue to track how the virus is doing. And hopefully at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. And so we will make those decisions as we get more information.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will be from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.
Jeriel Ong: Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. I'd like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the services line all-time record for the quarter. I'm just curious whether you think that will sustain, I understand within services is a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and I'm wondering if that should continue to improve.
Tim Cook: Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross margin for services. And that was driven primarily by mix as you said, right. We have a very broad portfolio and depending on which one of the services does better than we have an impact on Services gross margins. We like the Services business because it is -- it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter, but we want to offer very competitive services across the board and the same -- I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive to a certain extent with our margins are, that's the margins are a byproduct of our success in the marketplace.
Jeriel Ong: Got it, really appreciate that. And I wanted to ask question on the Wearables segment. It seems to me that you're categorizing the Wearables business as maybe being a little bit impact from pandemic similar to the iPhones. And it's the first time that Wearables hasn't materially upsided and at least a while in recent memory. I guess the drivers of the Wearables being Watch and predominantly Watch and AirPods. What are your thoughts going forward on whether there is a little bit of pent-up demand perhaps that might resume ads that will get back to a more normalized environment?
Tim Cook: I think on the Watch in particular is like the iPhone more affected by store closures, because people -- some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. And so I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. I was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter, we were going to come out from the color that we gave you. So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. So we will end up being, we're very pleased with how we did. But the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iPhone.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Jeriel.
Jeriel Ong: Got it. Really appreciate that.
Tejas Gala: Yes. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. And I have two questions. I'll ask them at the same time and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, the coronavirus, your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming one of the hurdles. So congratulations to you. As you look forward, say to the Christmas holiday shopping season, and given the economic challenges around the world of virus, coronavirus and your product launches and things like that. Can you give me commentary maybe how this Christmas you're looking forward, to say, maybe some past cycles of Christmas? Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than may be some of the past years. And then for Luca, I think you made a quick comment, Luca, that you mentioned something about a few weeks later, was Apple like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches or maybe expand upon that. I know things are more difficult, but I didn't quite keep the commentary, it was in your prepared comments, we'll go about a few weeks late that let's just have a quick little blood. Thank you so much, gentlemen.
Tim Cook: Yes, we take it one quarter at a time. And so, we'll give you color on the December quarter and October. Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or therapeutic or both. And there is some optimism around that and in that particular timeframe. And so, we'll see, I don't have any information that is publicly available there. But I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it begins to happen and I think that any kind of consumer style company would benefit from that.
Luca Maestri: And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that we launched a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. So I was referring to the new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.
Jim Suva: Great. Congratulations to you and your entire organization and teams. Thank you so much.
Tim Cook: Thanks so much.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: That will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base? And have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and services? Then I have a follow-on.
Tim Cook: We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and the store closures occurred, we could see that across the Card. It affected the categories that you would guess the most like travel and entertainment et cetera. But overall if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're very happy with the number of people that have Apple Card. We believe based on what we've heard that it's the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards and so we feel very good about that.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And as a follow-up, now that Apple has Apple Silicon for Macs. Would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor or is this going to be forever for Apple use?
Tim Cook: Well, I don't want to make a forever comment, but there are -- we are a product company and we love making the whole thing. And because if we can -- on the user experience in that way and with the goal of delighting the user. And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple Silicon is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple Silicon that we couldn't achieve otherwise. And so that's how we look at it.
Wamsi Mohan: Thanks, Tim.

79;AAPL;2020-10-29;"Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn things over to Tejas Gala, Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we’ll open the call to questions from analysts.
Tim Cook: Thanks Tejas. Good afternoon and thanks for joining the call today. Back in April, I said we were in the most challenging environment in which Apple as a company has ever operated. That atmosphere of uncertainty, of resolve, of making difficult calls with limited information has not only come to define Apple’s year, but each of our lives as individuals across this country, and around the world. It has been a chapter that none of us will forget. In the face of these challenges, Apple stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, seeing in every obstacle an opportunity to do something new, something creative, something better on behalf of our customers. Today we report a quarter and a fiscal year that reflects that effort. This quarter, Apple achieved revenue of $64.7 billion, a September quarter record, despite the anticipated absence of new iPhone availability during the quarter, and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, including closures at many of our retail locations. We also set a new all-time record for Mac and Services. Outside of iPhone, each of our product categories saw strong double digit year-over-year growth, despite supply constraints in several product categories. Our results for this quarter were ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone and Services performance. As we anticipated, we launched new iPhone models in October, a few weeks later than last year’s mid-September launch. Up to that mid-September point, customer demand for iPhone was very strong, and grew double-digits. On Services, we saw stronger-than-expected performance across the board. Geographically, we set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. We also set a September quarter record in India, thanks in part to a very strong reception to this quarter’s launch of our online store in the country. Greater China is the region that was most heavily impacted by the absence of the new iPhones during the September quarter, still we beat our internal expectations in the region, growing non-iPhone revenue strong double digits and iPhone customer demand grew through mid-September.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report today a new September quarter revenue record, which caps a remarkable level of performance for our fiscal year 2020, during which we set new all-time records for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow, in spite of an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. We could not be more proud of the way our team has innovated and executed, throughout this unprecedented period of uncertainty. We reported total revenue of $64.7 billion for the September quarter, up 1% from a year ago. This is a very impressive level of performance, when we consider that this year; we did not launch and ship any new iPhone models during the quarter. Outside of iPhone, we grew 25% in aggregate, and had strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in each of our product categories. We set all-time records for Mac and Services, and a September quarter record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also achieved new September quarter records in the vast majority of countries that we track, including among others, The U.S., Canada Brazil, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, India, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $50.1 billion with very strong underlying performance across each product category. Our products outside of iPhone grew a combined 30%, despite supply constraints on iPad, Mac and Apple Watch throughout the quarter. For iPhone, through mid-September, customer demand grew double-digits. As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in aggregate, and in each of our major product categories.
Tejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask you that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.
Operator: Certainly we'll hear first today from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.
ShannonCross: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit more about China? And in terms of linearity, I think Luca, you'd mentioned that services in all regions were up at an all time high. I'm not sure exactly what your comment was. But, maybe give us a little idea of, whether you're seeing any blowback or benefits in the Huawei situation and just dig a bit more into the trends we're seeing in China, and then have a follow up. Thank you.
TimCook: Thanks, Shannon. If you look at China, and look at last quarters, I'll talk about both last quarter and this quarter, the last quarter, what we saw was our non iPhone business was up strong double digit for the full quarter. And then if you look at iPhone and you look at it in two parts one, pre mid September, which is pre the point at which the previous year, we would have launched iPhones that period of time which was the bulk of the quarter iPhone was growing from a customer demand point of view. And of course not shipping new iPhones for the last two weeks of September makes that number in the aggregate a negative but the net is the underlying business in China last quarter was very strong and perhaps very different than you might think from just a quick look at the stated number In terms of this quarter, given the explanation for last quarter and the momentum that we've got, and as importantly given the initial data points that we see on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, although we don't guide to revenue as Lucas said, I would tell you that we're confident that we will grow this quarter in China. And so we're very bullish on what's going on there. A little more color on last quarter, we had a much more significant inventory draw down on the channel side than other regions. And so that is one reason why the numbers are different than other regions. And additionally, the new products in the year ago quarter were a higher percentage of our iPhone sales than they were in other regions. So hopefully that explains what's going on in China. In terms of the market there, 5G is fairly advanced there. They're forecasting 600,000 base stations by the end of the year. And so we're entering the market at a very good time, and with the reception that we've gotten so far; we're very confident there.
ShannonCross: Okay, great. And then can you talk a bit about just overall in the world, the cadence that you see sort of for the 5G adoption launch, what you see will be sort of the key drivers, obviously, there's a fair amount of subsidies going on in the US at this point. Thank you.
TimCook: Yes, we're working hard to provide the best experience for iPhone users. To do so we've been collaborating closely with carriers all around the world to ensure iPhone has great throughput and coverage and battery and call quality. We've completed 5G testing so far on over 100 carriers in over 30 regions. And so it's pretty, it's pretty pervasive around the world. But grantedly, it will continue to roll out in more places as carriers continue to expand their coverage. And this will happen every week. And so it's just going to get better. There are obvious places in the world where it's more ahead than others. But we feel like we are entering at a sort of at exactly the right time.
Operator: That will be from Jeriel Ong from Deutsche Bank.
JerielOng: Yes, thank you so much. I guess I appreciate the guidance for revenue to grow but I guess my question, perhaps, if I could, is relative to seasonality, you guys over the last five years of seasonality is typically above 50% quarter-on-quarter, do you think that you can beat that, even with the later release? And I have a follow up.
LucaMaestri: So as I said, Jay, we're not providing a range, for the reasons that I explained during my prepared remarks. So you need to keep in mind a couple of things that are unique about this quarter versus the past. And that I mentioned again, the launch timing of the phones is different from the past. So we are launching the new iPhones, four weeks into the quarter for two models for the 12 and 12 Pro and seven weeks into the quarter for the other two, the iPhone Mini and for 12 Pro Max. So that is something to keep in mind as you think about the growth rates. With regard to all the other product categories, as I said, we are expecting to grow double digits essentially across the board for the rest of our products and for services. And so we are incredibly optimistic about what we've seen so far. Obviously, we started taking pre orders five days ago and it's a bit early for the phone. But we think that there are a lot of tailwinds this year for iPhone for the entire cycle. Some of the comments that Tim has already made, right, we've got the best lineup of iPhones that we've ever had. We got an install base of iPhone that is very large continues to grow. It's an all time high. Obviously, 5G is a once in a decade, opportunity. And as you've seen in some markets, certainly here in the United States, carrier offers are very aggressive. And so that is very good for consumers and ultimately, very good for us. So very, very optimistic, given what we've seen so far.
JerielOng: Awesome, thank you so much for that context and given us some of the levers to think about. I'd like to ask a little bit more of a strategic one, a little bit longer term in nature. I think one thing is interesting about the Apple one bundle is the desire two bundles in the first place, I guess. I'm wondering, and some investors have asked me this as well, is that why wouldn't you also take that rationale perhaps in hardware, perhaps maybe AirPods and iPhone or AirPods watch and iPhone? Because if it makes sense to bundle services, would it also make sense to bundle hardware? And if that's not the case, then are there benefits of services, bundling that don't necessarily translate to hardware bundling? Thanks.
TimCook: Yes, we don't have anything to announce today at our hardware bundle but backing up a bit. And we do view that people like to pay for their hardware are at least some substantial portion of it monthly. And so that's the reason that we have implemented installments in our stores and online. And that's the reason you see in some of the channels too selling the hardware on a per month kind of basis. If that begins to look like a subscription, perhaps to some buyers because they're used to holding the phone for a fixed period of time and then turning it over and using the residual value of that phone in a way that gives them a de facto kind of subsidy on a new phone. And so there is something today in the market that works somewhat similar. On the services side; we have -- we had customers coming to us and asking for an easier way to buy all of our services. And we wanted to provide that and we're looking forward to tomorrow to getting Apple one out there.
Operator: It will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
KatyHuberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. New technologies, including the chips that support 5G put upward pressure on cost this year. But you managed to leave ASPS for iPhones relatively unchanged this product cycle. How should we think about the margin profiles of iPhone 12 relative to past iPhone cycles?
LucaMaestri: Hi, Katy. Obviously, we don't provide any outlook at the gross margin level for product categories. What I said in my prepared remarks, we expect gross margins in total for the company to be pretty much in line with what we've seen during the last quarter. Because obviously, as you said, it's very good, right, because we are offering the new phones at price points that are essentially unchanged. And we are taking on a lot of new technology into the phones. I would say the commodity environment is good. For the first time in many, many quarters, I don't have to say that foreign exchange is a headwind and getting into the quarter is not going to be a factor during the quarter. As we've made it clear in our comments, we are bullish about our sales performance expectation, so we should be getting some leverage. And so I think that the gross margin dynamics are good and it's very good to see that we're able to offer so much more technology and still able to deliver the level of gross margins that I think investors are expecting.
KatyHuberty: Okay and shifting to the services business. This isn't dependent on certainly any one service but licensing and other historically has been a driver of growth. That's where the ad based revenue comes in. When you think about the Google antitrust pressure, what's the risk that you see some shrinkage in your licensing and others segment within services and do you see opportunities for other services to make up for any potential weakness?
KatyHuberty: We've got Katy, as you know; we've announced a number of services over the last couple of years. And we are ramping those between Apple TV plus and Apple News plus and Apple Kay, we've got Apple Card. We've got Apple Fitness Plus coming. We've got a number of services that have been launched a bit longer that are doing really well from the app store to iCloud, and So there's a lot of room their input and potential there. I have no idea how the DOJ suit will go, but I think it's a long way from a conclusion on it.
Operator: That will come from Evercore's Amit Daryanani.
AmitDaryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. First off, Tim, on iPhones, you talked about the iPhone install data thing being the highest and largest ever been satisfaction rates, obviously pretty high. And our data would suggest replacement cycles are getting elongated. And if I take all of that together, along with the fact that, if iPhone user like me with embarrassingly high weekly usage rate, does that in aggregate give you better confident, better clarity that we could enter an extensive period of iPhone revenue growth versus what we seen the last couple of years.
TimCook: We're very bullish on this cycle, very bullish on it, because as I sort of step back from it and look at what we've now done, we have for the first time ever, we've launched four iPhones. And there is an iPhone for everyone there. It is the strongest lineup we've ever had by far, we have -- we do have a very large, loyal and growing install base. And we're also reaching out to switchers. And so I'm very optimistic there. We've got a once in a decade opportunity with 5G. There's a lot of excitement around 5G. And we've got some aggressive offers in the marketplace. And so when I think about all of those, I'm really and I look at the initial data points that we've got on the iPhone 12 and the 12 Pro, we are off to a great start.
AmitDaryanani: Got it. And I guess, Luca had a follow up to you on the services gross margin it just was to kind of continue to move higher rather nicely. Do you think this level at 67% essentially is sustainable? And what do you think are the two or three factors that are enabling these gross margins to remain here as we go forward?
LucaMaestri: I mean, obviously, we're very pleased with the level of gross margins in services, as you said; they've been expanding almost 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reason for that is, of course that, we are growing the services revenue, and therefore we're getting leverage on a lot of these services, right. Some of it, as explained in the past, we have a portfolio of services that got different margin profiles. And so sometimes, depending on the mix of products we have, we can see margin expansion through mix, as well. And so, but we're also launching new services that where we need to invest heavily up front. And but we think we've been able to show, for example, this year that we've launched a lot of new services, made all the necessary investments and still being able to expand gross margin. So we feel quite confident about that trajectory that we have, that we have for services and we're very, very happy to see the customer response to really all of them, because as we've mentioned earlier, I mean, we've seen revenue records across essentially every category and in across the entire world, right? We've seen September quarter records in every geography around the world. So of the dynamics, all the levers that we have in the services business are working very well right now. And that translates also into margin, of course.
Operator: We'll hear from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
SamikChatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just want to start off with the iPhone lineup here, particularly as you mentioned, the carrier subsidies that you see mixed optimistic about iPhone sales. I think just looking at some other factors here. Earlier in the year, you had mentioned that iPhone sales was seeing an uptake with stimulus checks going out to consumers helping in the consumer spending overall here in the US. So as we see some delays here on that front, are you seeing anything change on the consumer spending side as a macro impacting? How you think about iPhone sales, particularly with -- even with the new product lineup? And I have a follow up. Thank you.
TimCook: It's prior to mid September, we were seeing double digit growth in customer demand on iPhone. So there's a lot of momentum there. And there is a lot of momentum even much more so now given the launch of the 12 Pro and the iPhone 12. If you're asking whether it could have been even more with a different macro spending environment? I believe the answer to be yes. But you can't run the experiment. And so I don't know for sure. But I suspect that just the COVID in general take something off from a worldwide economic point of view.
SamikChatterjee: Perfect. And if can just follow up just following up on that COVID discussion. We are potentially here looking at a second wave, right. And I think all companies are trying to prepare for that which you discussed as well in your prepared remarks. But if you can share any kind of thoughts about how you're preparing in relation to either inventory levels, or sourcing from the supply chain, to prepare for any potential disruption, like we had earlier this year?
TimCook: Well, we're doing everything we can do. But we're prioritizing safety first, obviously. And so with our stores as an example, we've come up with a new concept that puts an essentially turns the store into an express storefront. And we've implemented that in a number of places where we believe that helps from the safety of our employee and the safety of the customer's point of view, but still allows for an interaction to take place. And so we've also put a lot more people on the phones because a lot more people are reaching out to us in that way. And of course, the online store has stayed up and running through the whole of this. I think if you take some of those, the channel is doing some similar things and then some different things as well. And so I think everybody to the best of their ability is putting in contingency plans and finding a way to adapt to the environment. But it is difficult to call and there's a level of uncertainty in it, obviously. And that's what Luca was referring to earlier.
Operator: That will come from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.
KrishSankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, first on palooka. I understand you don't want to give color on gross margin by products or segments. But Luca you mentioned growth margin should be similar in December versus September. And so it should grow double digit, there's a general view that on the iPhone side, the bond cost would be headwind for gross margin, but carrier subsidies would be attainment. So I'm kind of curious, how should we think about the different, like gross margin levels into December quarter? And I have a follow up.
LucaMaestri: Yes. And so typically during the December quarter, we have positive factors because we have the typical seasonal leverage, right, sequentially as we go from September to the holiday season. And we also have an improved mix between products, particularly this year, as we've launched the new iPhone, at the same time, we shouldn't forget that we have launched a lot of new products. During the last several weeks, we launched four new models of iPhone; we launch new models of Apple watch new, models of iPads. And so, clearly every time we launch a new product, the cost structure is higher. And so that is going to be the other side of the coin. So but we think that those two things should balance out and again, as I was saying earlier, and we are accomplishing this while delivering a lot of new technologies, a lot of new features to our customers. This time for an exchange is not a factor and that's something that is a bit different from the past. So but that those are the pluses and minuses.
KrishSankar: Got it. Definitely helpful, Luca. And then a follow up for Tim. Tim, I kind of surprised you didn't say a lot about the payments ecosystem in this prepared comments kind of curious to find out from your advantage point, how you think of your whole payments ecosystem including Apple Card, Apple Pay, Apple Cash; now you're disaggregating the whole FinTech environment.
TimCook: Thanks for the question. There's just a limited number of things I can talk about is kind of a reason I didn't talk about it. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the whole Payment Services area. Apple Card is doing well. And Apple Pay is doing exceptionally well. As you can imagine in this environment, people are less want to hand over a card. So this contactless payment has taken on a different level of adoption in it that I think will never go back. The US has been lagging a bit in contactless payment. And I think that the pandemic may well get put the US on a different trajectory there. And so we are very bullish about this area and view that there are there are more things that Apple can do in this space. And in so it's an area of great interest to us.
Operator: That will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.
KyleMcNealy: Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the supply chain. Given your latest start from manufacturing to the flagship phone line of this year, do you think that supply will be able to meet demand through the end of the calendar? Are there any component shortages that you're seeing? Or are there any actions that you can take to increase weekly output versus last year? Thanks.
TimCook: Yes, Kyle, I don't know what you're talking about iPhone in particular. But if you look at iPhone, we are constrained today. And that's not a surprise where at the front end of the ramp, if you will, and how long we will be supply constrained, it's hard to predict. I mean, we haven't taken orders yet for the iPhone 12 Mini or the Pro Max either. And so those are coming in. So we shall see. But right now we are supply constrained, we are also supply constrained for avoidance of any confusion where supply constrained on Mac, we are supply constrained on iPad. And we're supply constrained on some Apple watches as well. And so we have a fair number of areas right now of focus, and we're working really, really hard to remedy those as quickly as we can. But at this point, I can't estimate when we'll be out of that.
KyleMcNealy: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And then switching to Mac and iPad. How do you think about the durability of the strength you've seen there with Mac and iPad? Is there any potential for stronger than seasonal pullback after the strong back to school season and holiday season? And these supply constraints make it feel like there's a good chance for continuation of the strong demand trends and in flow through of that. What do we think about the seasonality into December and March quarter being more positive in seasonal or less positive in seasonal? Thanks.
TimCook: Yes, we placed our thoughts in the color that Luca provided when he said that all products excluding iPhone, all products and services excluding iPhone or all products, rather excluding iPhone would grow in the double digits. And so we continue to be bullish on what Mac and iPad can do. I think the moves that have taken place to remote learning and remote work are not going to go back to normal, normal will become something different. Because I think people are learning that there are aspects of this that work well. And so I don't believe that we're going to go back to where we were. And I think that means that iPads and Macs are even more important in those environments. The growth in both of these last quarter were phenomenal as you can tell from your from datasheet with Mac at 29 and iPad at 46. These are tremendous numbers and as Luca said the September quarter was the all time high for Mac in the history of the company, and by not by little bit by $1.6 billion. And so it was a substantial difference that we did have aggressive promotion for college students that were going back to going back to school. And so that invariably part of it. But I think the other part of it during the remote work thing is not something that's going to snap back to the way it used to be anytime soon.
Operator: That will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
ChrisCaso: Yes, thank you. I guess first question is on iPhone pricing. And there was some changes in the iPhone price back this year, the iPhone, the price point for iPhone 12 moves up a bit, I guess the difference the gap between 12 and 12 Pro is smaller. And I guess that's after you made some adjustments years prior where the price point came down a bit? Can you talk through the thought process behind that and the potential implications for either unit out elasticity or blended ASP as a result of the price changes?
TimCook: Well, I the iPhone 12 family start at $699. In many places, because you can get in the deals that people are really paying are very different than that, because a lot of people, particularly in this country, but also in several other countries in the world connect to a carrier plan. And of course, those offers are much more aggressive. And so the price that our customers paying is probably the most important one. The iPhone 12 is at $799. And so I think what you're saying is there's a $200 difference there. But I would guess that people are viewing it more as a $300 difference between the 12 Mini and the 12 Pro. And so we'll see what the mix turns out. Right now we have no data other than 12 and 12. Pro, we like the data on the 12 Mini and the Pro Max, because we're not taking orders yet. But what we try to always do in pricing is give the customer a great value. And I feel like we really did that this year. And that's despite, as was mentioned earlier, all of the extra features that we placed into the phones, including 5G.
ChrisCaso: As a follow up you mentioned, some of the carrier incentives we've seen here in the US. And if you could provide some more color about that, about what you're seeing now. And obviously, as we went through, years ago, the incentive from carriers were a lot larger. Is this mark some shift in the approach of carriers as we're moving into 5G? What's the extent of the permanence of some of these incentives? And then, as 5G rolls out around the world and into other geographies, is this something we should expect that as either they try to protect from switchers or kind of promote the 5G networks will see a higher prevalence of incentives and carriers as we go forward?
TimCook: I don't want to speak for our carrier partners that would be up to them to talk about their plans. Generally, I think it's to the vast, vast majority of carriers around the world to their interest to move customers to 5G. And I think it's in the customer's interest to move to 5G and obviously, we like that as well. And so I think you have a situation where everyone's whoring in the same direction. And that's a very different kind of situation than normally we would have. And so it is one of the things as I alluded to earlier that makes me very bullish, only one, the other things are very important to the size of the install base, the product lineup, these things are critically important as well.

In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to re-classify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question
Operator: At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. . Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was – a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.
Justin Post: Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year we said that was a 40% – nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly on these – on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions. That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers – the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So – and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have – we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have – you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald V. Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had – customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically. We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Salmon: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our – we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May: Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say – have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're – it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers – for FBA sellers. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth?
Darin Manney: Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it – we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the – part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances. As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Colin Alan Sebastian: Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're – we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Devitt: Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term. And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see – you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks.
Darin Manney: Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to – it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail – the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
Greg Melich: Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few – you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing?
Greg Melich: And the sorting centers.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers.
Greg Melich: But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that – the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo.
Darin Manney: Thank you for joining us on our call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[0.020433850865833714, 0.04430653536347928];0.04430653536347928;0.020433850865833714;0
81;AMZN;2017-07-28;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead.
Darin Manney: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results to the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 27, 2017 only, and include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole Foods Market. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: At this time, we will open up the call for questions. We ask each caller please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3. Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those or in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could update us on that given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3. So, to give that some perspective, the Amazon-fulfilled network, or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year, and it's continued through this year. Last year we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went into service in the back end of last year. And that's what I mentioned about this time last year. The similar dynamic this year, we are going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year, so that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the video content. Video content last year, I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still – we lapped that most of the first half this year and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3, and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I will also point out that the strong usage growth in AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in capital leases to build the capital leases in the trailing 12 months. They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing – accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Colin Alan Sebastian: Great. Thank you. A question on the grocery category and the announcements that we have – that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they are very customer-centric, just like us. They've built a great business, focus around quality and customer. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh. And we'll see how customers respond. We like the response that we've seen so far. We think it's a valuable – all those are valuable services, Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality customer service to this offering.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Yes. A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well. And gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring. I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate. So we are adding – having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people were standing around the device table learning how they work, how they interact with devices. So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May: Thank you. A question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good. Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2 and if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with the second one. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide. So, nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers. What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year. It's a global number and we are very glad to have the success of the FBA program. We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy with the FBA program. It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides. So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly, on Prime, the value of a Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there. Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of annual Prime subscription? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the – we are increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption. Again, as I said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2, and also we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth. So, you're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30 databases over the last year-and-a-half. We signed some very big customer wins, like Ancestry, High Tail, California Polytechnic State University and others, that we're very proud to have. So, yes, the momentum in the business is very strong. We continue to open new regions. We'll be opening five regions in the near future in France, China, Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government cloud region in the East. So, yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that while pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation, the innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features. We also know the customers value our partner and customer ecosystem and really the experience we've had, we've been at this longer than anybody else.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: Hey. I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and I assume other expectations. So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion. And that is showing up in tech and content. On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up, and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those two as probably larger than normal impacts on Q2 operating margin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, as you continue to add more Prime Now markets with one to two-hour shipping, can you just talk to some of the logistical challenges that you've already encountered and worked through? And talk to kind of if you really do see one to two-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge you have to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue, it looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Could you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime? Or is there something else in there? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with your second question on the subscription revenue. It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1. So, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also – in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music. Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year. On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across eight countries. We do learn. It's something to do in every city and have different – slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go, learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love. That's not an inexpensive service, though, and we also have – so we're constantly working on our cost of delivery and our route densities. And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Daniel Salmon: Hey. Good afternoon, Brian. I think I heard you earlier say that your head count for advertising salespeople is growing faster than the company as a whole, or company's head count growth rate as a whole. I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople. And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show, with the screen on it, and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices with that one. Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yes. It's early on the Echo Show. As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability. So it's – I've used mine, it's awesome. It's a big step up in my mind, but we'll get more customer feedback as we go along. On advertising, technically what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular head count and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So, we built self-service tools and obviously we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize that we will need actual sales contact with the accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split, really, but I would see both growing.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two. One, with respect to international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of rank order or color, whether it be geographies or category expansion that we should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the international side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, stock-based comps stepped up a lot, both quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that was driving that step-up in stock-based compensation. Thank so much.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. I'll start with the second one. Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step-up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a head count increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step-up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RCU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also – it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2. On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international. Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along in the Prime, excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve. And so in some respects we are giving benefits earlier in the lifecycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later. And there's also India, as I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India and we see great momentum and success there, so we continue to invest and we have some of our best people in that business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Brian P. Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. You mentioned before just stand of new fulfillment centers, it takes a bit of time for them to ramp optimization. How should we think about that path optimization over a year or so? As you continue to scale operations and you bring data to bear and robotics and Kivas and AI machine learning, are you finding that kind of new fulfillment center optimization curve is accelerating?
Darin Manney: Hi, Brian. This is Darin. Yes. We're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up to three years or three peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility, and that's about the same although the whole network gets sufficient over time. So there's a big mix going on, and we like the new innovation that we're bringing to the capabilities, but that ramp still stays about consistent as it was.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from line of from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks for taking my question. Just one, other slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53% year-over-year. Anything to call out? And then just you made a comment about physical stores and reaction to one other question that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it fair to say that probably means locations would have small footprints versus large footprints if you're thinking about that? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: I'm sorry. What was the first part of your question?
Jason Helfstein: The other, other revenue slowed from 58% in the first quarter to 53%. Is there anything to call out around that?
Brian T. Olsavsky: No, nothing in that other line item. It's advertising and also other things like cobranded credit card agreements. I would say that advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past three quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things in it that more the variance and the volatility is in the other line items. Your question on stores, we are – again, I personally think the new devices, the ability to see new devices is a great asset, but I don't want to shortchange the rest of the bookstore and the ability to have curated selection and the creativity we've had in taking new look at the bookstores. So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer. So, we haven't essentially nailed the model yet, and we continue to experiment to see what works and how it differs by city or more suburban locations.
Darin Manney: So thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website through at least the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.";[0.1497165176249049, 0.07697189134543536];0.07697189134543536;0.1497165176249049;1
82;AMZN;2017-10-27;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments in response to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2017 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe, today, to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: At this time, we will open up the call for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration, how you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past. Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past? Thank you.
Dave Fildes: Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18). That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there. The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods. What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece. We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred. So that's, I think, one of a number of factors. So, there's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So, that's part of what you're seeing.
Brian T. Olsavsky: And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August. What you see in the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income. And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing up. In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically selects an item in a store. So, it will also include, or does include our Amazon Books. But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future. We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores. So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: Great. I guess I'll ask two as well. The first one is that was a bit of unusual upside to your guidance, even stripping out Whole Foods. What most surprised you in the quarter? You have been pretty consistent on how you reported versus your guide, so something unusual happened or somewhat unusual happened, what would you attribute that to?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. In Q3, yes, I would say we had a very strong Prime Day. As you know, we talked about that on the last call. But it really carried into the quarter. We had a record day for sign-ups for free trials for Prime in Prime Day globally, had a very strong Prime Day in particular internationally. So, it really got a lot more traction in this, the third year that we've had it. So I would point mostly to those factors. It was also a very strong quarter for AWS. Revenue growth was the same as Q2, and now we're at an $18 billion run rate, whereas last quarter when I had this call, we were at $16 billion, so very pleased with the customer response in the AWS business as well. And usage growth is actually growing a lot higher than revenue growth. So particularly pleased with the new customers that we've added and the additional workloads that we've picked up from existing customers.
Mark Mahaney: And then, briefly, on the international retail, that growth also by itself was intrinsically stronger than you've seen in a while. Any particular markets, geographic markets, you would call out there?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah, I would – yeah, it was pretty strong across the board. We had the impact of Souq obviously, this quarter internationally and the Diwali holiday in India was a few days earlier, which maybe pushed some sales into Q3 versus Q4. But generally, it was the strength of Prime Day internationally, and it carried through the quarter, but generally, I would point to the increased selection. A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring. So again, I wouldn't point to anything other than the Prime Day pickup, but it was stronger than probably I anticipated.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Whole Foods again, I was wondering could you talk about one or two of the biggest surprises you've seen so far? And then maybe just the strategic opportunities you see of having a brick-and-mortar presence as you look to continue to grow your overall business. And the second one, on the subscription revenue, you accelerated to 59%. Could you just talk about which countries or which regions are driving that? And maybe talk a little bit about the growth or the cadence of what's happening in the U.S., your oldest market? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. On Whole Foods, I would say it is early. August 28 was the close date and what I can tell you is I have been in meetings with John Mackey and his team, and they are very like-minded with us, customer-obsessed, ready to work together to continue their mission and expand on their offerings that we can offer customers. The other things I mentioned, price reductions early on, selling their products on Amazon.com and also installing Amazon Lockers. I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer. So, that's kind of the early report on Whole Foods. So far so good, and we're thrilled to finally be working together after the summer of closing the deal. On subscription revenue, let me just remember your question there. We had essentially 59% growth, as you said, 600 basis points higher than Q2. In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there. The growth in Prime has been fairly consistent over the last recent quarters in Prime memberships, and as I said, we had the largest new sign-ups on Prime Day for the Prime program. The monthly program is gaining traction and is an attractive option for a lot of people. And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. In the comment in the release on seasonal workers, that looks roughly flat year-on-year. I wanted to know if you could understand a little bit more about the trajectory around the workers needed to fulfill seasonal holiday demand and what that might also mean for automation or efficiency benefits you're getting inside your fulfillment centers? Thanks so much.
Dave Fildes: Yes, Eric, this is Dave. I think we put out a release, I think, earlier this quarter talking about 120,000 operations folks to bring into our fulfillment centers this year. So, we're continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations. We talked earlier this year about expecting to see a greater than or – roughly or greater than 30% square footage growth in operations. So, we're certainly hiring to support that. More of these facilities do have Amazon Robotics and certainly that helps with the efficiencies there, but it requires a tremendous effort from a number of our folks as well, and so we'll continue to hire there.
Brian T. Olsavsky: While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter. That includes the impact of the Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions. Without those, without that head count, the base Amazon grew 47%, which is still up from 42% in Q2. So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays. We continued to hire a lot of software engineers. We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was hoping you could help us understand how, at this point, you're prioritizing expansion into new product categories. In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category. Can you just help us understand the approach in general to new categories and pharmacy in particular? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah, I can't confirm or deny any of the rumors related to pharmacy or anything else. I will say we do see a lot of opportunity with Whole Foods. As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores. So, there will be a lot of integration, a lot of touch points and a lot of working together as we go forward. And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods. Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, and the opportunity that that technology presents. We have on campus bookstores. So, we are experimenting with a lot of formats. I think that Whole Foods really gives us a vast headstart on that and a great base. And a great team to work with who has a lot of history and a lot of – they probably have 10 years to 20 years of learnings that we don't have and wouldn't have. So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Great. Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May: Thank you. The other category which includes advertising accelerated 58% in the quarter. I think the common view there is that that's a fairly high margin business, certainly higher than corporate average. Is there any reason why that isn't the right assumption to make? Essentially what impact is the growth in the ad business having on the company's overall profitability? And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the revenue. So you're right, other revenue grew 58% in the quarter. And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements. Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there. But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business. Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices. We'll also provide – and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive. And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers. So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products. On the international, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits. And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members join in India than in any other country in the first 12 months. We have free shipping on 10 million items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon Family. We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India. So, a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India, very pleased with that. We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India. So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base. But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh. In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers. So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers. So, there's a lot of different influences there. You saw the growth rate. We believe that it's resonating with customers. So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Sandler: Hey, guys. Two questions. There's been some news flow recently about Brazil expansion. Can you just talk about how Brazil compares to maybe some of the other international markets that you're investing in? What level of investment should we expect in Brazil maybe relative to like in Australia or in India? And then a follow-up on the Whole Foods, so do you feel like the store footprint at 460 odd scores is adequate? Or any color on plans to expand either the Whole Foods store footprint or the Amazon Books stores or those other ones you mentioned? Thank you.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, Ross. Thanks for the question. This is Dave. On Brazil, just briefly, yeah we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and e-books offering without the sort of physical categories and, more recently, added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. So, I think, we're excited about the electronics getting out there. There is a wide variety of products included in that category: smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So, I think, we're really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, we really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.
Brian T. Olsavsky: And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin. So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce what that will look like and we are working with the Whole Foods team on how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early, so those plans will develop over time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: Great. Thanks, Brian. I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets. And then to the extent that we're thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and, obviously, have about an 800-basis-point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those two things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year?
Dave Fildes: Yeah, Heath. This is Dave. I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work in that, I think, is on the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now, and so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they are hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies, I mean, there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that. And so, I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses multi-user accounts, improving approval workflow tools and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime Shipping, which we think will be a great way for businesses to use multiuser – business customers have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and Germany. So, I think it's part of that offering, and we will really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we are focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts timed about around December 1 of last year. That certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts but new products that have lower average cost and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is in December or the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Scott William Devitt: Hi. Thanks. I had two, please. First, Prime Now, Fresh, Prime Pantry, and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected. And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those four as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint. And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with video. And I just want to be clear. We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018. And why are we going to do that? It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon. And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections. So we always do that. We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base, and things they want to see. So that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects at the back-end of this year and also lined up into next year. On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap. Yes. So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases combine them. We're not sure how it'll play out. But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipments. So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers and we're going to continue to work on those.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. I'll actually ask two, if I can. Just any way you can comment on the increase in Whole Foods traffic after the close? And then second, talk about your desire to have an ad supported business on Fire TV or through Prime Video? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Let me start on traffic. So we're not disclosing traffic figures. Whole Foods will be issuing a final 10-K early next month. So you'll see a better perspective on the entire quarter. The quarter that, or the four week period that you see running through the Amazon P&L this quarter is pretty hard to draw conclusions on other than revenue at this point. But Dave, do you have more on the...?
Dave Fildes: Yeah, Jason, this is Dave. On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free. There may be instances where you're viewing a first episode and there's an ad leading into that if it's the first free episode, but generally we like to have that as customers have paid into that program and they'll be able to enjoy that without interruption.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Ronald V. Josey: Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment. Is this a result of, or the thesis that more options could drive obviously more sales on the flip side, do you think you're losing sales by not having those options? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Probably a little of both. We think that especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. I think that's right. In terms of overall investments there.
Brian T. Olsavsky: And the other investments obviously are on the -maybe on the bigger-ish things or like planes and transportation capacity in general. There our philosophy is, again, we are going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays. By investing in those transportation options, we do so at same cost or cost parity I would say at the very minimum. But it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cut off times for customers. It enables Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 PM in the afternoon to midnight. Has huge benefits for both the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales and it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon is going to be there for you. And I need to remind you that the Thursday Night Football Game will start in two hours and 20 minutes, so...
Dave Fildes: On that, thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[0.24063897541810575, 0.07837106551576878];0.07837106551576878;0.24063897541810575;1
83;AMZN;2018-02-02;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney: I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company on noteworthy North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26 -- 36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy. So it's a very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017. If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off the similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value -- the offering's more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America, although not in the North America segment. I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance. Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years, and this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth: Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. There things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also, how you think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I will be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and the growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response with continued geographic expansion and continuing to again build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would -- that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well. Prime Now -- excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits, we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've increased rapidly, we're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000 plus smarthome devices from 1,200 unique brands. So that -- the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of -- excuse me, Alexa with our devices. Obviously Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets and we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things that I would point to. And that is an area again where we'll continue to invest heavily, and as you say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is -- fulfillment capacity, especially the fuel strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled the units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate. We expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018. Video content, we spoke about on the last call. We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'd be really -- I'd incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler: Hey guys, just two questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter. Can you just give us some color on what are the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that last one. Yes, the shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. There are now over 100 million items in the U.S. So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth -- usage growth continues to be strong growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate, and customers continued to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost error -- excuse me, price decrease last year, but we're very happy with the performance in the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Mark May: Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in the recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15, previously.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion. Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4 obviously, but a lot of the cost remain from the year-over-year build up in cost, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's -- given the 30% plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's 1 major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. That's probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.
Dave Fildes: This is Dave. Just on the second piece on pricing. I think on the pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS, I mean periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business where reduced prices more than 60x with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers, and some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and future launches, better options for customer that -- customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Daniel Salmon: First, Brian, any comments on the impact of ASC 606 accounting changes on your first quarter guidance here? And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, you have line search product sponsored ads, do you aim for certain particular ad load across the entire platform? Do you look at sort of tailoring it based on users activity, maybe a combination of both? I would just be interested in your thoughts on that.
Dave Fildes: Yes, this is Dave. I'll take the first part of that question just around the new revenue recognition standard. We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up. There are -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter. It's not material. There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us. But again, not material in the aggregate.
Brian Olsavsky: And on advertising, I would say our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process. We want customers to be able to see new brands and have easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers. So we're working with advertisers of all types and sizes to help them reach our customer base and the goal of driving brand awareness, discovery and better purchase decisions by the customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post: I think I have two questions. First, your Whole Foods, you've got over a quarter under your belt. How's it going versus your expectations? And what can Amazon really bring now that you've been there for a while, how are you thinking about that? And then secondly, your international decelerated a little bit this quarter, just wondering if there was any country to call out or anything going on there? And we know that you spent about $3 billion on International investment, I guess, last year. Where do you think the high watermark is on that? So just maybe a little more color on your international about business.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together. In our physical stores, it feels there are supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So, so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year. We've also added Lockers, and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin. Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life, and a lot of that is forward frontloaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years, and then it reverse later. So excluding this noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point. 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales. Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers. In India, India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year. In fact, more Prime members joined India's Prime program in the first year than we've seen in any other country in the history of the world, our world. So the selection is also increasing Prime eligible selection is up over 25 million items, launching Video there and also continuing to add other Prime benefits such as Prime Music will be coming soon, Amazon Family is there, as I said, Prime Video, and we had our first Prime Day in India. So that's a little bit on international growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak: I have two. First one, in the press release, you talked about the strength of the Prime member growth in 2017. Could you talk a little bit about to the -- what you're seeing in growth in Prime subscribers in the United States at this point? And are you still seeing a similar tick up in consumer spending as they come into Prime as you have in the past? And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business. I'd be curious to hear about your investment needed to go into logistics, health care and kind of new areas you haven't really cracked into as hard yet.
Dave Fildes: Yes, this is Dave, thanks for the answer the question, Brian. Just on the first piece, in terms of just Prime membership and Prime behavior, we continue to see that we're seeing sign-ups from memberships at a strong clip. When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in. We continue to see that as Prime members sign up and engage into the program, their purchasing patterns of change and they do spend more as they move into the program. And of course, our focus is -- continues to be on adding some of the features around Prime that Brian's been talking about, but also importantly, making sure we're adding more selection to the offering through our own efforts, first party, but also programs like Fulfillment by Amazon, which continues to be a fast grower for us.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing. I've said logistics, we will continue to build our logistics capability both -- and that will be all the way to end delivery. We've been able to increase service levels in many cases by delivering ourselves. And although we have a strong partner network here, we will always be able to leverage our strength and our knowledge about where shipments are going, both within our network and to final customers that will create opportunities for us there as we increase or better the customer experience as well. I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base. And to a lesser extent, versus grocery, I would say we continue to build our business, B2B businesses, and very happy with the initial performance there with a number of the companies and universities that we've been working with and their initial results.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
Scott Mushkin: Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole Foods. There's been a lot of press on the Whole Foods front, the out-of-stock issue and then clearly, in the Now, as we've been testing it, the Fresh has the same issue. So I was wondering if you guys could talk about what the company plans to do. I mean, there is obviously the reputational risk that could come from that to kind of correct some of these issues and kind of what the view of the company is on the out-of-stock issues. Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, let me just back it to a more general statement. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers. We've made no changes post acquisition that would have impacted anything related to in stock, except perhaps the fact that the price decreases have brought up demand and there's an amount of rebalancing related to that. So I think the out-of-stock issue is that -- may be getting press or tied more to the increased demand that we're seeing and also selective weather-related restocking issues. But stepping beyond any short-term issues, the commitment is -- remains to have healthy, high-quality selection in stock for products. That's what the Whole Foods team is committed to. That's what the Amazon team, with them, is committed to, and also across any delivery channel that we have, AmazonFresh, Prime Now or Whole Foods. So where there's issues, they'll be corrected. Where there's areas we can improve our selection and delivery for customers, we'll do so. But it be something we're working on. So the immediacy, the perishability are all challenges everyone has in this area, but we're confident that we will have a good service and continue to delight customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Youssef Squali: We've seen that the number of private label products on the site has increased pretty dramatically over the last 12 to 18 months. Could you speak to your private label strategy, in general? How big is that segment today? How big can it become? And just broadly speaking, how are the margins in that segment versus comparable third-party products?
Dave Fildes: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Dave. I think broadly, when we look at our strategy, it's focused on, number one, providing a broad selection for customers across a number of categories, so that they can find and buy exactly what they're looking for. When you look at private brands, it's very much meant to supplement that great selection, and we look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high-caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers and really supplement what vendors and sellers are already providing the customers in many cases. We've not broken out kind of how significant or how large that is. I think for a lot of these initiatives, when you look across categories that would offer, many of them are still earlier stage and have been around even from kind of infancy for shorter period of time, a year, a couple of years, in some cases. Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands and some of the more popular lines with customers things like Good Threads, Amazon's Essentials, which is men's and women's basics; consumables, is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and [indiscernible] Prime and others. So I think we'll continue to iterate on those and try to find different areas. And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.
Kenneth Sena: Maybe if you could just remind us of the thinking that behind keeping AWS and Retail under 1 corporate structure, and does it make sense given the scale of where AWS is right now? And then -- and I'm sorry if I have a little bit of an echo, I don't know why, but -- and we're hearing from marketers just how important Amazon is to their media strategy, so I don't know if you could just maybe talk about that a little bit more broadly in terms of the approach in your philosophy to that business.
Dave Fildes: Sure, we see a lot of value in all of our businesses. And AWS is a key component, as is the physical consumer business. The -- what I'll point out is, the management team is a common management team. The consumer business, if you will, is, if not the biggest, one of the largest customers of AWS. So we see a lot of commonality there where we, as depending on the position in the company, on the consumer side, the use of AWS is -- has driven great infrastructure efficiencies just like other companies see when they use AWS, turning fixed costs into variable costs and pooling resources and not having a lot of trapped capacity throughout the company and taking advantage of all the new services and features. So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, and sorry, Ken, your second question was?
Kenneth Sena: Yes, the second question was just on the advertising side. And we're just hearing so much more how important Amazon is to broader media budgets. And so just hoping to get maybe a little bit more color just on your approach to the business right now, some of the drivers behind the recent success and just maybe just more of a sort of, as you look out over the next few years, kind of how important do you see this business becoming in the grand scheme of things?
Dave Fildes: Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers. So I think there's more to come on that side. As we said, we're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues as part of the other revenue line item. And I think we're going to keep building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, I think we're also point of a key lien in from brands and agencies into the e-commerce marketing space. So it's other side, search or social marketing, it's really helping them engage customers on a high, efficient, highly efficient manner.
Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.";[0.04053941088038626, 0.07270214857453339];0.07270214857453339;0.04053941088038626;0
84;AMZN;2018-04-27;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business, sort of the state of conversations with advertisers? What product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of 2017 and into 2018 broadly for the platform? Thanks so much.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yes, sure, Eric. I would say advertising continues to be a bright spot both from a product standpoint and also financially. It continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the – in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers generally are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they all want to reach our customers generally to drive brand awareness, discovery and eventually purchase. Before I go into the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and One-Day options. And our Two-Day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S. annual plan from $99 to $119 for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price of Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And, Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, just wanted to remind folks that we mentioned this last quarter on the call. But on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies. So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of costs of sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is – the other revenue is, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex-FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter. Again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is – would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line item, just a few items of note. The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex-FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex-FX year-over-year. Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognized this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year. So in Q1 of this year, subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities, what can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S. and hopefully, New York soon?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans. There's also discounts for other groups. So, we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So, the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime – those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense, the accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S. business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer, you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. So first, with the – you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure. But the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime flywheel. So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So, not much more I can add by product line to North America. And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're – we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last two quarters. The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for – see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workflows to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as Aurora continues to grow at a very rapid clip. So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't. We have partner and ecosystem that others don't. And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May: Thank you. Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment, then you grow into that capacity. But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue? Thanks.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, Mark, this is Dave. On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there. As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised – or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%. But again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.
Brian T. Olsavsky: And on the question on capacity, – excuse me, cap – I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses. So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we get into bigger and bigger products. That's a representative number for that period. On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months. So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers. So have a couple things at play there that hopefully keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you had significant operating income upside in 1Q and I think a better outlook for the second quarter than many expected. Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide? And is there any reason to think that you couldn't see similar leverage in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, we came in well above our range that we had given of $300 million to $1 billion. I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top-line growth was – continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently. So customer adoption in AWS remained strong. And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on – with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially. We – at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high – relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilization. So we're still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see the reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably differential versus the guidance estimate. And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising. We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers. We'll have some costs in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So – and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So, I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with the customer reception we had in Q1 and then the income that, that drove.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. Great. Thanks. Two questions. The $239 million in other income, what was that? And then could you just wax a little bit eloquently hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what are – what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high profit, high margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute the consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that. And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow – that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me wax eloquently. Try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million; that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we partnered with. We have transportation companies that we partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of these companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with – on investments. It's also – there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive. On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly. Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then we want to let sellers for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are of all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully purchase. So, we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive. But you're right, there are always pressures in that. We will come down on the side of the customer. On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose not to do that right now.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL. We've done some things like the Prime Original Series All or Nothing; the third season's coming up soon, focused on the Dallas Cowboys. So that was one of our first forays in the live format that – one of the first forays in the live format where we had live ads and kind of, we're not only learning the technology, but learning to – learning that business. And I think we've been pleased with what we've seen so far obviously and look forward to the next few seasons with the NFL.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you. So I think, Brian, I had a question on your international shopping rollout, so I think this was recently announced. Where do you think you measure up versus some of the more local players where you might not have a direct presence in the country? And where do you think your value proposition lies? And presumably this is informed by users coming in from those regions where you don't really have an official site for people come in to buy stuff from you anyway. So, which regions or countries are accounting for most of the demand that you are seeing? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Stephen, are you're still on? Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically? Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe. So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Oh, on global store? Okay. Yes. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Yeah.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah. Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries. So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in – who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country. So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Yeah, thank you. I'd like to maybe dive into a couple of local recent overhangs. First, on shipping partners, just wondering how dependent are you on any shipping partner? And can you talk about any initiatives you've had to build out your own shipping network? I know in some countries that you might be over 50% of the stuff you're delivering. Could talk a little bit about dependency there? And then secondly, on taxes, can you remind us what happened when Amazon started collecting taxes on your own items in various states? And just kind of overview of your view on collecting third-party sales – taxes from third parties in other states if that were to pass? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with transportation. We have a great group of carriers that we use globally and you know who they are. But we're also growing our teams and capabilities to ensure that we can keep up with increased volume on our own, particularly around the holiday season. So that's driven a lot of our expansion of Amazon Logistics. It's driven the creation of sort centers. It's driven the purchase of airplanes to move product between points within our delivery network. So we will continue to operate with this combination of external partners and internal capability. We like what we see so far with our Amazon Logistics capability. It's well over 50% in some countries, particularly the UK. It helps with again Prime Now and AmazonFresh and a lot of initiatives that we'll see, which again we mentioned the Prime Now is tied in with Whole Foods, now in 10 cities. So we think it's a core competency that we have and we need to have, and we'll continue to invest in that.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, and Justin, this is Dave, just on the sales tax piece. Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax. On the 3T piece, we do collect on behalf of our sellers in two states, Washington State as of the first of this year, and then Pennsylvania turned on here on April 1. So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So yeah, nothing really more to add on that. I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitution and permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.
Gregory Scott Melich: Hi. Thanks. So I want to follow up on Prime a little bit. The fee increase, why now? I mean, we've been adding value for a long time, obviously shipping costs are going up. Why is now the right time to have that fee hike, especially since membership looks like the growth numbers are starting to slow? And tied into that, there's a lot of Alexa mentioning in the release. Could you give us some uptake on the importance of Alexa and basically voice commerce, and so the metrics you get in terms of usage there and the flywheel? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. We always evaluate the price of Prime in all the countries we're in, and we're looking for creative ways to reach the customer. As I mentioned earlier, creation – or excuse me, monthly plans, student plans, et cetera. So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefits it's delivering. I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days. Today you could get over 100 million products within two days, and many, many, many products within one day, same day or two hours. So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from...
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sorry go ahead.
Operator: Sorry go ahead. Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge: Great. Thank you. So the U.S. international revenue mix, ex-Whole Foods and ex-AWS looks about 64%, 36%. Given investments in the international markets would you envision international kind of closing the gap in the coming years? And what would be the key drivers of the mix shift getting closer to 50-50? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America. So when we add benefits, Prime benefits, we're probably adding them at an earlier stage of life in the Prime program internationally than we did in the U.S. So, they have different dynamics. We think at the end of the day customers behave the same globally and that they value low prices selection and great customer experience. So, we'll continue to make these investments in Prime. We'll continue to expand selection, continue to build FBA programs so that it increases selection even more and builds great partnerships with sellers. We'll continue to accelerate shipping. We'll continue to lower prices. And sorry, I cut out the last person [Technical Difficulty] (30:50-30:55) including Alexa, which we think has great stickiness with, in the home and I think creates a lot of value in the home and also allows you to access over time Amazon products better. We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers. And we like the momentum we've seen there. The Prime program started in the first year in India grew faster than any Prime program we've seen in other countries. We're adding local content in India, video content, excuse me. We're also adding other benefits, Prime benefits. We're rolling out devices there, and we're seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa, and Alexa is up, as you saw in the press release, to 40,000 [Technical Difficulty] (31:46-31:51). Yes, but it's – it is important to us that they all are still delighting customers and growing to the best of their ability.
Dave Fildes: Thanks Brian. And thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[0.04567600755093726, 0.029034393178950735];0.029034393178950735;0.04567600755093726;1
85;AMZN;2018-07-27;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead?
Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 26, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict the demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Great. Thank you. I guess, the standout metric of the quarter was the profitability and the margins. Both U.S. and International have improved year-over-year. Could you talk about (03:04) was it better than your expectations for the quarter? And then maybe reasons for the ad business to accelerate within the other line? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure, yeah. Thanks, Justin. Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter. We had – what I attribute it to is continued strength in our – some of our most profitable areas. AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth. Advertising also had strong growth. Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs. You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate. So that's what I would point to. Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold. I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year. Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently. We've launched devices in multiple countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in France. Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter. So continued – it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. Hey, maybe two things. Just a little bit of color on that unit growth, I think, it was 17%, any particular things to call out there as that would have stunted that growth or negatively limited? Or is that just kind of the new, new normal? And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business? Are there particular newfound efficiencies that are sustainable? Thanks a lot.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let's start with unit growth. So I will note, we did a very strong unit growth rate last year in Q2, with 27%, so we're comping against that. As we look back on that, there were number of factors. I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25. So there was a bit of growth, particularly in lower ASP items from that, that we saw last year. So we're comping that. Another factor is digital content that moves to subscription. So Amazon Music and Kindle Unlimited, while they're very successful and it's a good transition, they just – the units do not count in this unit calculation. So there's some things like that, that maybe obfuscate the numbers a bit, but we're really pleased with the retail growth. We think it's driven by again Prime, the Prime program, the engagement of Prime customers as well as increased selection, and particularly third-party selection. On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads. So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown – we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis. But 23% of that was in the second half of last year. So we are continuing to look at where we're investing head count. We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company. There's a lot of movement of tech head count. And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year. We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people. So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday. Last year, there was a lot of first half investment. If you look back on infrastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced. But this year it's a little more apparent.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask two, if I could. First, 3Q is typically a heavy fulfillment center build out period ahead of the holidays, and then lower utilization, but obviously your profit outlook is good. Can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about FC build out and square footage increases this year? And then, secondly a lot of excitement around the pharmacy opportunity with the acquisition of PillPack. Can you frame some of the strategic rationale there around the acquisition, and how that helps advance your efforts, and how we should think about integration going forward? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. On the fulfillment center capacity, I don't have a number for you, today. I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017. We anticipate it's going to be lower this year as we get some efficiencies off what we've built over the last few years, but I don't have a number for you today. I will say that, the majority of it is being put in service in the back-end of the year, just like in the last two years. But I'll – we'll clarify that next quarter. On PillPack, yes, the deal of course hasn't closed, yet. We expect to close it in the second half of the year, so I'll limit my comments right now. But we're excited. I think the company has a really highly differentiated customer experience, and they've done a great job getting to the size and scale that they're at today. We think that, working together with them we can expand on that in the future. They're like a lot of the other acquisitions we've done. Recently, we're looking for well-run companies with highly-differentiated customer experience, and a real sense of customer obsession that matches ours. So we think PillPack has got all those traits, and we look forward to the deal closing and working with them.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Mark A. May: Thanks. On AWS, does the backlog there give you confidence in the ability for this business to continue to post the type of robust growth that you've seen of late? And on Alexa, now that you're reaching a meaningful number of Alexa users, I wondered if you could discuss a bit more about how Alexa is impacting retail business?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, we're very happy with the results we're seeing, and the backlog that we see, and the new contracts and new customers and the expansion of existing customer business that we see. Again, the business has accelerated the last three quarters, and we're seeing great signs in a number of areas. We've added 800 new services and features so far this year; that's an accelerated pace from last year, which was a record year. We see customers have migrated more than 80,000 databases using the AWS Database Migration Service. And customers are just branching out to a lot of new products from us. There are new areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, serverless computing and database and analytics are really big. So we think that, when you look at it, why do people come to us? It's essentially set functionality and pace of innovation that we've demonstrated for multiple years. We've built a very strong partner and customer ecosystem. And frankly we've the most proven reliability of security and performance, and we've been at this longer than anyone else. So again, we continue to deliver for customers. We continue to use feedback from customers to develop new services and features. The operating margin itself will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, a very strong performance this quarter. Obviously, part of that was in the capital leases being flat year-over-year, and the team's ability to really run the data centers at a higher efficiency.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall. And – hey, this is Dave. I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those. We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there. So I think, that's a lot of – the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: Great. Thank you. Just on the AWS point, as you're seeing customers to AWS, you're adding new customers to AWS, can you give us a sense of sort of where you're seeing customers spend focus. How successful – you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow? And then, you flagged the flat capital lease growth on a year-over-year basis. In the past when you've talked about the growth in CapEx and capital lease, you generally referred to trying to grow those numbers or that infrastructure growth overall more or less with the business. Is there some level of efficiency breakthrough that you've gotten there where that's no longer the case? Or is it a function of timing? How should we think about what that CapEx and capital lease spend signals about your expectations for growth?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we – we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat. So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it. We do spend a lot of time driving better efficiency in our data centers. We do see it; sometimes it is higher than other quarters. The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very – that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in usage, which has been exceeding the revenue growth rate. But we can drive more efficiently and we can sometimes bank the efficiencies of prior investments that we've made in other periods. So it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I would say last year in the first half was a pretty large investment area. I'll lump it in with capital expenditures, but in the first two quarters, Q1 of last year, it was 82% growth year-over-year in capital expenditures, Q2 was 67%. This year, those numbers are 33% in Q1, and 1% in Q2. So it's a – there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks. I don't have on the other piece, on product detail, I don't have anything more for you. I would just say that, our growth is coming from customers that span from start-ups to enterprise customers to government agencies, and they start small and then they continue to build and shift their businesses to us, and many of them have gone – a large number have gone all-in on AWS, and have had a chance to lower their cost structures as a result. I'd count Amazon in that category, because on the consumer side of the business, we increasingly see infrastructure savings due to the conversion to AWS resources.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one on the ad business, Brian, I was just wondering, could you give us some examples of some products you've had particular success with on the ad side? And I know you guys are always focused on removing customer friction points and solving pain points for customers, maybe talk to us about some of the still existing pain points for your advertiser customers you're looking to address with the advertising product? And the second one, I know it's an accounting question, but we're going to be asked it a lot. On revenue accounting, can you just sort of walk us through any of the accounting changes that any of the revenue lines had in the current quarter because of the multiple accounting moving pieces? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising. So conceptually stepping back, it's now a multi-billion dollar business for us. We're seeing strong adoption across a number of fronts. Amazon vendors, sellers, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. So we have hundreds of thousands of emerging and established advertisers. And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to – whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site. Pain points and improvements, I would say, our priorities include improving the usability of our tools for advertisers, helping make smarter recommendations for customers. Automating, we're doing a lot of work on automating the activities that the advertisers need to do, and continue to invent new products for those advertisers. We also think measurement is going to be important so we're focused on our measurement capabilities, so advertisers understand what outcomes they're driving on our properties. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to show them the direct benefit of their advertising.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And Brian, this is Dave. Just on the accounting piece, specifically to Q2, the impact of the Accounting Standards Update, revenue recognition changes we did starting in the first part of year, it's a $640 million increase to other revenue, specifically related to how we treat some of the advertising service. So you remember as part of the adoption beginning in 2018, certainly the advertising services were classified as revenue rather than cost of sales. So $640 million more is in other revenue this second quarter. You'd see that in that line item, which is about $2.2 billion here in the second quarter. In addition to that, some of the other factors I talked about last quarter, some of the treatment of gross to net changes in some sales of apps and app content, digital media costs, some of that shift created a headwind for online stores revenue. So that year-over-year growth rate for that line item would have been higher, but for that change.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks so much. Two questions if I can. On Whole Foods, any update on the integration of Whole Foods within the broader Prime ecosystem, the way in which you're tying those assets and customer bases together to sort of promote the flywheel that you've talked about a fair bit? And Prime Now, any update on the scale of markets globally, and what you're learning as Prime Now continues to scale in terms of how users adopt the service, putting SKUs closer to prem what that does to the velocity of purchasing? Thank you so much.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime. We launched additional savings for Prime members at Whole Foods. If you go to Whole Foods store or Whole Foods Market 365 store, you see a lot of yellow stickers for 10% discounts of hundreds of sale items. You also see deep discounts on selected popular products. So Prime members have adopted this benefit, it's one of the fastest rates we've ever seen for a Prime benefit, and they've already saved millions of dollars on everything from seasonal favorites to as I said popular daily sales. So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's picking up steam. During the Prime Day, we had some unique deals for Prime customers at Whole Foods. Actually, the deals lasted for a week at Whole Foods. And people had, again the ability to see the benefit that Prime membership save incremental dollars, because of it at Whole Foods. And the Prime Rewards Visa Card, which gives you 5% off on all purchases has been applied to Whole Foods' purchases as well. So that is the second wave, probably after the first wave where we talked in previous calls about initial price drops, putting lockers in the stores, selling some of the Whole Foods' products on the Amazon site, and other things. So the invention level is still really high. We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops. Prime Now, I guess, my comments are that, it's in 50 cities worldwide, it's across 9 countries. It is different than – we have multiple options for you in grocery delivery. We have the delivery services – so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need. We have a traditional grocery store now with Whole Foods, and then we have the combination of those two with home delivery, and we're using Prime Now or Whole Foods products through Prime Now to make those deliveries as well as the new kind of stores with Amazon Go that we're experimenting with. So lots of innovation, invention on that front as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Sandler: Good evening. Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, and using the mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptake and converting users into paid members? Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin. If we look at International, it's still negative, but it's also improving pretty meaningfully, so can you parse where that improvement's coming from between India and the other emerging markets versus some of the more mature markets in Western Europe?
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure, let me start with that second question. So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America. But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India obviously, and have seen good traction there. We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary – celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue. But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin. But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that the – on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. So we're very bullish on our International business. We do realize it's a period of investment and we're in different stages of growth in different countries.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just quickly on Music, as you mentioned, tens of millions of paid customers are enjoying Amazon Music. When you look at the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription, it continues to grow very quickly. We've got those offerings in more than 30 countries now and the catalog there's tens of millions of songs, and a lot of rich playlists, personalized stations, those kinds of things. Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill. One of the great things that's also part of that, I think, you alluded to it is just Alexa, and one of the most popular features we see as you probably imagine for using those devices are just interacting with Alexa, wherever you may be is being able to listen to music. So that's proven to be a, I think, a good skill for folks to be able to enjoy in addition to a really kind of rich and growing Amazon skill set. We now have more than 45,000 skills available to customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.
Youssef Squali: Thank you very much. On the new Supreme Court decision, you guys have been collecting state taxes in all 45 states where it's applicable for a 1P. And for a 3P, I think, it was in two states. Have you seen any slowdown to growth in these two states since you began collecting taxes? I think, you started maybe last 12 months or so. When will you start collecting taxes in the rest of the country, and will you charge for it? Because my understanding is that, in those two states you do not collect or you do not charge to help these 3P sellers file taxes or collect state taxes. Thank you.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. Hey, Youssef this is Dave. So right now, as you mentioned 45 states that have state-imposed sales tax, first-party products we do our own collection on that. For 3P sellers right now, it's three states. So Washington State started as of January 1, Pennsylvania as of April 1, and most recently Oklahoma on July 1. So those are the ones where we're collecting and remitting. We haven't said – and to your second point we've not talked about any kind of trends. As you could imagine some of these are still really early days.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Given the focus in the press release about Alexa Voice Services, any thoughts about how you would monetize on third-party devices? And then just a follow up on Amazon Prime Video Channels, any plans to offer standard skinny bundles to become a cable replacement? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah, let me start with Alexa. So right now, our emphasis is around expanding the reach of Alexa and the usefulness. So as Dave mentioned, we're now up over 45,000 skills. We have a developer network of – that's expanded and we have over 13,000 smart home devices from 2,500 unique brands. You're seeing things like expansion into the hotel space where we're partnering with hotels to allow you to experience Alexa while you're traveling. And you saw from the quote that was in our press release from Jeff, the number of Alexa-enabled devices has tripled in the past year, so – including some really large companies like Polk, Sonos, Acer, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, BMW, Ford, Toyota to name a few. So that's the biggest emphasis, is getting the expansion of Alexa to places where it can be useful. We also are developing new machine learning tools to help developers more easily build Alexa skills. We feel like we're getting great traction there. So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, and then just on the second question. I mean, I can't speculate on what we might do in the future, but I'd say today, with Prime Channels, I think, we're really pleased with the growth we're seeing. We've seen some good channels come online over the last few quarters, and seen some good traction there. So we'll keep focusing on building out even better selection, because it's clear to us that customers want that option to be able to add that content as part of their Prime memberships.
Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Justin Post: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that. I know it's a tough 3Q comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years? What categories? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Thank you, Justin. Yeah, let me just remind you a couple of things from last year. We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content, not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you that the units – those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So, yeah, I would say essentially with that backdrop, we're still very, very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers on the consumer side. We have Amazon fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime eligible items that are available for FREE Two-Day Shipping for Prime members. And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.
Dave Fildes: And, Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on to that. You mentioned the online stores. Just a reminder, there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex-FX, to be higher than that, but for the adoption ad standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business. That seemed to slow down, I guess that whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would have led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there? Thanks a lot.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. On a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at two things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May. So the full pickup on that year-over-year was in 2017 and now we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple factors that hit the international growth area in particularly. But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup. Story is different country-by-country obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So, great first wave of the, what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which lead into Diwali.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Can you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of outperformance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And then any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with Q3 and this will be commentary pretty much on the whole year that was especially true in Q4. So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out. So, first on head count. If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole Foods we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles. So we're only up 13% on head count through nine months year-over-year. So a real step down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one, which is really significant, is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're also for our Amazon consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year. So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Please proceed.
Mark A. May: Thank you. Question on AWS. Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%, still quite strong, but dollar and percentage growth did slow. I'm just kind of curious are you just reaching a point in terms of a lot of large numbers where it will be more difficult to sustain not only accelerating growth, but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something also going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah, thanks for your question. This growth rate is going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. And we just mentioned on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration. Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to? Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious for your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies to think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods, it was purchased in August of last year and that has impacted every quarter since then, Q4 will be the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them since Q2 of last year. So if you, even factoring that, and we're looking at Q4 and we have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. And we'll just have to see how revenue comes in. I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may remember from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method. Previously, we had done it on a, is tilted more to Q4. It's based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call. This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is to scale it for you. Under the old methodology we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider. On the Robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now, continue to into our Robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.
Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking about that push in 2019 and 2020 and how that might open up new areas of wallet share for the company? Thanks guys.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. Yeah, I think we've started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods. We've also expanded grocery pickup and that's available in 10 cities. So the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can build your cart using Alexa and then check out using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omni-channel overlap, especially in the grocery business. On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. Amazon Go is now up to six stores. We opened five in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up a Amazon four-star location in New York City where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We of course have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer, wherever they happen to be.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.
Ross Sandler: Great. I guess two questions. Any color on, it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure? And then, the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation of fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about a 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it – any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Sure. I think it's comparable to – last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30%-plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing so that square footage may not be the main indicator, might be cubic feet, but if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the two. But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence and we negotiate hard and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our own shipping method. So, we don't see that as being a huge issue. On wages, of course, we did raise wages and starting November 1 just under 400,000 employees, both full-time and part-time in the U.S. and UK will be getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored – I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance and it will be obviously factored into guidance into 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
Youssef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there. And then there is some news, reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that, is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering? Thank you very much.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September. So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are. And right now our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. I think, I mean, we have no plans to build an ad-supported Prime Video offering for free at this time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier. You gave out the impact of ASC 606. And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide. So maybe if you can – is there a way to just kind of help us kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting kind of more value for your partners and customers and for yourself? Thanks.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line. So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now – up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party. It's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor, sequentially quarter-over-quarter is the gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Anthony DiClemente: Thanks very much. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad pricing in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in higher price per ad. And then what about the ad load? So are we kind of close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to get a sense for pricing and volume underneath advertising. And then also along the lines of advertising, heading into the holiday season, should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa commercialization, voice keyword ads let's say, and does that fit into your broader advertising growth strategy? Thanks.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah, let me talk a little bit more broadly about advertising. So yeah, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers for sure, authors, as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of and bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we're continuing to invent both on the product side, the tools side with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard, and invent new products for advertisers. If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, and this is Dave. Just jumping on the Alexa point, I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or two in terms of new announcements in devices out there. And I mean really looking at that, the goal is to make customers' lives easier and make it more convenient and a lot of that is you're seeing that in the homes and to some extent on the Go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you're seeing a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers. Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter. It's getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable and introducing a lot of really new cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Lloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for how much you guys feel like you're demand constrained versus supply constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and/or just provide the tools to advertisers and do you feel like there's more demand than you can satisfy? Any color you can share there?
Dave Fildes: Hey, this is Dave. I mean nothing specific. I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those. And so we spent a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful and customers making those purchase decisions. And so, we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand, and the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback is out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.
Colin Alan Sebastian: Great. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then, how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development? Thank you.
Brian T. Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign up data that we've seen. Since then, program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement, and a lot of our video content, music and shipping definitely as well as other Prime Benefits. We just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S., but in other countries. So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I mentioned earlier the linkage with Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up groceries from Whole Foods. Adding content, we have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here. Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs and pretty soon you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and also a couple other things, and hopefully you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home.
Dave Fildes: This is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean, just a reminder. When we look at this, our pricing philosophy has worked relentlessly, take cost out of our own cost structure and where we can pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford the lower prices and that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices 67 times since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those pre-OC price reductions are a normal part of our business for us.
Dave Fildes: (30:42) call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[0.14431709005232074, 0.08381264142524936];0.08381264142524936;0.14431709005232074;1
87;AMZN;2019-02-01;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2018 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post: Great. Thank you. I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how do you feel about the overall unit growth here, given that the growth was higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward? And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Take the subscription first.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. Hey, Justin, this is Dave. Just on the second question on the subscription services, we’d said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018. We’d said we'd anticipated about 300 million lower sort of headwind to subscription services revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. So you'll see that, we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you exclude FX. So the 300 million is certainly part of that decelerate -- the sequential deceleration in the growth rate in that line item.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number. So we don't focus as much on the number and we direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that breaks out the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter. We think it was a, Q4 in particular was a great quarter for customers that retail, there is a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses, the teams here had done a great job, planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers. We had a great Reinvent Conference in the quarter. So we feel good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue and income.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney: Thanks. Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business? Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue, just qualitatively or quantitatively, how that's doing? And third, if I could, you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter, it's a real step up. Do you just want to talk about the ROI that you think you're getting on that marketing spend?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. The first question is on India. Let me start with that. So we have incorporated into our guidance estimate, the best estimate we have for Q1 in India, however, there is much uncertainty as to what the impact of the government rule change is going to have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed to complying with all laws and regulations, we will, but we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers and sellers in India. We've built our business around price selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the sellers. Dave, why don’t you talk about the advertising growth?
Dave Fildes: Yeah, yeah. I think I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to help that customer set agencies, advertisers, make sure they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the things we've done more recently over the last few months or so is expanded sponsor brands, placements, some rolled out new campaign reports, so improved campaign manager features. So a number of -- there's a number of things beyond that, but features out there that are just going to, I think, make it easier for companies to grow with the ad tools and the ad services that we offer and we're continually excited about the opportunity there.
Brian Olsavsky: And then on your question of marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was up 110 basis points year-over-year. This category also includes AWS sales and marketing and keep that in mind, because that's where a lot of our headcount investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing. So variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior periods and we feel good about our return on investment on the marketing, the variable marketing.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Doug Anmuth: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on India, just bigger picture, Brian, do the new policies change your view at all of the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India and how do you think about your investment strategy there in the near term? And then also just hoping you could talk about some of the impact in the US and UK from free shipping during the fourth quarter holidays?
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Really, we're still evaluating the situation in India. We feel very good about the long term prospects in India and doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers. The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to be -- need to make sure they don't have unintended consequences. And again, I don't think it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection and better convenience for the Indian customer. So it's not all we can say on that topic right now.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And I think Doug, your second point was just around shipping, some of the shipping offers in the holiday. We did lower the free shipping threshold ahead in to the fourth quarter, so customers took advantage of that and that was a great offer for them in the holidays. Brian talked a little bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party side, but also sellers continuing to do well. As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of record breaking number of Alexa devices as well and I think just in that shipping vein, really pleased with the continued engagement from Prime members, we had the most ever number of Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So really pleased with that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Mark May: Thank you. When I try to back out the impact factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin expansion in the retail segment. Can you discuss what may have driven that and how to think about retail gross margins going forward? And then somewhat separately, retail margins last year benefited from several factors, including more modest hiring and more modest growth in fulfillment center capacity, do you see these factors persisting this year? Thanks.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. Thank you. Let me start with that last part, because I think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there are some clear trends regarding our cost structure. Starting with fulfillment costs, so in the prior two years, 2016, and 2017, we had grown our square footage tied to fulfilment and shipping by greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. Certainly, unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon Fulfilled demand were, we’ve combined FBA and retail, remained strong. So we had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years. Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe. Last year, we were at 14% growth. And so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018, while we still continue, in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales team to an AWS device area. So their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%. And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS business to support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017. So in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in 2016 and ’17. So while we'll continue to concurrently drive growth and customer offering and Prime benefits, we certainly do take costs seriously and we will continue to work on operational efficiencies. I would expect these investments to increase relative to 2018 and we've reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry: Great. Thank you. A little bit -- to dig a little bit deeper into the CapEx capital lease side of things, you guys have said in the past that generally you work to build in line with your expectations for guidance, so that you are trying not to over build or under build when thinking about your fulfilment in data center capacity. We saw that investment re-accelerate in the fourth quarter, after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first three quarters of last year.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. I see total CapEx that was -- grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, negative 1% in Q3 and then positive 17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So there was, as you say, a bit of investment in Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3. I still think the 17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the -- supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business. So I am not prepared to give you the forecast for the year right now. I would say that, I would consider 2018 to be a lighter investment year and the lighter year for adding fixed headcount certainly compared to 2016 and 2017 we'll reveal that as we go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what we expect in the first three months.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just -- the first one is to go back to the fourth quarter gross margins. I think if we try to back out AWS, it looks like there was a little more gross margin pressure. Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Sure. I’m sorry I skipped over that gross margin question earlier, but yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis points year-over-year, were not up as much as prior quarters. I would say the positive tailwinds still remain, AWS has strong growth of 46% on an FX neutral basis. Third party units continue to grow, advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the headwinds, I would say, were outbound shipping cost, including the free shipping that we did, but mostly, it was the higher Amazon fulfilled units and the greater use of Amazon logistics. And I would also say retail was very strong. We had a, as I think Dave mentioned, the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit globally, so devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We discussed how we don't price devices to make money. We usually will expand our content, expanding our device and usage. There are a group of customers who use our devices and then we monetize that in different ways to commitment to Amazon and the video and everything else. So a bit of it was mix, but I would say this retail, which has a lower gross margin more because of the revenue treatment was stronger in Q4.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And just on the other revenue piece, Brian, just to get back to the accounting side. We did adopt that revenue recognition standard in 2018 as I mentioned. As part of the adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue rather than a reduction of cost of sales. So specific to Q4, the impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion to other revenue, so you will see that in the other revenue in total.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian: Thanks. I guess two for me as well. In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the UK? And then marketplace fees are changing in several categories, including Home Furnishings, health and beauty, curious what the strategy is there, I assume to expand selection, but is it also an indication of an increasing focus on those retail categories? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with your second question. Obviously, third party sellers are an important part of our value proposition there. They’ve had great success on our site, the -- more than half of our units sold are from third party sellers. So it's very important to us that we have the right business profile, both for Amazon and for the sellers. So we will always be evolving that, part of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes, adding new fees or subtracting old ones, part of it involves raising or lowering fees that sellers pay. So you're going to see this continually from us. We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party. On the international, on an FX neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4. But last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of Diwali and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust for that and again Diwali had, took place primarily in Q4 this year and it was split between Q3 and Q4 last year. If we adjust for that, international growth is pretty flat Q3 to Q4.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Two if I can. First, just on the advertising side, we hear a lot of positive feedback from customers, but also we hear suggestions of their supply constraints. So, how do you guys see inventory growth versus pricing growth as a driver in that business and are there things you can do to grow inventory? And then secondly, there have been some reports, your Amazon shipping effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets. So wondering if you can give us a sense for what you've seen in this test markets and how you think about expanding your shipping efforts on that productized basis going forward? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Lloyd, thanks for the questions. I'll take the advertising piece first. I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools. I mean, our priorities in the space, that's certainly one of them looking for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands, automating activities, incenting new products and I think in all those regards in those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our own properties, but also potentially beyond, over the longer term, so, but even as we look for advertising opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of experimentation. I think we're learning and are a very data interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And on transportation, I assume you're just talking about our expansion of Amazon deliveries and Amazon logistics. Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak. So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs. So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One on the media side, has there been any step-up in terms of investments around media content to support your ambition with respect to Prime and the video. It's been a couple of years now since we got an update on rate of spend or how it might impact either historical periods or going forward periods, that would be number one. And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the advertising front, how do you think about the video opportunity, you're moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored products search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting with over the top video or connected TV opportunities [indiscernible] going forward. Thanks so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Let me start with video. We're not quantifying the Prime video spend today, but we do – it has been increasing. We expect it to increase even further in 2019. We're seeing a lot of again continued strong adoption and the usage and viewing and hours watched of our -- both our music and our seasoned video and music. And as a step back, it builds stronger Prime connectivity with our Prime members, at least, the higher membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And as we like, we see -- we continue to see that engagement growing. I would say that we've had some particular success in -- recently with 10 Golden Globe nominations and 3 Oscar nominations and Jack Ryan homecoming in season two of the [indiscernible] in particular, were very well received during the quarter.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And then on your second question, just around advertising opportunities and around video, you may have seen it not that long ago, IMDB or Internet Movie Database, one of our subsidiaries, launched FreeDive, which is an ad supported free streaming video channel that's available in the US and it enables customers to watch TV shows and movies without purchasing a subscription. So ad supported, so that's available on the IMDB website with your laptop or personal computer on. I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well is a great way to consume content. So I think excited about that, other opportunities we've been working with in ads, video for a bit longer period of time have been things like our sports offering, some of the live sports that we've done, things like Thursday Night Football, really like the success that we've seen on those and been learning from that and looking forward to pursuing more opportunities to engage and serve with customers with those types of video offers, but also take some opportunity to monetize with the advertising.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Just two, so just can you comment, did advertising slow down relative to third quarter. One, you kind of adjusting for 606 and then secondly, was there any reallocation in segments between online and physical stores and if not any commentary why physical stores was down year-over-year? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Thanks, Jason for your questions. Let me start with the physical stores revenues. So physical stores decreased 3% year-over-year and this is primarily Whole Foods, but also includes our other stores, the Amazon Books stores, Amazon Go, Amazon 4 star. What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a period last year when we – we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you remember of 2017. In Q4, we adjusted their fiscal calendar to link it up with Amazon's and it added about 5 days of revenue into Q4 of last year. So we're comping that year-over-year. The second piece is that, the -- as you said, the online orders where people go to the Prime Now app and then order for delivery or pick up at Whole Foods stores does count or is counted in the online stores component of revenues. So if you adjust for those, with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis was approximately 6%. Because of some of those, again, mostly the year-over-year accounting days, true up issue, it's showing up as negative 3% in physical stores.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some. So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I’d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon’s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Dan Salmon: Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, can we just return to your comment earlier about the increased use of Amazon logistics, not a surprise there, but just curious through the holiday season, any particular learnings that you can offer some color on and how you view the balance between using your own proprietary logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019? And then just a quick follow-up, obviously the HQ2 news came out during the quarter, what would you highlight as maybe the most important next steps there and maybe some color on the feedback from that process, I would be interested to hear that as well? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So let’s start with HQ2. Of course, in November, we announce we selected New York City and Northern Virginia and between the two cities, we will be investing $5 billion and creating more than 50000 jobs. We also announced a Operations Center of Excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about -- estimated to be about 5000 jobs. So right now, we're working through some next issues in both cities. We’re looking forward to investing in New York and Northern Virginia and being a good community partner as well as Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on that. On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of course, we have over 100 million items that customers would get within two days, but there's now over 3 million that will be delivered within one day or faster in 10,000 cities in town. So Amazon deliveries are a big part of that. Again, we have great third party partners as well in the transportation space. What we like about our ability to participate in transportation is that a lot of times, we can do it at the same cost or better and we like the cost profile of the two. We can also invest selectively because we have more perfect information we know where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between warehouses and sort centers and by not involving third parties all the time, we can find that we can extend our ship cut offs, or excuse me, our order cutoffs and we've done that over the last few years. So that's also another helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own logistics, excuse me, transportation final delivery.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler: So the AWS operating margins historically kind of move around a bit. Any color on what drove the decline sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And then I guess going back to the investment catch up theme, it sounds like 2019 will be a little bit more aggressive push from you guys. Can you parse out whether you expect the pace of retail margin expansion that we're seeing in North America right now, is that going to continue and most of these investments are going to be in international and some of the stuff going on in India and any color on the North America operating margin trajectory? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure. Let me start with the AWS operating margin, as you called it out. That number will move around, we're very pleased with the 29.3% that we saw during the quarter. Of course, at any point in time, this business is going to be a combination of lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build, especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead of our customers’ minds. And infrastructure, well again, it will balance between quarters a bit. Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than the prior three quarters. That had slight impact on the operating margin, but again year-over-year, operating margins were up and were almost 280 basis points. We've said quite openly that this is going to bounce around. What we do is to create great value for the customer on one end and then work to minimize our cost of infrastructure and we're getting more and more creative around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition down.
Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations site at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[-0.07861319674779288, -0.08606159427740967];-0.08606159427740967;-0.07861319674779288;1
88;AMZN;2019-04-26;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 25, 2019 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: At this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. You're now live.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. Hey, I'm going to ask two questions, because the first one is really simple. Unit growth of 10%, is this a meaningless metric, just talk through that number. I think it's the lowest unit growth I think we've ever seen, but just talk to us a little bit about that. And then international sales growth decelerated 16%, I know last - ex-FX. I know last quarter you talked about some challenges in the India market. Just give us some color, please, around that growth rate, how do we think about the sustainability of that? Was that negatively impacted by developments in India? Thanks a lot.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Mark. Thanks for your questions. I'd start on unit growth. So unit growth was 10%. Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited. And then, also it doesn't include Whole Foods Market. So while it is meaningful, it needs to be understood and caveated. So your question was on international growth. Yeah, talking more about specifically India, so India, for those of you on the call last quarter, we're just heading into an uncertain period with the PN2 ruling. We did make some changes to our structure to stay in compliance with all regulations. There were a few days of downtime for some of our selection. But for the full quarter the impact was minimal. And we're in compliance and very, very happy with the progress of the business in India. So as far as the growth is concerned in international, we had some noise in Q3 and Q4, if you'll remember with the timing of the Diwali holiday. But we feel pretty good about the Q1 growth there, even despite some downtime in India.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. You are now live.
Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I'll also ask two, if I can. Just first, Brian, can you just talk about the outperformance in operating income in 1Q? Increased significantly there, it looks like cost of sales and the fulfillment, but hoping you can provide some more color. And then why would the margin be materially lower in 2Q as you're guiding? And then just second, on the outlook for revenue in the second quarter on an FX-neutral basis, the higher end implies a nice acceleration, so curious what gives you the confidence in that. Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. Yeah, let's start with Q1. So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas. Things like fulfillment capacity, which have been growing over 30% a year in 2016 and 2017, dropped to 15% last year. Headcount growth was 48% in 2016, 38% if you exclude Whole Foods and Souq acquisitions in 2017. That dropped to 14% last year. And then, financial leases for infrastructure, which are good proxy for capital investment and infrastructure, after growing 69% in 2017, grew 10%. So all of those trailing 12-month metrics actually stayed the same or slightly declined in Q1. So we had continued efficiency. We didn't put a lot of new fulfillment center capacity or infrastructure into place at least compared to Q1 of last year. And hiring was moderate; we actually are down to 12% on a trailing 12-month basis. So I would say that is a continuation of last year. But my point from the last call still holds in that, we do expect those growth rates to be higher for all of 2019. So most of that will happen in the next three quarters, and we have that built into the Q2 guidance. We also hit the high-end of the revenue range, which is always good from an efficiency standpoint and the drop-through on the higher end of the revenue. So now turning into Q2, I would like to tell you a bit about why that's lower. So we have - we're currently working on evolving our Prime free Two-Day Shipping program to be a free One-Day Shipping program. We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us. For Q2 guidance, we've included approximately $800 million of incremental spend related to this investment. And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis. But this is all about the core free Two-Day offer morphing into - or evolving into a free One-Day offer. We've already started down this path. We've in the past months significantly expanded our one-day eligible selection and also expanded the number of zip codes eligible for one-day shipping. So we're taking a significant step. It wasn't showing up in Q1. It was minimal in Q1's results. It's a significant step and it will take us time to achieve. And we want to ensure that we have good delivery experience for our customers as we evolve this offer. And lastly, I would say in Q2, as a reminder, each year, we - Q2 is a time when we grant RSUs to employees. And we traditionally see a step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, and we're seeing the same thing this year.
Doug Anmuth: Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: And that - sorry, and that's also tied in with your question about revenue acceleration. We do believe that, although there's not explicit lift built in for the faster shipping, we have seen good order trends month to date. And we expect - we built the Q2 range about - around what we've seen.
Operator: Our next question is from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch. You are now live.
Justin Post: Great. Thank you. As users consume more services and maybe get less boxes, although I guess you could see a pickup in Q2, what does that mean for customer stickiness? How are you thinking about getting more advertising and getting more subscription services? And maybe you could just give us a little insight into what you're seeing with Prime churn especially in the more mature U.S. market? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure. Justin, I would say, as I said, I believe, on the last call, we had more people sign up for Prime in 2018 than any other year before. So we are very happy with the - not only the absolute membership levels of the Prime program, but also the engagement. Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky. So while I can't share - I wouldn't share with you today the Prime - any Prime - specific Prime statistics about churn, it does remain a very compelling program. I think, the announcement I just made about morphing to a one-day free shipping offer will make it even more the best deal in retail, as we say.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. You're now live.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4. Q4 was a fairly big step-down, when you strip out the accounting benefit or the last quarter, the accounting benefit. Can you talk a little bit about the supply and demand dynamics in the advertising business? How much of that will you might be controlling to making decisions about ad load versus the demand to advertise among sellers on the platform? And any color you could give us on what you might be seeing in the advertising business domestically versus internationally would be helpful. Thanks so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Yeah, we are seeing - as you can see in the operating margin, we're seeing a good advertising growth both in North America and also internationally. While I can't get into some of the questions about ad loads and inventory, I would say really what we're focused on right now is driving relevancy, ensuring that we service the most useful ad as possible. I think that's going to be the best experience for customers and also for advertisers. So most of our focus has been on again adding more functionality, adding more products and adding - reporting for businesses and advertisers, so they can understand the incremental customers they're seeing on Amazon through advertising with Amazon. So it's more right now about tools and making better recommendations, making it easier to use our Amazon demand-side platform, things like that, operational improvements. And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well. That's another theme that we have. These brand stores that we have are easy to create, customize, and we've had great pickup on that from brands, but they can show shoppers who they are and tell their story. So it builds a better engagement for the brand and the customer. It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon. And then on the brand side itself, we have new reporting - excuse me, where we're again looking to measure the new to the brand shoppers and what lift they're seeing. So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves. The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well. So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. You're now live.
Stephen Ju: I'm sure you can share in regards to the Prime users' awareness of the availability of stuff from Whole Foods. Is the order flow coming in from a wide number of users? Or is the activity coming in from a small, but very dedicated number of customers? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that we're very - it's widespread and more Prime members have adopted the Whole Foods benefit than almost any other benefit we've offered them, and they're saving, as a result, hundreds of millions of dollars. We continue to expand the coverage for delivery. We have delivery from 75 - into 75 U.S. metros through the Prime Now app, and we also have pickup in over 30 metros also through the Prime Now app. So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them. That shows up in our online stores classification. So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a similar number in Q1. So again, we're very happy with both the Prime adoption of the - or the recognition of the Prime benefits by - at Whole Foods, and also the purchases. And you may have also noticed that we lowered prices for the third major round of price cuts, since we joined forces with Whole Foods in the summer of 2017.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. You're now live.
Daniel Salmon: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe, Brian, just to return to the advertising business for a moment. It does sound like, as Eric noted, that there was a bit more of a slowdown again. I mean, I guess, I'll ask it this way. Do you believe that some of the improved relevance, some of the improved focus on brands as well as some of the new products can lead that business to reaccelerate at some point again? Or is it facing law of large numbers? And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve one-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that - in noting that it'll help contribute to the high-end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker. I would imagine, it's just simply expanding availability and that $800 million is largely related to shipping cost. But I just want to make sure, we're understanding that quickly that - this investment rolled out relatively quickly and starts to take effect relatively quickly.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. I'm glad you asked that. I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery. So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start. There is a certain tranche that we can dial up quickly, and we've started to do that and you'll see that very quickly in Q2. And then stay tuned, because we'll be building this - most of this capacity through the year in 2019. And then your question about advertising, I wouldn't comment on acceleration or deceleration of growth. I would just say, we're early on in this venture. There's a lot of - it's having a lot of pickup by both vendors, sellers and also authors. So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space.
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Evercore. You're now live.
Anthony DiClemente: Thanks very much. A couple of questions. In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast. So maybe just talk a little bit about that. Is this just law of large numbers as time goes by? What is Amazon doing to sort of sustain that growth rate in the third-party marketplace business? And then second question is maybe just quickly on media spend. Just update us on how you're thinking about the trajectory of video content spend. Any strategic changes there in terms of library versus originals versus films or TV content? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Let's step back on the third-party question. So again, let me reiterate our approach. So main goal here is that it will allow customers to have the broadest selection, the best available price and also the most convenient options on how they receive the item. If we're delivering on those three elements, we're indifferent as to whether it's sold by us or a third-party. We actively recruit sellers to sell on our platform, it's because it adds selection. It adds - if it's in the FBA program, it adds Prime eligible selection. We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully. So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers. Any growth acceleration or deceleration that you see can be very much tied to the total sales of the customer - that we have the customers in any country. So you'll still see the percentage of third-party units increased and has been steadily over the last few years. So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience. The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in one-day shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime eligible selection in our warehouses.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And then, Anthony, just real quick, this is Dave, on your question around media and probably more particularly the video strategy and what we're investing in, I mean, we are continuing to invest meaningfully in digital video. It's an area where we're very excited about. Lots of very popular, critically acclaimed shows have obviously come out, things like Homecoming, Jack Ryan, more recently Hanna, Guava Island, and some great titles. So I think look for us to continue to invest there. There was - on the accounting side, we did adopt an accounting standard in January that amended our accounting for how we cap for produced original video content. And under that new guidance, we capitalize production cost for original video content. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of those costs. So the net impact for the first quarter to operating income wasn't material. It was - for Q1, the impact of a change was a decrease of about $130 million to cost of sales due to the capitalization change. As we go through 2019, though, we would expect the impact to increase in the latter part of the second half of the year, in line with our production schedule as it grows throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question is from John Blackledge from Cowen and Company. You're now live.
John Blackledge: Great. Thanks. Just coming back to the Prime one-day delivery, will it be available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year? And I think you had about 100 million items available for two-day delivery, Prime delivery. As the one-day program starts, how many SKUs will be available? And would you expect to get the entire 100 million SKUs for one-day at some point? And then second question, just on grocery, just curious the upside for further expansion outside of kind of all the enhancements you're doing with Whole Foods. Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. So, yes, on the one-day free shipping versus the two-day free shipping, our goal is to evolve the two-day free shipping program into a one-day free shipping program and we're making strides on that. It got into a little bit about the capacity we have to add and changes we have to make to our supply chain in order to deliver on that. We expect to make steady progress quickly and through the year. We'll have more for you at the end of Q2 obviously. There's a lot of error bars around this program, especially from the cost side. We feel we're doing something very important for the customer. And we have - again trying to take advantage of the fulfillment capacity and transportation capacity especially with third-party partners that we have. And we'll just have to see what changes have to be made to get more and more selection into that one-day category.
Dave Fildes: And then, this is Dave again. Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out. We are also continuing to invest in our other grocery initiatives. Amazon Fresh, Prime Now, which offers grocery as one of the components of the selection there for the two-hour or even one-hour delivery capabilities. And so I think, we'll keep investing in those areas. I mean– and in other initiatives as well, where we can get food through Pantry, Go, there's a number of initiatives there. So excited about what we'll be able to continue to bring to customers on that space.
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Group. You're now live.
Ben Schachter: So more on the one-day shipping. Should we expect that to rely mostly on USPS, UPS or other shipping services or you're really going to try to build out more your Amazon owned and operated shipping? And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. Sure, Ben. I would say, we're going to be using all of the available levers that we have right now, both AMZL and also third-party carriers, and we'll just see how it develops going forward. But we're going to need definitely continued support of our external transportation partners. So outside of the ramp, I would say that the $800 million is what I have for you today. We will see where we stand at the end of the quarter, and I'll give you insight as to what we just saw and what our outlook is for future quarters at that time. I would like to - as I don't want to run out of time here. So I'm going to ask a question for myself about AWS, because I want to get some information to you. Most of the questions I can tell around one-day are topical and important. I do want to highlight the AWS performance in Q1. We're now over $30 billion annualized run rate, 42% FX-neutral growth and $2 billion more of revenue this Q1 versus last Q1. The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business. We're continuing to engage with many large customers globally. I'm particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. That's going to integrate more than 30,000 facilities and 1,500 suppliers and partners in Volkswagen's global supply chain over time. We have deals going with Ford on powering the cars of the future, Lyft, Gogo, a lot of really good customer wins in the quarter. And I think just more broadly, we're seeing continued momentum in enterprise migrations to AWS, and people are moving their workloads to AWS at a faster pace. Usage growth continues to be higher than revenue growth rates.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark May from Citi. You're now live.
Mark May: Thank you. And actually a follow-on to AWS, the growth clearly impressive, but we did see, I think sequentially, and I apologize I'm not in front of model, but I think the growth was somewhere at 3%, 4% sequentially. There was a little bit of a slowdown in the quarter. Just wondered if there's anything that you'd call out there, pricing or any other factors that you could call out, that may have contributed to that. And apologize, but another one-day shipping question here. In terms of the $800 million, just curious where that gets you to, in terms of coverage of zip codes and SKUs? I assume right now this is a project that's in the US. And where that gets you from a coverage standpoint? And is this something that you expect to be a near- to medium-term priority in some of your other developed markets like the UK, Germany, et cetera? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah. So I'm glad you asked that. So, Mark, it's - let me start with that second question. The program will be global. Most of the spend that we are seeing in Q2 is starting in North America. But this is intended to be a global improvement in speed tied to our Prime program. So you will see more going forward. I can't give you exact percentages of selection and all that, mainly because we are still again working through that. And while we have ratcheted up a significant - we turned the dial significantly in April. And so we'll see the cost impact almost immediately in the quarter. We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of one-day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter. I would say in the short run, it's also expanding and increasing our speed on all of our orders quite frankly. On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%. So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first-half of last year. This is always going to be a lumpy business. It's not only dependent on us, it's also dependent on the companies that are adopting Amazon, so there's a - or excuse me, AWS. So there are differences in sales cycles. There are differences in adoption of the cloud. There are differences in migration patterns that will make any quarter-to-quarter movements lumpy, as I said. So we're happy with the growth, 42% on an FX-neutral basis and again a $30 billion - greater than $30 billion annualized run rate.
Operator: Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. You are now live.
Heath Terry: Great, thanks. I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even the lowest rate ever. And you guys have said in the past that generally CapEx sort of tracks your - that you're investing at the level of growth that you expect. I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like. So just trying to understand sort of where the disconnect is there, and to the extent that your - the level of investment in physical infrastructures says anything about your expectations for future growth, what the right way to read that is?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for that question, Heath. No, I would say, A, we're not expecting diminished returns in any of our businesses or growth rates nor are we restraining the business or constraining the business in any way with our capital. I would point you back again to the investments that we made in 2016 and 2017. So we did front-load a lot of the investment both in fulfillment centers and also infrastructure. But more than that, it's more than kind of leading through excess capacity. We have some really, really impressive gains and efficiencies in both the warehouses and also the data centers. We talk efficiency. And every percentage utilization in our data centers is worth tens and more millions of dollars. So again, that's a big part of our model. It is not only investing, but also working on efficiencies, adding new products and features for customers. And as we lower costs, we pass those along to customers, either through new rates or new deals that we have. So I would say that I would look back on the performance in 2018 and say that that was great work with a - on a lot of efficiency as we also banked a lot of capacity that had been built previously. Moving forward, that's why I say it will be increasing as we move through the year. And that will be a constant battle between, again, growth, geographic expansion in AWS and also efficiencies to limit how much we actually need. I think we're also getting much better at adding capacity faster, so there's less need to build it 6 to 12 months in advance, I would say. Although, we did just launched our Hong Kong region today as well and I want to point that out. The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there. And, launching the Hong Kong region gets us to a footprint of 19 cities in China. So it continues to be a really good story for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. You are now live.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I'll go to a new topic, one-day shipping. So Amazon, the first principle is customer obsession. And, Brian, you talked about record Prime sub-growth last year. I guess the question is what are the signals or the key strategic rationale behind investing in one-day? Are there certain types of users, demographics of users, categories of products, countries you think this will help you attract and retain? It seems like Prime is growing pretty well. Just talk us through what you see as the big opportunity to invest in one-day? And then the second one, just maybe talk to us a little bit about the early learnings on the healthcare industry side of potentially trying to move larger into healthcare? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Great. Yeah, Brian, I would say it's as simple as price selection and convenience, which is the mantra that we talk about quite often. By going to one-day, it increases the convenience and it increases the available selection into the consideration set. Although, we have many items that are available in one to two hours, and also same day, the vast majority of our selection is available to you in two days. If we get that to one-day, we literally cut it in half, that's tough math for you. I'm sorry to do that. But the - we think that that will open up a lot of potential purchases that - and it will open up convenience to those customers. So we've been experimenting on a lot of different formats as you know, two-day, one-day, same-day, two-hour, stores, there's all types of - points of being there for the customer, when they need us at different points in their consideration set. So we really think it's going to be groundbreaking for Prime customers. And we're very excited to add this capability. And, again, part of this is we have the capability, because we've been at this for over 20 years and continue to invest in our fulfillment capacity, our logistics capacity and also fine-tune it. But I thank you for your question.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, Brian, and this is Dave. Just briefly on healthcare, I mean, that term can touch upon any number of different parts of our businesses. Of course, we've talked in the past about how Amazon Business serves many other companies, including the healthcare industry and providing them some great selection. And fast delivery is part of that - the business program there. So - and that continues to do well and it's a focus of Amazon Business amongst other verticals there that they serve. PillPack, we're probably around 6 months or so in since that acquisition closed, and continuing to support them in their mission and learn from them certainly. So no real update on that, but excited about the potential there to be sure. Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[-0.014179183493694736, 0.03848210327393886];0.03848210327393886;-0.014179183493694736;0
89;AMZN;2019-07-25;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer:
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will now open the call up for questions.  Our first question is coming from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Brian Nowak: I have two. It looks like the overall retail business accelerated pretty nicely in the quarter. Maybe could you just talk about whether 24-hour shipping is in that? So which specific categories of consumption are you seeing really drive that acceleration? And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Thanks for your questions. Let me start with AWS. We feel this really strong quarter. We had a growth year-over-year in our run rate from $24 billion to $33 billion, so 37% growth. The $9 billion that we increased our run rate by was second only to Q4 of last year as far as our history. So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services. And continually again AWS is being chosen as a partner to many companies because of our leadership position both in technology, our vibrant partner ecosystem, and also the stronger security that we offer. On your question about one-day, let me update you on that, because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2. So we are really pleased with the customer response to our growing one-day offering. In Q2, we had a meaningful step up in the one-day shipments, primarily in North America. And volume -- one-day volume was accelerating throughout the quarter. The ops team did a fantastic job here, not only in being able to expand one-day selection and delivery capacity, but also preparing for and handling some very high volumes on Prime Day earlier in the month. So we're in the middle of the journey here. We expect to see continued ramp of the one-day selection availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international. International was up slightly in Q2, but for the most part, the improvement in delivery speeds will be in future quarters there. On the cost side, we talked last time about $800 million estimate of transportation cost to supply one day, the additional one day in Q2. We were a little bit higher than that number in total cost. We saw some additional transition costs in our warehouses. We saw some lower productivity as we were expanding rather quickly, both local capacity in the off-season also in our delivery networks. We also saw some costs were moving -- buying more inventory and moving inventory around in our network to have it be closer to customers. And we built that not only that cost structure, but an accelerating cost penalty into our Q3 guidance that was released with our earnings today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heath Terry: Great. Thanks. Just wondering back on the AWS side of things, can you give us a sense of sort of what you're seeing from a volume perspective? Obviously, price is always a big component of growth in this, but just trying to understand whether or not you're seeing similar trends in terms of growth rate deceleration on the volume side of things. And then to the extent that we're sort of thinking about the mix of either revenue or usage within that business. Are there any products or sort of product areas AI obviously being one that's been a major initiative for you that you're seeing particular either outside growth or under growth relative to the overall business that you would call out?
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. On that second point, I'd say we're seeing a lot of increased adoption and machine learning services especially Amazon Sage Maker. We've had tens of thousands of customers who are now using AWS machine learning services and we'll continue to innovate on behalf of those customers. We released more than 200 machine learning features and capabilities in 2018 alone in this area. Database is also a multibillion-dollar business propelled by Aurora. So we're seeing a lot of strength. We're seeing strong usage growth that outpaces revenue growth as usual increased pace of enterprise migrations. So, I would say that on a percentage growth basis again on a dollar basis, it's going very strongly. On a percentage growth basis, we are lapping some very strong growth in the first half of last year. We were growing about 50% in the first half of last year. There's some particular unique customer volumes that were flowing through that some customers have really high usage tied to their businesses. But for the most part, we continue to grow usage and our expansion of our services with all of our customers. So very happy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Justin Post: Great. Couple of questions. I guess, the first question is just happens with the customer behavior when they do have one-day availability? I'm assuming units go up, but can you give us any details on what happens or a category that switches to one-day what happens? And the second question, we've heard from some smaller checks that some of the smaller merchants are moving to 3P, not getting orders on the one piece side as much. Is there any change in your business there to really kind of focus more towards third-party from first-party? Thanks a lot.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. No, we don't have category specifics to really share with you today on the move to one-day. I did say that generally in Q2 the unit volume was greater than revenue volume. So we did see some lower ASPs. But I think what you're saying is just a lot more products enter the consideration set for our customers. So things that maybe they can't wait two days on, they can wait one day, and it lights up a whole separate usefulness for the Amazon site. I've noticed that personally myself that just -- with one-day shipments, it's here before you know it. So what categories that hits specifically, we'll have to see over time. On your comment, I assume you meant vendors not merchants, but on the move from 1P to 3P, but no there shouldn't be -- I can't highlight anything related shifting in channel there, but I would say that we remain in different on whether -- we're focused on price convenience and selection for our customers. And whether product is a retail offering or third-party offering is not that important to us. As long as it's in stock, as long as it's priced competitively. So, as you know our 3P selection has -- our 3P percent of units has been increasing over time and increased again in this quarter to 54% of units. We continue to invest very heavily in our systems both for retail vendors and also for third-party merchants invest billions of dollars a year on behalf of then making Amazon a better place for customers to buy and increasingly not only vendor sales, but also third-party merchant sales. In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses. So when we win, we win together with our vendor partners and also our seller partners.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. So in the release you made a comment about automotive and Alexa, anything you want to elaborate a little more that looks like that's a very interesting opportunity? And then with respect to India, there were two comments in the release, but anything you can comment on kind of getting past some of the issues that had impacted the business in the past? I know you're past that now. Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with India. So yes, continue to see growth in programs for both sellers -- for our sellers and delivery partners. In the last 18 months, we've doubled the number of paid Prime member, which we're very excited about. We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies around the world. We started Amazon Flex in India, which helps our local partners to deliver packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and increases our speed of delivery. So it's a win-win. We've also introduced package-free shipment program in nine cities. This is going to be a big part of our shipment zero program, a vision to make all Amazon shipment net carbon zero. On the government side, our engagement with the Indian government makes us optimistic about partnering and collaborating to seek a stable predicable policy that allow us to continue investing in our technology and infrastructure. And it also helps us to create jobs and scale local businesses. So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year. The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday. So, that's factored into our international – excuse me, our, revenue growth rate for the quarter.
Dave Fildes: Yes, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is really a more and more place. I think the point you're probably referencing is, we're now seeing hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built in. So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle. So we've seen a lot of good partnerships and arrangements with companies like BMW and Mini and not just in the U.S., but in places like Europe as well. So a lot of this of course is just around the great power of Alexa and being able to offer even greater convenience and touch points where customers can interact with that and we're seeing a lot of good momentum with usage and how customers are interacting with Alexa.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Please proceed.
Youssef Squali: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions for me please. Can you quantify the cost of one-day shipping to Q3 guidance kind of similarly to what you did into 4Q too with that $800 million? And if they plateau how should be thinking about it, as we map it out over the next several quarters? And then you guys made a very intriguing acquisition, the Sizmek acquisition sometime back. I'm just wondering, how does it fit in the overall strategy? And is the idea to try to build may be a double click like-minded model, sorry using that platform? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Hi, Youssef. Let me start your question on one-day. I'm not breaking out the specific cost this quarter as I did last year -- last quarter. Some of this is because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between one-day and other cost issues. So we're always working within a range. We're confidently we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2. And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out. We had a meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through the quarter. We'll see more cost in Q3. We'll see about Q4 when we talk and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance. So I wouldn't break out the dollar term. I will tell you at the end of the quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and how it looks for Q4 as well. And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters.
Dave Fildes: Yes. And then just on Sizmek quickly. We are excited to have acquired the Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO. Customers are going to be able to continue to use those proven products and services. We're invested in the long-term success of Sizmek. And again, Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base. So we're looking forward to work with that team and we'll share more updates as we invent and create new opportunities to serve advertisers in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Sir, your line is live.
Mark Mahaney: Sorry about that. Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity you're seeing -- you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of one-day? And I just -- the commentary in the press release about this acceleration from one-day, sounds great. It's a little surprising that you would see the reaction that quickly. But maybe this really is -- well you're obviously seeing it. You're confident you'll also see it as you roll out into international markets, if you could just comment on that? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. The -- of course the proportion of one-day shipments is higher in international to begin with in a lot of our countries. So we will -- we expect it to be very valuable to customers as we add selection into that one-day category. But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime. So yes, I would say, you're faced with the -- you see it every time you go to our site. It's automatically built in. You're surprised by the speed. It's not like you have to search one-day shipping specifically to find out what's available. It's growing and it's pervasive. So I think what that does is, again it strengthens your purchase decision, it strengthens the need to not have to go elsewhere to buy a product because you need it quickly. So I think it's becomes a part of your routine. At least that's what we're seeing in North America. And we hope again as we build this capacity to more and more regions and more and more ZIP codes and adding more and more selection that everyone will see the same thing that we see already in major cities. I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of one-day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are certainly going on here. If you look at Q2, our marketing expense was up 48% year-over-year and that's a combination of a few things. First, we're continuing to add our AWS sales and marketing teams. We see great opportunity there to help customers engage with our services and migrate to our products. So we continue to build out our sales force and our marketing programs. We're also adding more and more advertising as we roll out devices and Prime Video -- new Prime Video content in particular internationally. So we're seeing higher marketing costs. We're also seeing a higher stock-based compensation expense. That was up 36% year-over-year. And you'll see that our headcount grew 13% year-over-year. So when you look at some of our most quickly growing areas things like Alexa and AWS and also teams working on machine learning and other high-end technical projects, our technical headcount actually grew twice that rate or nearly twice that rate based on total headcount. So there's a lot of moving parts within our headcount number, but there's a very strong investment going on in AWS devices and videos in particular.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed.
Ross Sandler: Hey guys, just two questions. The North America retail acceleration was 3.5 points and you mentioned international is about one. So can we attribute the difference to one-day? Or was there other organic acceleration in North America happening aside from the move to one-day? And then Brian related to that investing question, AWS operating margin came down a bit. I know they had a tough comp. But anything you would call out aside from the headcount stuff that you just mentioned that may have been lumpy in the quarter on AWS? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with that second question. So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total. The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%. So we had that dynamic. Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2. So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%. So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2. But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses. Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international. But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that. If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members. But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Pleased proceed.
Mark May: Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. First I guess sort of an organizational question, but some of the feedback I've heard from the ecosystem is that it appears that the combination of the way Amazon's organized internally and just rapid growth in the ad business 1P, 3P that at times there are signs that kind of these teams internally are not always aligned and maybe that creates some issues. And just wonder first do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions that maybe in the past haven't always been organized internally that way? And then secondly in terms of subscription revenue where are we in terms of the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and rolled through to existing members throughout the last year and will this have any meaningful impacts in that lines growth say in Q3 of the back half of the year? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. So, I assume your first question is about the coordination of advertiser with teams that are interacting with vendors and sellers, perhaps is that what you meant?
Mark May: Exactly. Yes.
Brian Olsavsky: Okay. Yes, so, first, I'd say we're customer-focused first and primarily, but we need to have good coordination across our teams and we grow fast and we add new things. So, there's always learnings that we have that's why we say it's still day one here. But we're trying to minimize the negative impact on any vendor or seller out there. So, I can't comment on any certain -- on exactly what issues you might be talking about. We have teams dedicated to the seller experience and the vendor experience and we think they do a good job of selling the whole suite of products including advertising -- with the advertising teams at Amazon. But as you say they're separately run and they can meet at different points and sometimes at certain vendors perhaps that may get out of hand are get out of sync. But hopefully that is a temporary condition. On subscription revenue, yes, we -- you remember we raised the price of Prime in the U.S. last June from $99 to $119. So, the largest impact -- favorable impact from that at least from a subscription revenue standpoint would have happened in the subsequent four quarters, less in Q2, more in Q3 through Q2 of this year. So, yes, that will be a factor that we're comping for the next 12 months. Its offset by the growth in the Prime program itself and the expansion of Prime Benefits or the Prime program globally. You may see that -- may have seen we have launched Prime in United Arab Emirates this quarter. So, it's not something -- it's something we've certainly seen in the past with timing of price increases, but it's built into the Q3 guidance that I've given.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Colin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. I guess first up curious just a follow-up on the ASP comments if those were – if that shift within the same categories or just lower ASPs imply diversification into new categories. But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts and 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to one-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand and should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. So, I would say the first time we started discussing the rollout of one-day our first thoughts went to Q4 this year and our capability for holiday and as much as Q2 and Q3. So we are confident that we will have the ability to handle seasonal demand. We are working very hard to expand our one-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well. So we're feeling good about Q4. It's a little early to discuss that now, but we certainly had a really good test on Prime Day. It was the two biggest days we've ever had. A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well. So it was a good test for us. And, sorry, your question on low ASP, I think we're still figuring that out a bit. I mean they -- what I'm reacting to is the high unit growth relative to good growth in revenue, but unit growth grew faster. I'm always a little vary to put too much into the unit growth number. As I've talked in other quarters, it's a number that's excludes AWS subscription services, advertising and Whole Foods, which are some of the fastest growing areas and we also have – are actively selling subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited, which can cannibalize unit sales. So there's a lot of moving parts, usually our headwinds to our unit growth number, but again happy with the 800 basis point quarter-over-quarter jump in that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Brian just on the op income guide for the next quarter, it's significantly below where many of us are at. I'm curious if you could just talk to any changes around expenses and the success of one day just doubling down or can you just walk through what's transpires in the next quarter? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So again the biggest individual item is the one-day shipping. As I said earlier, we had a meaningful step up in shipments in Q2 versus Q1, but we're still on our way and Q3 will be a step up over Q2 in North America and we'll see more in international. So it's -- that increase in one-day shipping and all the associated cost of additional transportation and getting capacity in place. As I mentioned earlier new costs and things like expanding inventory, getting it closer to the customer. Just a lot of things moving -- a lot of moving parts in the fulfillment center world right now and our transport networks. So that is the biggest individual contributor but as I mentioned in Q2's results, some of the investments in marketing, the step up in infrastructure spending that should continue. We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh. So I would say, yes, we had -- as we've mentioned the last couple of calls, we had some lessening of expenses in some key areas last year, mostly tied to headcount growth, infrastructure and fulfillment capacity. We expected a step up in 2019. We didn't see as much of it in Q1, mainly because of the timing of the seasonality of the year and getting things going. We’re seeing more of it in Q2 and we'll see it through the remainder of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe a few small questions on the advertising side of the business if I can. How much of the advertising business would you be willing to say is driven by domestic sellers and domestic brands versus the international side? Two, how do you think about the video ad revenue opportunity? We continue to hear from a lot of people in the advertising industry that you might be a bigger player in video advertising later this year or more into next year, how do you think about making investments against that possibility or even just possibility of being a driver in your platform overall? Thanks so much for the color guys.
Dave Fildes: Yes, Eric this is Dave. I think started with the video advertising that one focus areas for us is expanding our video and over the top offerings for brands. We've taken some steps with live sports and then IMDb TV, but we'll continue to do things like add more OTT video supply, just things like Amazon Publisher service integrations and simplifying access for third-party apps and add more inventory through things like Fire TV apps and IMDb TV. So some interesting areas that we're continue to put a lot of focus into. Now the first part of your question, in terms of geographical mix, I mean, fair to assume that like a lot of our business, advertising in the North America segment is the bigger piece of that, but I think we're really excited about the international opportunity. A lot of the tools that we've rolled out introduced in places like the United States aren't available in many of the international regions. And so, it's a matter of continuing to work with advertisers and brands and kind of buildup, not only awareness but just how those -- add things like sponsored products interact with customers and how they receive -- building up the things we talk about many times here around improving relevancy on each of those geographic websites is an important thing that we're measuring. So, expected to continue see us look for new ways to be able to roll that out.
Dave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[0.023474701269111886, 0.04153492678977];0.04153492678977;0.023474701269111886;0
90;AMZN;2019-10-24;"Company Representatives: Brian Olsavsky - Chief Financial Officer  Dave Fildes - Director of Investor Relations Shelly Kay Pfeiffer - Director of Investor Relations 
Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com, Q3 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q3, 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.  As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, October 24, 2019 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we’ve seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.
Operator: Thank you. . Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to know if I could go a little bit deeper in the framework you gave around revenue guidance for Q4.  Historically, you have seen deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate in Q4 versus Q3, but many of your businesses look like they reaccelerated in Q3 over Q2. So just wanted to know whether it was AWS or advertising or some of the things in e-commerce business, whether there are things we should be keeping in front of mind from a headwind or a tailwind perspective, as we think through some of the moving pieces in Q4? Thanks so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Hi, Eric. Yes, let me make clear, we are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season. We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our One Day shipping. The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that’s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4.  On the guidance front, here’s what I would have you keep in mind. If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years.  There has been a noticeable drop in run rate, between Q3 and Q4 generally on the lines of about 300 basis points. We are factoring that in this year, that’s just something we’re expecting. It’s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that’s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year.  So we factor that in, and then there’s also two other issues. The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year. Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we’ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan.  So if you wrap those together, we expect it’s going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate. I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.  For the company, it’s not as large an issue. There is about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it’s expected to be about 80 basis point headwind in Q4. So that’s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4.  I think we’re well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers. I think One Day should help with holiday shipping. We’ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we’re looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as you’ve been increasing availability? 
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start with the second part of that. So back in Q2, I said that we were estimating an $800 million expense tied to One Day in Q2, and we actually were just above that in Q2. In Q3, we expected that to grow, we put into our guidance and we hit essentially where we expected on the guidance.  So as we head into Q4, we’ve added what’s just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for deploying inventory closer to customers, there’s a lot of tangential costs, by and a way the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.  So we’ve built that into our Q4 guidance estimate, but we’re very pleased with the customer response to One Day. You can see it in our revenue acceleration and also in our unit growth acceleration. Once again the ops team has really done yeoman’s work here to create this capacity for us and they continue to unlock additional capacity daily.  We’re expecting that it will be again a great help to customers in Q4. We have seen Prime members increase their orders, spend more, so that they must also see it as a real help to them in their daily lives.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
Youssef Squali: Great, thank you so much. Brian, kind of just a couple of quick ones. Of the 400 basis point sequential acceleration growth, can you help us just understand maybe how much of that was driven by Prime Day, which I think you guys said was a record day for you versus One Day shipping. Just trying to extract one versus the other, because obviously going into Q4 you’re only going to have the latter.  And then on – a lot of news around counterfeit and whatnot on the side. Can you just help quantify that for us if there is a way for you to do that? And is the higher OpEx 4Q also driven at least in part by the higher investment to combat that? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. So on the second one, I would say we’re certainly very diligent on trying to catch counterfeit products. We put a lot of effort into that, we put a lot of human effort, we put a lot of machine learning and algorithmic effort into that as well. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the One Day costs, I appreciate the color. I’m curious to hear about how you think about what portion of these costs are sort of transitory versus structurally? It sounds like there are some shipping costs in there.  Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the next one to two years to get the One Day shipping costs closer to what they used to be for Two Day, and how do you think about how long it’s going to take?  And then secondly on One Day, I think it’s mostly U.S. to-date, is that right? And then if not, how do you think about sort of timing on pushing more internationally? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Yes, most of the expense has been in the U.S., but we have also increased our One Day selection internationally. We’re starting to see some benefits from that. But I would say the biggest impact so far, both on the top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heath Terry: Great, thanks. I know most of the focus on One Day has been on speed, but based on the vans we’re all seeing, it would seem that the shift to more of your own last mile infrastructure is maybe the bigger part of this.  As it scales and you get to higher levels of efficiency and utilization, does that become margin accretive or profitability accretive relative to using the third parties almost exclusively in the way that you have in the past? And then this was also a very big hiring quarter for you, 100,000 people. Can you give us a sense of where those people are going you know relative to AWS fulfillment, retail, kind of understanding sort of where they have been prioritized?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you for your questions Heath. On the first question, I think it boils down to whether it will be competitive long term with other options out there. Yes, we will be, we believe that. In many cases we are already are and the places where we have very high AMZL percentages, the U.K. for instance, in some cases we’re lacking alternative options for the type of delivery that we’re doing. But in the long run we’re going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that we’ve used in the past. So we see a role for all carriers, in fact including the delivery service partner program that we’ve developed to help spur small businesses to help fill this need as well.  But on the cost side, yes it’s going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Stephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So Brian, I’m wondering if you can weigh in on the puts and takes on the long-term potential margin for AWS? When this was first launched it pretty much sold itself and now you are employing a greater number of salespeople, and with that I guess the incremental marketing dollars. But on the other hand it seems like the engineering talent hiring should slow down over time. So I’m just wondering if you can weigh in on what’s coming in or what’s coming out. Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yeah, sure. I would say the margins – our margins expectations are that we will price competitively and continue to pass along pricing reductions to customers both in the form of absolute price reductions and also in the form of new products that will in effect cannibalize the old ones.  And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what we’re doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term. And if you look at our disclosure on our 10-Q, it shows that we have $27 billion in future commitments for AWS, from AWS customers and that’s up 54% year-over-year. So that’s another thing to watch, it’s not only the short-term commitment, but also the long-term commitment that we see. On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best infrastructure people in the industry. If not the best, we are continually driving up efficiency and lowering costs and we see that in our bottom line.  The sales and marketing investment, we’re chasing a large opportunity here and that will be, you know as we say bumpy as we go along, but we are fully confident that that will be a very leveraged cost as we get to scale.  And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or inform our product portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Lloyd Walmsley: Thanks. Can you talk about the key drivers of the acceleration in what looks like advertising revenue within other and related to that, the press release mentions I think you are now $37 million Fire Stick users worldwide. So can you talk about maybe how much ad inventory you’ve been able to get inside of networks within that and how meaningful is this to the overall kind of advertising strategy. Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, so let me start with the first question on advertising. So other revenue, which is principally advertising grew 45% this quarter, up from 37% last quarter and the biggest thing in there is advertising and advertising grew at a rate higher than that 45%.  So we are very happy with the progress in the advertising business, continue to focus on advancing advertising experiences there, helpful for customers, helping them to see new products, we want to empower our businesses to find attracting and engage these customers and it’s increasingly popular with vendor sellers and third-party advertisers. So it’s still early and what we’re focused on really at this point is relevancy, making sure that the ads are relevant to our customers, helpful to our customers, and to do that, we use machine learning and that’s helping us to drive better, better and better relevancy.
Dave Fildes: Yeah. And then Lloyd, this is Dave. Just quickly on Fire TV. I mean I have to start with the fact that we did recently introduce 20 new Fire TV products, so that includes the new – and the first Fire TV Edition Sound Bar, Fire TV Cube. So a number of things have come out recently. We’re really excited to get into customers’ hands, so more to come there.  I think specifically on the advertising side and the opportunity with that, we are continuing to see some increased adoption. You know one of our areas of focus is expanding our video and OTT offerings for brands. It’s still early in this space, but we’ve done a few things with IMDb TV, Live Sports, things like adding more inventory through Fire TV apps, and as I said IMDb TV, adding more OTT video supply through Amazon Publisher Services or APS integrations and streamlining access for third party apps and really just making it easier for advertisers to manage their campaigns and provide better results. So, as I said early days, but I think with the engagement of the device community, the fact that we’re really excited with the progress and improvements of these devices, I think yeah, again a lot of opportunity there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed.
Scott Devitt: Thanks. There has been a meaningful reacceleration in paid unit growth in the past two quarters with the expansion of the One Day guarantees for Prime customers, and I’m just wondering if consumers are responding more in certain categories that you would highlight over others or is the response fairly broad-based across the product categories where One Day has been expanded? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Hi, Scott. Yeah, what I can tell you is that yes, the unit growth has been reaccelerated in the last two quarters and actually Amazon Fulfilled unit growth is growing at a higher clip. So we do attribute it to One Day.  We’re seeing broad sales across all categories. So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that we’ve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Mahaney: Hey, thanks, I want to go back to AWS. When asked about margins, you first referred to – Brian you first referred to by bringing down prices. Are you seeing anything different in terms of the level of price competition? Could you talk about what kind of traction you’ve had building out into the enterprise, and I know it’s a broad question, but take a shot at it. And third part of this is, your interest and your success in going in and generating more app – you know going up the stack and getting more into the application software space, all that AWS related. Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Hi, Mark. So yeah, I would say my comments around pricing were as much mix as absolute price decreases or competitive price pressures. It’s certainly a competitive market that we see and we’ve seen for really a number of years. So everyone is very sharp on their pricing and is very eager to lock up long-term commitments from AWS customers.  We do it with you know a combination of price and capability that we think is unmatched. So the bigger element of that really is around us creating new products and services that are cheaper and less expensive than the old ones. So there is a certain bit of mix issue that we are always up against.  But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think the enterprise, we’re making great progress there. You know it’s going to be hard on revenue growth, it’s going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, it’s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make or some are faster than others and some have other work to do before they can migrate.  So you know there’s a lot of factors at play there on the enterprise business, but we are having great success and we’re adding a lot of sales force or sales representatives, especially for the enterprise market.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, and Mark, this is Dave. Just really quickly just in terms of your question on the stack. I mean I think for really since as long as AWS has been around, we really pride ourselves in getting really top, high caliber people both in the technical side, but also sales people that are plugged in and listening to customers, understanding issues that are emerging, having open lines of communication and that’s really allowed us to innovate quickly and really faster than anyone else, and we see that in the terms of the service and feature breadth and depth that we have. So, a lot of the focus for us is really making sure that that flywheel keep spinning, and that we continue to roll out a lot of great services the customers are looking for. So I think that’s largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether it’s kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed.
Colin Sebastian: Thanks. Maybe first is a follow-up on the logistics and delivery side. I’m wondering if you could give us some sense for the portion of SKUs in the U.S. or orders in the U.S. that are now delivered through your own network of drivers and partners.  And then secondly, there have been some reports that Amazon is or on occasion is delivering products for other merchants or suppliers, not specifically tied to an Amazon order. So just wondering if you view this as another potential opportunity down the road as you get excess capacity and on the logistics side? Thanks.
Dave Fildes: Yeah Colin, hey it’s Dave. Thanks for the question. On that second point, in terms of how we think about the capacity we might have for our own, I think you know – I’d start with, you know we’ve got a great relationship with third party carriers across the countries where we operate.  Over time I think you know we’ll look and expect to be able to grow our internal volume using AMZL or Amazon Logistics, but also continue to grow our 3P volumes with carriers, transporters around the world. But our focus is really on ensuring that we’ve got capacity from available resources, whether it’s our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure we’re able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Justin Post: Great, thank you all; it’s going to be a couple here. Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season, do you think that’s going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon?  And then secondly, just thinking about the regulatory environment. I wonder if you could just comment on the opportunities and the competitiveness for third-party sellers. Are there other platforms that you see for them and how do you think about their profitability on Amazon, if you can comment on that at all? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, yeah. On third party I would say we only succeed if the third party sellers succeeds. So we’re heavily invested in them as they are in us. So we are constantly investing on their behalf, adding new products and features and you know we are cognizant of their economics as well and we want a business that works for both of us and we set our fees accordingly. So I think that you know we’ve – and I’ll also point out that with the One Day, the increase in One Day sellers have participated, and not as much as anyone else, as much as our 1P offering. So, it’s been a great boon for sellers as well as, particularly in our FBA program.  On the holiday season question, we are not anticipating that the move of you know the shorter time period between Thanksgiving and you know Christmas Day is going to be that impactful. What we found in the past is that there is generally a holiday budget that is spent somewhere between November 15 and - November 1 maybe and December 25, and well certainly Black Friday and Cyber Monday are important dates in that holiday period.  You know there is - the purchase tend to move around. Some have been moving early in the quarter, some of them moving later in the quarter as customers can count on and receive very quick shipments at the end and have higher faith in delivery just before the holidays. So that’s a little bit color, that’s what’s anticipated in our guidance that we’ve given.
Dave Fildes: Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. ";[0.0870638027865227, 0.04094060460324678];0.04094060460324678;0.0870638027865227;1
91;AMZN;2020-01-30;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Operator: At this time, we will now open the call for questions.  Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Heath Terry: Great. Thanks. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the strength particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?
Brian Olsavsky:
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Colin Sebastian: Great. Thank you. Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter if that's what you're referring to 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis. And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA which has higher fee set than MFN does. So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Justin Post: Great. Thanks. Just wondering if you could go high level, what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side? Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange, but what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.
Jason Helfstein: Thanks. Just to ask about AWS again. I mean, the investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about again the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition. So, maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts, but just any more you can talk about the competitive environment? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So, we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So, we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers. As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Stephen Ju: Okay. So thank you. I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can do to reduce friction between logistics payments and some of the other factors there? And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long-tail inventory? Is it merchandise that you can get to exports to global buyer base? And do you think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon? Thank you.
Dave Fildes: Yes Stephen, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those say MSMBs micro-small and medium-sized businesses. We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025. So, this $1 billion investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025. A lot of different facets to those types of investments, won't go into too much for specifics, but a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, the first one Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter. Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in variable costs sort of still associated with one-day and the processes and the opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go throughout 2020. And then, maybe any specific product categories or good categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from one day that you’d call out?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter. We -- that carried into Q3-- was slightly higher in Q3. And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty. It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance. And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year. And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that doesn't mean the delta goes to zero. It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day. So, I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going. If you look at the efficiency or the -- first the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Partners are adding new routes. Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and that creates efficiency.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Dan Salmon: Thanks for taking the question guys. Brain, just to follow-up on one-day shipping. You noted that you begin to lap the beginning of the initiative here in the second quarter and that naturally costs can flow up with volumes. But just to be clear with you is the idea here is we anniversary at that sort of incremental expansion of one-day shipping either regionally or certain SKUs is functionally finished. I just want to make sure I understand that properly. And then just -- we can see the other number reported. Just any color within there on the advertising business. And in particular would love to hear an update just a bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an important growing part. Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Let me start on the one-day. So, yeah, we do see expansion of the one-day program as we move through the year. We've been expanding since we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, additional routes, additional zip codes. But more -- I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an -- more effort internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our selection of one-day in -- particularly in Europe and Japan. We started with higher one-day percentage of our shipments in those geographies, but we do have to take steps and are taking steps to increase that. And we expect that to be -- it started to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.
Dave Fildes: Yeah, Dan. In terms of your question around brands. We're focused on the certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So, things that we're really excited about stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are share their story. So, we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this given our retail business. On the advertising business, or rather I should say other revenue that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. Line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is as a subset been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part question on AWS if I can. You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward. Just wanted to better understand some of the decisions that were made on useful life that drove that decision and how to think about that from a modeling perspective going forward? And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions? Thanks so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for bringing that up. So, we as a practice monitor and review, the useful life of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. In Q4 -- and we've been looking at it in both the FCs, fulfillment centers and also AWS annually. As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding four years. We have been -- for our servers and we had been depreciating them over three years. So, we are going to start depreciating them on a four year basis. It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period and then new assets will be put into play will extend out for four years instead of three and we'll continue to revisit this. I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through servers that we used in the AWS business and also the servers that we use to support our own Amazon businesses. So -- and despite that we give AWS customers and actually because of this, AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more quickly than ever before. So, we are essentially reflecting the fact that we have gotten better at extending the useful life here and now building that into our financials moving forward. Yes, you're right. It should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively under in check the last two years in the infrastructure area. But its $800 -- excuse me $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter and it will be consistent. It will change quarter-to-quarter. We will update you. But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in Q2 2020.
Dave Fildes: Yes. This is Dave. Just kind of on the modeling point too on that the $800 million is in Q1. We do think that the -- for that accounting impact effectively, we expect that that amount will decrease as we go through the year. And it's tech infrastructure assets. So, it's -- I should say the servers are tech infrastructure assets. So, when you think about segments the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed.
Ron Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I just want to ask a little bit more about the holiday season, given the beat on the top line and see if there's any way to quantify maybe the impact from the shortened holiday shopping season. I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better results and in online sales and retail third-party seller services. But is there any way to think about the six less days? And then also you mentioned last quarter, an impact from the Japanese consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan or any thoughts there would be helpful? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1. The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. So, it was a help to Q3 and a penalty to Q4. Those two items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. That was our estimate and we believe that was the actual outcome.
Dave Fildes: On the international?
Brian Olsavsky: On the international segment excuse me yes. The -- sorry the first question was for the holiday season. Yes, we don't see that as a factor actually. And I mentioned that last call as it wasn't incorporated into our guidance in a negative fashion. The way we look at it and the way we believe it works at least in our business is that customers will have a holiday budget and they will spend it between generally the middle of November. It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the shipping threshold cutoff. So, there's a polarization of tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me early purchase and late purchases. As far as, the six days that sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to shift gears to grocery. I know you added Amazon Fresh into Prime kind of removing the previous $14.99 a month component there and putting it into Prime and you talked about the 2,000 U.S. cities and towns with two-hour delivery. Can you just talk about what the early impact there is of bundling kind of Fresh into Prime at this point? And then just how you're thinking about your grocery strategy as you're positioned now? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for your question. So, early results are good. We -- our grocery delivery orders from the combination of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market more than doubled in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So, we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this. We wanted to take -- we will see where people's tastes and preferences will take them. We are -- whether they go to the store, the Whole Foods Market store, whether they use Prime Now or Amazon delivery for their groceries. Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand and the customers' preferences and we'll do so for the foreseeable future.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks for including me. Then I'll throw off three quick ones. Just talk a little bit more about gross margins in the quarter. You had -- the year-over-year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned reverse and was up this quarter. So, if there are any unusual factors you'd want to call out there. Second the -- I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every year for the last five years you've always guided to operating profit down sequentially and then you may be delivered better than that, but you always guided down. This year your high end of your range is actually above what you obviously did in the fourth quarter. Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the mix shift in the business towards AWS and advertising is just changing the profit profile of the business? So, any more color there? And then last one since Sunday is coming up. I know you talked about the AWS customers and you mentioned the Seattle Seahawks, but what about the 49ers? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Good luck 49ers. I'll get that out there first. Good luck Ken Sachse fan. We're indifferent. Let me start with your second one on -- sorry, the -- start with gross margin.
Dave Fildes: Yes. So, I don't think there's anything too surprising caught there. I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business. You saw that accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are sold through, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with faster shipping and whatnot. We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even better for sellers. AWS had a strong quarter of course so that helps on the gross margin side as well. And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year. So, certainly up a good deal versus the trend line we saw in 2018. But of course that's reflective of one-day and overall relative to our expectations. As Brian said with the $1.5 billion we guided to it came in a bit under that. So some of that was certainly part of some better-than-expected trends efficiencies. 
Brian Olsavsky: And on the comment on seasonality of guidance and Q1 that -- I think the historic trend of peaking a bit in operating income in Q4 and then stepping down in Q1 has been broken up a little bit as we've had the balance of AWS and some other things. But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating income quarter on record. And that's one of the -- makes a difficult comp this year, because we had the -- if you remember the slowdown in expenditures in 2018 in things like fixed -- adding of headcount, warehouse space, infrastructure costs, not to zero, but like down off of prior investment levels in 2016 and 2017. A lot of that continued -- that cost baseline continued into Q1 of 2019 and it actually was a super-efficient quarter from a cost and profit standpoint. Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year because we didn't really have one-day in Q1 of last year. But -- so I think there's -- it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore. I will though mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower depreciation from our extension of our server useful lives, which is part of the range that we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion.
Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[0.2689001176660717, 0.14647817690227893];0.14647817690227893;0.2689001176660717;1

After the presentation we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded.For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer: Hello and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO, Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you. It includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC. Including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration of the spread of the pandemic, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, work force staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the impact on suppliers creditors and third party sellers all of which are uncertain.Our guidance also assumes, among other things, we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our business services and therefore, our actual results to differ materially from our guidance.And now I will turn the call over to Brian.
Brian Olsavsky: Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past two months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it has also been a time of heroic action by healthcare workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities.This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time. I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen at Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis.Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand. Particularly for household staples and other essential products, across categories such as health, and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes, and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network.And with our seller community and our suppliers, what we generally have experienced getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods.The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels, while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining six foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies.We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network. In our Whole Foods stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers, and reserve special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund, and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy.We took steps to dampen demand for non-essential products, including reducing our marketing spend. Our network pivoted to shipping priority products within one to four days and extending promises on non-priority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts.Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores, with more than half of our units sold or from third-party sellers. We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60%, and expanded in store pickup at Whole Foods stores from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers and the overall effort to fight the COVID virus.AWS has created data lake to assist healthcare workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis, and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling video conferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC, with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance, and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID related costs in Q1, and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp up of new employees.Investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, our wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs, as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for non-essential items.While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.With that, let's open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas Anmuth: First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID related incremental costs in Q2, you talk about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in Q2 and whether over time does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Doug, first on testing. So, we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we needed to test our scale of employees.So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to - and to again, we'll see how we do that differently and I don't know, you know again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is, is getting testing in the hands of our employees and then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas.On the spending, a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people cost, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I am only - we’re only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months. And we'll continue to update this, but for now, most of what we see are temporary cost in the scheme of things, but certainly very expensive temporary costs. And also ones that we're not sure how long they'll last.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: I have two, Brian. The first one, is the current situation is, sort of I think, in many ways sort of showcase the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? And any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this?Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far in the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current [indiscernible] you've been going through?
Brian Olsavsky: Well, I think we've learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or a Prime Day then it is to be ready for something like this when everything hits at once. High demand and also a need to restock automatically and prepare for it. So that's not something that we want to keep learning, but we're doing our best to maintain and provide key services for, and essential items for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers.On the Prime program, what we're seeing is, again, you're seeing a lot of pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our prime customers are shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits.So in March, for the first time viewers nearly doubled, which is I think a good time for people to when they're, a lot of them are staying at home to stay entertained. And you'll see our video collection. It's also beyond kind of Prime Video. It's also our channels and video rentals also went up, as I'm sure others in the entertainment business saw that as well.I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions related to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication side using people using Alexa calling and drop in.So I think the Prime story is that shopping is, you know, really important for people now, especially when they, those people can't leave their houses. I think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they are handling the additional demand, and it gives it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillment efficiencies? The way you track it pre-COVID, Amazon was able to, had some sort of level of standard of meeting demand with within a certain period of time, how low that got given the surge in demand, and where you are in terms of the recovery? In other words, when are you going to be - how long will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre-COVID? How far are you away from that?And then the second one was, could you talk about the AWS business? And I guess I would have expected maybe the growth rates were really robust, but maybe even a kick up in the growth rate? What are you seeing there in terms of, I assume there is much greater usage of AWS now? Is that something that would show up in the P&L, maybe on a delayed basis? Just talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis. Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1on such a large base, again, we're, now it's $41 billion run rate, and that's 33% year-over-year. But what we're seeing post-COVID is, it varies by industry. I think what is probably where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers, there's millions of active customers from start-ups, to enterprises, to public sector. So there's a lot of variance.And again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like videoconferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment all are seeing much higher growth and usage. And things like hospitality and travel certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly. So, I think there's going to be a mixed bag on industries, and of course this is will be tied to general economic conditions for the country and the world, quite frankly.So right now where we want to be there for our customers. We want to be able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job at that, I believe.On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you were talking about one day, probably is the heart of your question, when we will get back to what we have seen and levels of one day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind of absorb this shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations.We had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping period from one to four days, and then further on non-essential items. I had restrict things that were coming into the warehouses, and focus on the essential products. So we think that is still was the right course of action. And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as far as the shipping of non-essential items and the speeding up of one-day shipments.I will explain a bit on the one-day shipping cost, because it's aligned with this. So we originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on one-day shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is, we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's - in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to ship things two-day, three-day, four-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment.But most of our one-day costs are really what we've done to our logistics networks to allow for one-day shipping. Things like putting inventory closer to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the day.So those are actually coming in, all those things are coming in very handy to us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have. And we're glad we've made that investment, but we don't actually see a savings because we're still shipping things once they're available very quickly to customers.So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock, picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still coming quickly. It's taking longer to get things into our warehouse and out of our warehouse. So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that up, and that will, when we do that we'll see a resumption of more one-day service.But, right now things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when that day will be or what point in Q2 or Q3 or beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. Yesterday, during Microsoft's call they had mentioned that they had seen two years worth of digital transformation in the cloud in two months. I'm curious if you, how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as we've gone into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this has meant for AWS, and the rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more broadly?And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the second quarter. If we adjust for that implies a pretty material increase in profitability quarter over quarter. Any sense of, or any sense that you can sort of share with us just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How much of that is annualizing the one-day investments in the efficiencies that you're seeing there, versus anything else in particular that you would that you would call out?
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, so first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments. You may have heard us talk about digital transformation. I think what I would say is, we've continue to see a healthy adoption of our business and healthy usage not only in the United States but globally.Our backlog of future contracts continues to build, and I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the most functionality, largest vibrant community of customers and partners having really proven operational and security experience. And building what customers need in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and other really key areas has not been impeded by this COVID crisis yet.And yes, we are seeing different performance in different industries. But our sales force is still there to help, help not only with current capacity, but also the transition to new, as people make that journey onto to the cloud. And then expand their use of the cloud.On the $4 billion, or sorry, on the Q2 guidance. I think the question is perhaps if how do we have a range that's above zero, if we have $4 billion of cost? Is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think there is - there are some efficiencies that would leverage that we get on fixed cost on higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have high volumes.There's also been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties using direct shipments to customers as companies are - you get more capability both in this country and other countries. We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have, again, very much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there and there's some products that are still out of stock.So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable marketing in those situations. And we continue to, we believe we'll be saving travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in, I would say in a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost.So there's a lot of moving parts here, but certainly the investment we're making in the COVID response is pretty significant. On the one-day, I would remind you that the one-day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year-over-year basis as it's been in the past four quarters.And then the other thing that I would just point out is the - remember the impact of a change in the useful life of our servers, mostly hitting in the AWS business that was a $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1. And that will continue into the rest of the year. And that that again is the benefit we're seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, it's a hardware and a software challenge.And as we have had success there operating at scale for over 13 years now, we've been able to extend our useful life for assets, or recognized that we have been extending the life. So that's a benefit that we've seen in Q1, and we'll see it the remaining from here on out.
Dave Fildes: Yes, just to add to that too, is I think about $800 million or nearly $100 million benefit in the first quarter, we do expect the change to the decrease as the year progresses some. Keep in mind.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Sheridan: Maybe two, if I can. One, on the demand of the revenue side, any difference in behavior you saw in various shelter in place geographies across the world, whether it be Europe versus in U.S. or Asia in the U.S. or India, in terms of consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product categories as we went through the month of March? Be curious for what differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in response to COVID-19.And one quick one on the cost side of the equation, the cost of energy and oil have come down dramatically. Wanted to know if there was any way you would be able to call that out or an element of that in the overall cost structure as you do more of your own logistics over time. Thanks so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Sorry, Eric, I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly we would look to see lower shipping costs. Although I would, but a lot of, I mean there's certainly things that we do long haul. There's things that we reposition, the airplanes. There's things that we do on long haul trucking, and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. But we haven't quantified that, not for our guidance. I can't break it out for you right now.On how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say in the types of products that people are buying in the state home restrictions. So it's been pretty consistent. There's obviously timing differences between countries, on one certain countries and when it's maybe ones where they are in their curve, and flattening the curve and all that.I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India, where of course, we similar to other companies in India, we're now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering, and we will further expand when the Indian government announces that were allowed to resume operations. So we're in a bit of a holding pattern except for grocery in India.And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts. They did not impact Q1 business because essentially led to the closure of our French fulfillment centers in the middle of April. French customers are still able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also different experience than the other countries internationally.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: A couple, just wondering if you're seeing any sustainable changes in consumer habits you could call out, such as people converting to Prime at a more rapid rate, adding more products in the consumable categories to their subscribe and save, anything you see that could really signal a longer-term change in consumer habits, faster adoption of certain categories.And the second thing for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis? Thank you.
Dave Fildes: Justin, it's David. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I certainly point to grocery. If you look at the remainder of the online grocery is up in our online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores, but we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping and we have a number of ways for customers to do that.Prime Now, Fresh and then of course Whole Foods online for delivery or pick up. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing that increased demand so, that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on working around the clock and offering as much delivery as possible.We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores have gone up. Whole Foods stores that offer pick up capability has gone from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 150, so a lot of work being done there.On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there. It increased year-over-year at about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the Whole Foods in-store shopping experience, rather than the online order. So that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. It's again similar, saw lot of folks that were a stay at home measures were not yet in place where shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our stores.Since that time more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for the in-store shopping moderate some. So a lot of work being done there, both in for the workers that are doing to delivery in the workers that are in the stores.A lot of focus on our part to make sure that they're safe and healthy, and able to accommodate customers make sure customers are comfortable, however they choose to shop.
Brian Olsavsky: And I'd add to that. Justin, I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people customer to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through - music, video, Alexa, certainly communication features on our devices.We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies are going direct to pay-per-view because of lack of theaters. And that was a good move by the team and that's been very well received. We've also made a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I think people are getting a better look at what's available with the Prime membership.
Justin Post: And then, second half of the quarter, are you assuming, kind of, we go back to normal as the quarter progresses and some deceleration?
Dave Fildes: Well we are heavily constrained, again it's an odd quarter because generally the biggest uncertainty we have this customer demand, and with the order and how much of it they'll order. Demand has been strong, the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that is the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find non-essential items, increasing marketing, and everything else.So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. And top line is certainly not to be taken for granted. There's always the importance of having attractive offerings in stock for customers.But usually things you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get products, yes, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted, and in this quarter, you can't. That's really where the uncertainty is driven.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Stephen Ju: So, Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I know that number jumps around a little bit, but is this primarily a matter of constrained delivery resources? And, I guess, the heightened demand? And any sort of ongoing supply chain concerns that remain worrisome for you from either a first-party perspective or from what the third-party sellers may be calling out. Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use, but also that we sell to customers, things like masks. There's general availability, but still outages of things like cleaning wipes, masks, talk about testing, but that's not something that we sell.So there are a lot of supply chain concerns are mostly in those areas right now. I'm sorry, I forgot the other part of your question. Can you remind me what you just…
Stephen Ju: The third-party unit mix de-indexing a little bit as a percentage of total this quarter. I'm just wondering if that's just normal fluctuations, or are you just prioritizing the first-party delivery against what's probably limited resources on the heightened demand.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this period, because it's not so much we're restricting and favoring 1P or anything. It's we're prioritizing essential items, and a lot of those tend to be, especially in the consumable area tend to be retail supplied items from vendors.So I would say that is the reason that FBA would have not have been as high as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, and sellers are taking that opportunity ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P mix right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up our warehouse as well.Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's the ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has never been more important and we're very grateful to our third-party sellers. They've been through a lot as well.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge: On advertising, the other revenue growth line accelerated. Could you just discuss how the advertising business performed in the first quarter? And any color on how it's trending in the second quarter if possible. And then in the release you indicated more, potentially more, hiring above the 175,000 headcount additions, any way to quantify and does this hiring replace kind of the seasonal hiring that you typically do at the end of the third quarter? Thanks.
Dave Fildes: Yes, sure. Let me start that second one, I don't have more for you on that. I think we'll announce as we change thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that at the time. Right now we've fully hired 175,000 people that we had discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So the other 95,000 have been hired in April.On advertising what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad revenue. On your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some other things going on in that other revenue account, the majority is revenue. But there's other, some other things, but I can tell you underneath that is that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And we're very happy with the progression of that that offering for not only sellers, authors, vendors and positive impact it's had on customer selection.But we did start to see some impact. Yes. In March, some pullback from advertisers and some downward pressure on price, but how but advertising continues to advertise at a high cliff. It wasn't as noticeable maybe as with what some others are seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing.But I think we have a the large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which offsite which may have been disproportionately impacted at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well. And it can be directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on advertising, or are their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its value. It has in the past.
Brian Olsavsky: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[0.0, nan];;0.0;0
93;AMZN;2020-07-30;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead.
David Fildes: Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I’d like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times.
Operator: At this time, we’ll now open the call up for questions. We ask each caller, please limit yourself to one question.  Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you’re seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized non-essentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus non-essentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and two-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great. Thank you so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming non-essential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April. So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high. On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much zero cost – or excuse me, zero profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs.
David Fildes: Yes. And this is just David. I think just from a geographic perspective, Brian’s opening comments there, a lot of these order trends and activity, you can see that both the North America and the International segment are growing well. So a lot of those kind of trends in category performances and first-party and third-party seller growth, whether it be merchant fulfilled or FBA sellers, we’re seeing a lot of growth across the board, kind of similar-type broad trends when you think about the U.S. and North America as well as our international regions, in particular, our more established international regions.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: Okay. So two, just a quick follow-up on Eric’s question. Brian, when do you think you’ll get back to par in terms of one day being one day? And then secondly, these profit levels are super high now. They’re becoming super high at the company if you ex out the COVID costs. Is Jeff aware of how profitable the company is becoming? Is he happy about it? And I’m kind of being facetious, obviously, when I asked that. But what I also want to ask really is when you think about new investment areas, and at the top of the list, maybe some new international launches are really building out some of the markets that you’ve – like India, Brazil and Mexico or the business-to-business operations, like there’s a ton of new investment areas, and it seems like the Amazon historically, and I’m sure it’s the same now, would be using this kind of revenue surge and really investing aggressively in these new areas. So just talk about that. I know you’ve got spend on COVID, but as you think about the next three to five years, you’ve got these really profit surges. How can you deploy those? Or how do you want to deploy those into some of the newer investment areas? Thanks a lot.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thanks for your questions, Mark. First, on when we get back to par, we don’t know yet. We’re getting progressively better, but we’re also balancing what is going to be very stepped up demand and capacity in Q3 and Q4. So if you look at our historic run rates and can see how big a quarter Q2 was, Q2 was actually higher revenue than Q4 of last year, which is unheard of. And Q3 is now forecast to be also higher than Q4 of last year. So we’ve kind of moved the peak forward, and for different reasons, we’re trying to, mainly, like as I said, first priority is getting – is making sure our employees are safe and that we continue to do social distancing and keep everybody safe and healthy. Second priority is getting capacity online because we do not have – in Q2, we generally have lower revenue. And in Q2, like I mentioned, we were able to use the excess capacity that did exist to serve the higher demand. Now as we move into Q3, we’re starting to – we need to build the inventory more for Q4, and we’ve run out of space. So we’ve got our hands full on that challenge, but we’ve got a really good team that’s been working very hard probably since late February on this issue. And when you talk about profitability, we’ll also mention that there are a couple of expenses that have gone down in the interim. Marketing, we cut marketing probably by about 1/3 in Q2 as – mainly because we’re trying to manage demand. It started to normalize and get back to somewhat normal levels in – at the end of Q2, but – and therefore, we’ll see a higher level in Q3. But certainly, marketing costs were lower. You probably saw it in a lot of companies. Travel expenses have almost drawn to a halt. Meeting costs, even medical costs in some examples or in some cases have been delayed as people don’t go to the doctor or don’t go there as quickly. We think that will normalize over time. And as far as investments, we’ve got a lot of investments already in play. So I don’t think it’s a matter of necessarily accelerating investment or – we’re always looking for new investments that make sense to us. But during this time, I would say we’ve actually accelerated our ops investment. We pulled in capacity that we probably didn’t think would be needed until 2021, maybe later. On grocery, we’ve also greatly expanded our grocery delivery capacity, and that’s probably ahead of schedule.
David Fildes: Yes. This is Dave. Just to add to that, I think Prime is such a big focus, and some of the growth statements that Brian talked about at the opening of the call, whether it was strength in Prime membership and the acceleration we saw in the U.S. or worldwide or some of the usage stats like the grocery momentum or the doubling of video hours, for us, it’s just another encouraging sign. We think there’s still a lot more value we can add to that program. And that’s not just in the United States where we’ve got sort of a broader set of services than some of the other regions, but really focusing on supporting in some of those other regions. And so we’ve got places like Australia, the Middle East. We’ve talked about India many times, but a lot of focus on building that out. I think what’s great about a place – all geographies with a place like India is we’re really focused on digitizing the Indian sellers. A lot of micro, small and medium-sized businesses there. We launched some new features there to help support the digitization efforts with some of those brands and just a lot of work, great work being done by that team. They have some goals there around getting more sellers on board and hiring many more people as well. So a lot of focus there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, Brian, is going back to the investments, and you’re often making multiyear investments for customers and customer offerings, and you’re the man behind the capital allocation plan. I guess I’d be curious to hear about can you give us some examples of areas of investment that may have been pushed out this year because of shelter in place and the higher demand that you’ve been seeing? So what were areas where you thought you were going to spend more at the start of the year than you actually have now in the current 2020 plan? And then the second one, the international strength, I appreciate the color on Europe and Japan. Nice to see the profitability. Maybe just talk to us sort of qualitatively about some puts and takes around your core international markets, Europe and Japan? And how to think about whether or not they could be more or less profitable than the U.S. long-term? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I think you’ll – starting with that second one. You’ll notice that the International segment was profitable this quarter, and that’s a great sign. It is heavily driven by the pickup in demand that we saw, as I mentioned, I believe, in multiple calls. What’s going on internationally is we have some very healthy established countries that we’ve been in a long time. And we have probably accelerated their adoption of Prime benefits. We’ve pushed video and devices and music and other things to those countries probably earlier in the life cycle than you would have seen in the U.S. So there’s a bit of a forward investment on Prime benefits in many of those countries. But what you also see are investments in new countries. Obviously, India is the biggest one, but also, to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Brazil, Turkey and Australia are recent addition. So there’s always an element of expansion going on there. Advertising is growing, so that’s a good source of profitability. But if you look at what happened in Q2, it was essentially just the much higher volumes than we had anticipated or had on a run rate. So our fixed costs were leveraged to the hilt. Obviously, we will add some capacity and things in transportation and fulfillment centers, but all other fixed costs were pretty much leveraged on that higher demand. The UK in particular, was very strong because there’s probably more stay-at-home orders and the way the economy was developing in the UK. We had a very, very strong quarter there. So I would say that the surge in demand internationally also helped drive that profitable, maybe a little earlier than the trajectory would have shown. And I’m not sure that, that is going to continue for the next couple of quarters, but it’s a good sign that we could leverage that. And a lot of the same trends in the U.S. were apparent internationally, higher Prime – more frequent Prime purchases and higher basket sizes. So all good signs, and perhaps we got a glimpse of the future on the demand curve. Your second question on slowing investments. The list is very short on what we’ve had to slow down. It’s mostly – it hasn’t been done necessarily for cost reasons, it’s been done for people reasons. The one I’d point to is studios. We’ve had to delay production. I think most studios have. And that’s been augmented by some new things like our Amazon cinema where we’re having first run movies. And so I think in this time, when people want entertainment, people are having trouble creating new content across the board. And that’s a bit of a challenge, but it’s not something we’re doing intentionally. We’re doing it to protect the actors and film crews, and we think that’s the right decision. As I said, a lot of the investments are being pulled in, especially on the upside and grocery delivery, same-store pickup. A number of whole food stores that you can pick up deliveries on tripled this quarter. So the list is short on things that we’re slowing down on, I would say. It’s just we’re adapting and probably looking at whether some things have changed and creating some things for the new environment, especially in the entertainment area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. Brian, first, just curious about your overall thoughts on how the e-commerce adoption curve has been shifted here over the next few years. And anything you can share around behavior for new and existing customers. And then separately, on AWS, the $43 billion run rate obviously slowed some in the quarter, but hoping you could comment just on the pace of IT decision-making in this environment, whether you’re still impacted by some clients more highly exposed to challenged verticals? And due to those factors, is it possible that AWS can accelerate growth going forward? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Let me start with that second one. Thanks, Doug. So in the AWS segment revenue, what we see are companies are working really hard right now to cut expenses, especially in the more challenged businesses like hospitality and travel but pretty much across the board. We’re helping them. We’re actively, with our sales force, looking for ways that we can help them save money. This includes things like scaling down the usage where it makes sense or benchmarking their workloads against our architectural best practices. So that’s not going to help our usage growth in the short run, but it will help those customers save money. And we think that’s the right thing to do, not only for their success and so they can come out of this at a better shape but also for the long-term health of our relationship with them as an AWS provider. But we’re also seeing a lot of companies that are really wishing that they had made more progress on the cloud because they’re seeing how companies that are on the cloud can turn into a variable cost and either scale up or scale down depending on their particular situation. They realize their on-premise infrastructure is not really flexible to go up or down. And especially in the time of sinking demand, it’s a big fixed cost for them. So we expect – we’re seeing migration plans accelerate. They’re certainly not going to happen overnight, but we see companies moving more in that direction. We think that will be a good long-term trend. And there’s certainly winners in this area right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning and entertainment. All are seeing usage growth. And it’s a bifurcated world out there. So the – on your e-commerce adoption, I think it’s hard to tell. We’re super encouraged by the fact that grocery delivery has picked up, and that’s been accelerated versus what we would have thought. We certainly are glad to be there for our Prime members who are shopping more frequently and buying more. We do know that there’s reasons that there are other options are limited. I mean there are always retail options out there, especially to go pick up in store, but less people want to go into stores perhaps now. So we’re going to have to see what is maybe a step-up in the curve and getting to a point quicker versus what are some onetime sales and things like – hopefully, things like masks and gloves and cleaning supplies in the fullness of time become onetime purchases, but we’ll see. And sorry, your last point was on new customers versus existing customers. We’re seeing similar trends. We’re seeing good pickup in frequency and basket size for new members in Prime as well, certainly not the same as people have been Prime members for a number of years. But it’s encouraging. And as you saw, Prime growth retention has increased. We’ve accelerated the number of – the growth of Prime members, both in the U.S. and internationally. So that’s a good sign that we’re happy about. And we hope that, that has long-term ramifications.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Sandler: Yes. Just a follow-up to that last comment. So the Prime behavior for international Prime members, you guys have talked about how like in the 16, 17 countries, the overall service levels are a little bit behind, selection is a little bit behind. So has the last few months in the pandemic closed that gap meaningfully in terms of GMV per Prime member for international versus what you see in the U.S.? Any comment there? And then on the 3Q guidance, you pushed Prime day for western markets into 4Q. So how much of the deceleration – it’s obviously a really strong number for 3Q, but the growth rate is decelerating a little bit. Is that mostly from Prime Day? Or can you just talk about what kind of behaviors you’re seeing right now as you go into 3Q? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Right. Well, we ramped up through the quarter in Q2 and ended up with 41% year-over-year growth in FX-neutral – on an FX-neutral basis. A lot of those trends are continuing into Q3. You see our revenue range is $87 billion to $93 billion coming off of $89 billion quarter. So I would say that the – if you look at the growth rate, that translates into somewhere in the 24% to 33% growth rate in Q3. So I can’t break out exactly the Prime impact because there’s – but suffice to say, it’s a big driver on why 41% growth in Q2 turns into 24% to 33% growth in Q3 on what turns out to be higher revenue volume. And then on Prime behavior, it’s – I can’t really give you more on that because it is actually a very localized set of staff by country. In international, aggregate does not matter that much. And what I would say is, generally, what we’re seeing is similar trends in international in response to COVID purchasing patterns. I wouldn’t say it closed the gap. I said – I would say they both went up. And we’ll see how it goes from there. I think there’s definitely any differences in selection or differences in shipping. There’s a myriad of factors that go into a Prime member’s decision to be a Prime member and to what they buy and what they use as far as our benefits that we give them. So I don’t want to make too many sweeping comments on that right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Brent Thill: Thanks, good afternoon. I was curious if you could just expand on AWS. There was a little bit of a slowdown across the board and a number of the cloud numbers. I’m just curious if there’s a common trend that you’re seeing there. And perhaps just talk about the backlog. I know you’ve disclosed the backlog has been improving in the filings, but a little more color on AWS would be certainly helpful. Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, sure. I’ll give you the backlog number. It grew 65% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. So that’s healthy, and we have the average contract length is over three years for our AWS contracts. I would say contract volume and negotiations are strong and have maintained through this period. So it is – that’s a good sign. It really does boil down to short-term versus long-term incentives here for a lot of our customers. They’re – if you’re in an industry that’s been heavily impacted by COVID in the economy, you’re looking for ways to save money and you’re trying to do a click and we’re trying to help in that regard. And one of the best ways to save money long-term is to use the cloud, not only to turn it into a variable cost, it could be a fixed cost, but also to be able to take advantage of the partner network that we have, the security that we have and also the constant evolution of products and services that we bring to market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Aaron Kessler: Great. A couple of questions. First, maybe just one of your competitors noted that growth was slowing in some markets that have opened up, I guess, probably more in Europe. Maybe just thoughts there. Are you seeing any changes in sort of the markets that are starting to open up? And just any commentary on the Zoox acquisition, how you kind of – can use that technology longer term as well? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: I imagine you mean on consumer business, countries opening up.
Aaron Kessler: Correct.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. Well, we still see strong demand. So I don’t have any particular color on that regard by country. We do think probably the UK was very – grew very strongly in Q2, and that, I believe, is starting to moderate a bit but still stronger than normal. So I don’t want to go by country, but I think those trends will start to perhaps become evident. But the – from our vantage point, the Prime members still continue to order more frequently and in larger basket sizes.
David Fildes: Yes. And then, Aaron, just on your second question on Zoox, I mean, it’s – there’s not too much to say at this point. It’s still pretty early, but I think it probably goes without saying it’s a tremendously forward-thinking team, which resonates with us. And they really do kind of pioneer in that space, the ride-hailing space. So a lot of cool work they’re doing, designing autonomous vehicles and focused on the passenger, right, in front of mind in that. So I think, again, just as we think about kind of the innovation components and commitments to solving kind of problems and challenges for customers, it’s pretty exciting for us to be able to work with them and bring that vision to fruition in the years ahead.
Operator: Our final question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Great. A couple of questions. Obviously, a great cost quarter on the leverage side. Any changes in e-commerce gross margins to call out? Is scale and getting size, improving gross margins or anything on the mix shift there that’s interesting? And then secondly, we talked about a lot about one day investment last year. Obviously, the shipping times were impacted by COVID, but are you back to kind of normal times? And where are you on the one day investment? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. On one day, again, we’re first prioritizing employee safety. We have a lot of effort in that regard. We’ve changed over 150 process paths. We’ve instituted social distancing, cleaning, temperature taking, both with our warehouse employees and also our transportation employees. So that’s really still priority one. And second is capacity expansion, especially as we head into the second half of the year, which generally sees a step-up in volume even over the first half of the year. So we will – we are improving the percentage of one day. We’re not back to where we were pre-COVID. We don’t think we’re going to be back in the short run, but we will continue to improve it. And hopefully, it’ll be less noticeable for our consumer base. On the gross margin side, it’s very much a mixed bag right now. There’s – before the COVID outbreak, the positives were generally AMZL costs – delivery costs were becoming more efficient. Advertising was – and AWS were certainly a strong component of gross margin increases. Product mix could go either way depending on the country. But as this COVID has played out, consumables and grocery, which are lower margin, have started to – have been a negative impact on gross margin. But the – we feel good about where we are. Gross margin for the quarter was 40.8% and was down 200 basis points from last year. It’s probably more tied to the addition of one-day shipping. And even if we didn’t do as much one-day shipping as we’ve been doing post COVID, the costs of one-day shipping are already built into our structure. We’ve already reconfigured our network. We’ve already created the capacity to be able to ship. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can get it out through the warehouse and to you in one day or not.
David Fildes: Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[-0.03575408533520552, -0.04097650291477817];-0.04097650291477817;-0.03575408533520552;1
94;AMZN;2020-10-29;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q3 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q3 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 29, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.
Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by extending a big thank you to all the folks who worked hard to make this year's Prime Day a great success, not only for our more than 150 million Prime members around the world. But also for the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who sell on our Amazon store many of whom are facing their own challenges during this pandemic. These businesses thrived on Prime Day. With third-party sellers recognizing more than $3.5 billion in sales over the two-day global event, that's 60% increase compared to Prime Day last year. I also want to thank and recognize the contributions of more than one million Amazon employees and delivery partners who are continuing to work hard to serve our customers all around the world, who will continue to spend what it takes to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. Now let me share some highlights from the quarter. Our Q3 results largely reflect a continuation of demand trends we saw when we exited the second quarter. The strong demand in sales growth across our major product categories globally including hardlines, consumables, softlines and media. We also continue to see strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. They continue to expand their usage of Prime's digital benefits including Prime video. Internationally, the number of Prime members who stream Prime video grew by more than 80% year-over-year in the third quarter and international customers more than doubled the hours of content they watched on Prime video compared to last year. We're also reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q3, our year-over-year growth rate of online grocery sales continued to accelerate and we continue to offer more convenient options for customers including grocery pick up which is now available from all Whole Foods Market stores. And just as we saw in Q2, Prime member renewal rates improved in Q3 year-over-year. 3P sellers who as I mentioned are largely comprised of small and medium sized business continue to be important part of our offering to customers. Our 3P sellers services revenue continue to grow faster than online stores revenue. With particularly strong growth this quarter in FBA, as we return to similar mix of FBA as a percentage of total 3P units as we've seen prior to COVID. 3P units continue to represent over half of overall unit volume increasing to 54% of the total unit mix in Q3. We're investing heavily to support sellers and are pleased to report that over half a million sellers are seeing record sales in our stores this year. We continue to focus on stepped up employees safety particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations. To help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners as well as the employees and customers shopping at our Whole Foods Market and other stores. This of course has added incremental cost to our P&L. The largest portion of these costs relate to continue productivity headwinds in our facilities including process revisions to allow for social distancing and incremental cost to ramp up new facilities and the large influx of new employees hired to support strong customer demand. This also includes investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning of our facilities. In total, we've incurred more than $7.5 billion in incremental COVID related costs in the first three quarters of 2020 and we expect to incur approximately $4 billion in Q4. Our consolidated revenue and operating income exceeded the top end of our guidance range. As demand remains strong in the quarter the extra volume and operating leverage helped us to achieve higher than expected profitability. And we saw another strong quarter of revenue growth in operating income performance in AWS and advertising. We had good leverage with our fulfillment centers as well as in Amazon logistics, our transportation network despite the higher COVID related cost that I mentioned. Although we had strong growth in our network in Q3 some of our fulfillment network expansion shifted out a few weeks thought it happened in Q4 rather than Q3. Once new buildings open, their short-term headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak. More of this headwind will be felt in Q4 rather than in Q3 and this is reflected in our Q4 guidance. We were able to meet the heightened demand in Q3 because we opened up more network capacity particularly in our transportation network. I pointed two important drivers of this. First, we hired a lot more people to support the strong customer demand. We welcomed 250,000 permanent full time and part time employees just in Q3 and have already added about 100,000 more in the first month of Q4. I will note that these are permanent jobs with industry leading pay including Amazon's $15 minimum wage and great benefits such as health insurance, 401(k) plan and parental leave. Secondly, this has been a big year for capital investments. We've invested nearly $30 billion in CapEx and finance leases through the first nine months of 2020 including over $12 billion in Q3. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to grow our fulfillment and logistics network square footage by approximately 50% this year which includes significant additions to our fulfillment centers as well as our transportation facilities. Majority of these buildings open in late Q3 and into Q4. About half of this square footage growth will be on the transportation side to be opening more sort centers and delivery stations. And finally, in AWS customer usage remained strong. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. While we're busy gearing up for our Annual re:Invent Conference. This year reinvent will be a free three-week virtual conference running from November 30th through December 18th. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon who have delivered on unprecedented demand for several months now as well as a strong Prime Day in October. We're ready to go and looking forward to meeting the needs of our customers this holiday season. With that, let's move onto Q&A.
Operator:  our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my question. I've two Brian. The first one you mentioned the fulfillment center saw good leverage in the quarter. Can you just talk to us about some of the qualitative drivers of this improvement you're seeing in fulfillment cost per fulfilled unit in the quarter and sort of year-to-date and how to think about the durability of that overtime? And then secondly, I think throughout the summer Amazon logistics launched the third-party delivery service in the UK. I'm curious just to hear about early learnings from that product and how you think about scaling that to other countries and maybe globally? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Thanks for your question. Yes, the fulfillment center cost is going to be a blend of part of the COVID related cost that I mentioned in and itemized. Offset by some really strong leverage, I would say that we've been running very consistently high levels really since all of our employees came back in the first or second week of May and some of them been on unpaid leave. So that demand is very consistent and strong and has created a lot of favorable leverage because again the order pattern being high and consistent as leveraging our fixed cost assets. Things like our delivery routes are more dense at high volumes. So we see even transportation some increased efficiencies. Offsetting that again is productivity elements that we've articulated things like social distancing, extended breaks. Other steps we're taking to keep people safe and distanced in our facilities, in our delivery network.
Dave Fildes: And this is Dave, I don't have much to share I think on, what we've got going on with any of  efforts other than I'll just say, we're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support. The companies we work with including small and medium-sized businesses we sell on Amazon and that includes testing and shipping programs that can help any of these businesses gets packages to customers quickly and reliably.
Brian Nowak: Great, thank you both.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian just wanted to go back to the 4Q operating income guide. I appreciate your thoughts there. Just trying a dig a little bit deeper in terms of how you're thinking about it kind of beyond the $4 billion in COVID cost. It still feels like maybe there's some more in there that we're not thinking about perhaps beyond the square footage increases and the incremental headcount. So if you've any comments there? And just curious I know it's early on 2021, but you've obviously done a ton of investment this year and with the 50% square footage increase and you tend to cycle at times in terms of CapEx investment. Just how you think about   that kind of build out as you go forward? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Doug. One last comment, I forgot to mention to Brian on his last question is, the fact that a lot of that heightened demand so far coming to Q2 and Q3 when we tend to have excess capacity before Q4, so that's another source of leverage especially in non-peak orders. As far as guidance is concerned again, I think there's lot of uncertainty certainly in Q4. We generally have a lot of uncertainty around the holiday things from holiday spending to what our cost to fulfill normal orders would be whether issues that can come up this year's an election year. We saw some disruption in 2016, so there's a whole host of issues that generally come to bear in Q4. I think the fact that COVID is dwarfing all of those is causing us a lot of uncertainty on our top line range. We saw continuation in Q3 of some really good trends from Q2 and we've project those into Q4. Some of the negative factors that you mentioned as foreign profitability is again. We'll see more of the brunt of the capital investment and the people investment. We had a lot of people in the last quarter and then we added another 100,000 people in October so far. So there's that, there's generally the dynamics of Prime Day because it's a deal-oriented time period that's usually not the highest margin period and that shifted into Q4. But generally, we have really because of the calendar this year we have really built our capacity included both in facilities and people and are carrying it through the entire quarter. We carried it through Prime Day and now we're carrying it through into the rest of the quarter. I think in other quarters you might have seen more gradual build up that would have occurred through October end and probably maximized in November and December. So that's what I would tell you on holiday again. We have our normal caveats, so there's a lot of uncertainty and things that could go right and wrong, so that's why we put a range around it. And I'm sorry, could you repeat your second question?
Doug Anmuth: Just on how you think about 2021 perhaps just CapEx build out going forward given that you've really stepped up the investment in 2020?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. I think some of the investment things like grocery delivery and that capacity are things that we would have invested in over time and it being matched by higher order volume. So our intent is to continue to deliver a great grocery delivery experience for our customers. So that is a little bit of pull forward. Yes, we did expect to build out our logistics capacity a lot this year especially as we have been rolling out one-day delivery the middle of last year, that was setting us up for a big build this year. So we pull forward a bit from 2021 into this year to satisfy the demand. I think we've - the logistics team is really good at in one way you're locking up long-term commitments on space and buildings. But on the other hand being able to adjust the timeline in or out to match the capacity and demand. I think at this point we're not trying to cut it close and we're erring on the side of having too much capacity and we think that's the right call. It has been this year. We'll adjust as we get through the holiday and we'll learn a lot more. Hopefully the pandemic will be in better shape as a country and globe in Q1 of next year. It's very reactionary at this point. We've got to play the hand that we're dealt and we're trying to anticipate and keep the customer insulated from any variability. But it's challenging certainly.
Doug Anmuth: Thanks for the color Brian.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Great, thanks. When you look at 3Q the environment, can you help us kind of understand the best you can quantify. How much of the incremental unit sales do you think are being aided by COVID or how much is it just a natural recurring shift online that could recur and continue to grow next year? Any thoughts on that? And then same type of question for the cloud? I'm guessing there's some headwinds of lower transaction volumes for some of your customers and then maybe there's more demand from the work at home environment. So if you could give us any thoughts on both the retail and cloud and how COVID is impacting it and could there be - how that will impact next year? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. It's hard to predict. I would say that there's been phases of this year. Early on there were a lot of stock ups of groceries and other household supplies followed by a wave of people buying gloves and disinfectant wipes and masks. That maybe a bit of bubble that people are not going to buy as much next year hopefully that will be a good problem to have it, as that demand went down. But otherwise we're seeing Prime number engagements. So it's strengthening our Prime program. The renewal rates are going up and the engagement is going up. So people are buying more frequently and across more categories. They're using more of our digital benefit. We like the trends on kind of connectedness to our Prime program and we think that will have lasting value. When things open up a bit more and there's more store options for people to buy from, there will be leveling of volume back to the stores I would imagine. So we think the trends are good. They've been pulled forward probably a bit from our - the adoption curves have been pulled forward from our initial - pre-COVID thinking especially on things like grocery delivery. So your second question on the cloud. Cloud is a mixed bag right now because we're very happy with the cloud performance and we're seeing a lot of customers who are now moving to the cloud at a faster pace. It accelerated their plans. There's anomalies in different industries going on this year things like travel and hospitality are down. A lot of companies are in holding pattern in middle and some are doing really well things like video conferencing, and gaming, and remote learning, and things tied to entertainment. So I would say that majority of the companies though are looking for ways to cut down on expenses. Going to cloud is a good way to cut down on expenses long-term. To trying to cut down on their short-term costs in the cloud, by tuning their workloads and we're helping them do that and doing the best we can to help them save short-term dollars and again tune their usage again some of our benchmark. We think that is good for the customer and therefore, it will be good for us long-term. But even and despite those actions with strong growth the year-over-year growth in absolute dollars this quarter were the largest we've ever seen and we feel good about the state of the business and the state of our sales force and their ability to drive value during this period. We've seen a lot of companies extending their contracts with us. The backlog of multi-year deals has gone up quite a bit. It's good from a customer connectedness standpoint. Certainly each industry is going through different dynamics right now.
Dave Fildes: And you can see, this is Dave. I'll just add to that. You can see number of those significant commitments of customers called in  carriers, global payments and number of others. Also seeing some good engagement with governments on their recognizing need to transform tech, get their technology more nimble and innovative. Schools and universities are planning for online learning. So a lot of help we can work with customers to provide there. On the kind of from a product perspective, we're seeing significant momentum with our AWS design Graviton2 processors. So you've got customers like SmugMug and Netflix and there's many others. But they're realizing up to 40% better price performance from the newer Amazon EC2s, the MRC T  instance families. So when you compare that to x86-based instances. Those Amazon EC2 instance families are all powered by our - with our new AWS design Graviton2 processors. So really pleased with what we're seeing there in that engagement as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: Great, thanks. Just a couple of things, how should we think about where capacity utilization of the fulfillment infrastructure is at this point with the way the growth that we've seen and the wave of new warehouse announcement? What kind of CapEx is going to be necessary to sort of bring you back to what you would consider normal levels that you'd be growing from? And then there's obviously been a lot of discussion around the capacity limitation the third-party shipping networks are going to see this holiday season given demand. How much of an issue do you see that as being and given your investments and your own delivery capacity does that become a competitive advantage for you during the holiday?
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, thanks Health. I'll start with that last one yes.  intertwined here so. The third-party shipping, we rely on third-party shippers. We've great partnerships around the globe with third-party shippers and we know that their capacity will be tight as well as ours. We do feel good that we've invested quite a bit in our own capacity and you just mentioned that, about half of our CapEx is going to expanding transportation. A lot of the people that we're hiring are also focused on transportation. So we feel good that we've been able to develop that capability a lot of this year because we needed it and we're going to need it in Q4. Having said that, it's going to be tight for everyone and I think it will all be stretched and it's advantageous to the customer and probably to the companies for people to order early this year. But regardless of the order pattern we're going to do our best to get the usual excellent service to our customers. On CapEx levels, again we've grown our fulfillment and logistics infrastructure 50% this year. We'll see again what that implies for next year. We do see continued expansion and CapEx specifically in transportation area. So that will be start of probably multi-year period where we're hiring CapEx for that. But we'll see, right now we're just focused on Q4 and giving the guidance for Q4. Your question on capacity utilization. It's been very tight this year certainly we're able to fill up a lot of our any excess capacity in Q2 and Q3 that might have seasonally been excess. As we get into Q4 and everything stepping up. We're adding it and using it simultaneously. We had a really good test for Prime Day and we feel good about that performance in that work and we continue to add on top of that. Lots of excitement around the holiday. But we feel we're in good shape and ready to go.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney: Thanks, two questions please. How should we think about these $4 billion expenses in the fourth quarter, $7 billion year-to-date like? Do you view them more as one-time-ish or just overall increases as you built out the network? Are they structural or one-time-ish I really want to get at that? Secondly international segments been nicely profitable or reasonably profitable for two quarters in a row. Is there some reason to think that's sustainable? And I'm sorry, third question. The other revenue growth accelerated to 49% can you give any color behind that? Thanks a lot.
Brian Olsavsky: Hi Mark, thank you. Let me start with the COVID question. So we have again, our expenses in Q3 were estimated to be around $2.5 billion and we're seeing closer to $4 billion in Q4. The majority of that is due to the expansion of our operations. So things like productivity that. There's productivity drags for things like new hire ramp, social distancing, extending break periods, things that we can quantify, said look this is a change in our process that has hurt productivity. We also have cost related to - so those are calculated that. There's more direct cost around cleaning and supplies, testing and those are the main things I would say. So what we're trying to do by capturing these cost as to show what is, we believe is incremental and the intent is that these for our own knowledge as well that these will once the pandemic is over hopefully that soon, that these should be cost that don't recur. Okay. We know that simultaneously there's some benefits going on right now. There's things like in Q2 we had lower marketing expense you see that in our trends. It's starting to come back in Q3 and Q4 to more normalized levels but certainly everyone. There's not a lot of requirement or need to do marketing this year for parts of the year. We saved nearly $1 billion in travel this year because travel's ground to a halt, internal travel, travel on expenses. So there's things like that will resume at a later date and maybe not get to the same levels as the past. But there won't be as artificially low as this year. So we're trying to be transparent as best we can on the cost we're seeing. We're  netting against some of the favorability's from demand and some of the other cost that might be offsetting although they're not offsetting to the extent that they COVID costs are sitting there. And then I'll point the fact that because we're running at such a high level and at consistently high level really in off peak periods. We have been able to run these warehouses very efficiently. You have to split the discussion kind of between the cost penalty on the COVID related issues. But then there's certainly been some favorability from running assets more fallout condition. Okay, so hopefully that gives you some color on it. International segment profitability. I would say and I think we discussed this a bit last quarter. We're seeing an advancement of volume and very strong volume if you will in especially in our countries in Europe and Japan. So we maybe putting in a way future volume onto this year's cost structure. So that is probably why you're starting to see that is why you're seeing profitability in international. I would say generally we're still investing ahead of the US in a lot of dimensions internationally things like Prime benefits, things like the devices, things like international expansions. You might have seen that we just launched in Sweden yesterday. There's a lot of competing factors going on right now internationally. But I think right because of the high volumes and the leverage we're seeing and particularly in places like the UK and Germany it creating profitability ahead of schedule if you will. But we should get about the level of investment that continued and we see that we're committed to continuing that even after the pandemic and including the international segment of course is India where we've had a very strong Prime Day and Diwali is off to a good start and so anyway. The third comment was on other revenue. Yes that is essentially getting mostly advertising and we had very strong advertising performance in Q3. So continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2. We start to see advertising budgets increase from some of the contraction that had occurred earlier in Q2 and we just had a lot more traffic and we do a good job of turning that traffic into valuable real estate for our advertisers and for our customers to find out more about selection and brand discovery. So most of that is with strong quarter in advertising and that's what you're seeing in the other revenue line.
Operator: Our final question will come from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One following up on Mark's question on the advertising side. You know we continue to see you guys innovate a lot on the product side especially with programmatic advertising, video advertising. Can you just give us a little bit of sense of how you see the advertising offering both on Amazon and off Amazon sort of evolving in the years ahead? And the second question would be coming back Brian to your comment in the opening remarks around Prime video and all the consumptions you've seen globally in the recent past. How does that help inform what do you think about in terms of the opportunity when invest against original content to continue to drive that sort of medium consumption loop within the Prime membership. Thanks so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes, great. Eric I'll start off with the questions on advertising. So just to ground you and I think our main priorities here at the space and some of these probably aren't too surprising is, we're focused on making our tools easier to use. Sponsored ads, sponsored brand site, a bidding sponsored product targeting. Working on just simplifying registration for agencies and marketers, getting set up. But we're also very focused on being smarter about servicing more relevant ads to customers. Making display ads easier and then increasing usability to Amazon demand site platform. So we've been working on a number of those areas and then developing new products and a lot of that's focused around, how are we serving brands from various areas Twitch  sponsored brands, stores of course, so another interesting area. We're certainly in a unique position to be able to provide measurement services that help all these brands or understand the impact of other advertising in ways they're going to help them grow their business. Video, you mentioned I think video is one that's we're working hard on with some of the OTT video advertising opportunities there. We're seeing some good momentum with that. We offer inventory and IMDB TV, ad supported space and 3P apps  pulling off the Fire TV. I think good momentum and a lot of good learning on some of those initiatives there. I won't say too much about what we'll look like next year in the future but that gives you kind of sense of priorities where we're spending our time and focused on.
Dave Fildes: And your question on video, so we step back in our goals to deliver high quality and fresh content to our global Prime member base. We're doing that by producing top tier US content that we show globally and then we augment that with local originals in each region. If we do that job well - we've seen it as a very significant acquisition channel from new Prime members especially in many smaller countries around the world. We see higher free trial conversion rates. Higher membership renewable rates and then higher overall engagement as I mentioned in Q3 specifically. And when they do that, when the more engaged they are, we know that, that turns into more sales on Amazon and it's a self-reinforcing loop. So we're very happy with the video performance particularly during this period. I think people have gotten really good chance to test out the content maybe Prime members  that benefit as much in the past, have given another look and have you know really found value in it. We're in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide and again we're seeing some really interesting localized content developing in places like India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, UK and Spain which I think the customers in those countries really appreciate.
Dave Fildes: Great, thanks for joining us today for the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[-0.01557601223652838, -0.005062684875103307];-0.005062684875103307;-0.01557601223652838;0
95;AMZN;2021-02-02;"Operator: Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.
Dave Fildes: Hello and welcome to our Q4 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, February 2, 2021 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian.
Brian Olsavsky: Thank you for joining us today. I realize that you may have questions about the news which we announced today in our press release, but I would like to begin with some comments on Q4 results, and then we can proceed to your questions. First, I’d like to start by thanking the nearly 1.3 million Amazon employees who have risen to the challenge of serving customers around the world during this pandemic. We are proud that more than 500,000 people chose to take new jobs at Amazon in 2020. We are committed to providing all employees with great jobs, including $15 an hour starting pay in the U.S., health insurance, 401(k) matching, leading parental benefits, and upskilling opportunities. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations in stores as well as the customers shopping in our Whole Foods Market and other stores. Our Q4 results include approximately $4 billion in COVID-related operating costs, including additional employee pay during the holidays. We continue to see productivity headwinds from physical separation and training of new employees and of course investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. This Q4 spend brings our total COVID-related costs for the year to more than $11.5 billion. Our teams worked hard in 2020 to ramp up in-house COVID-19 testing capabilities that are incremental to those already available to the general public. More than 700 employees are now being tested every hour, and globally we have built hundreds of COVID-19 testing sites in two labs. We are encouraging essential employees working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers, and Whole Food Market stores across the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time. We are also working at the federal and state levels to support the vaccinations of frontline employees and those in the community who are providing essential services throughout the pandemic, including enabling pop up clinics in Washington State and Florida with more on the way. Now some comments on Q4 results. Our fourth-quarter holiday season has always been the busiest time of our year. This year presented additional challenges for our teams as we work to meet strong customer demand, while simultaneously growing our operations’ footprint and welcoming far more new employees than any prior Q4. We welcomed nearly 175,000 new full and part-time employees in Q4 alone. This compares with 50,000 in Q4 of 2019. We also continue to add buildings in our fulfillment and logistics network with square footage growing about 50% year-over-year in 2020. And unlike in a typical year when new buildings are mostly in place by the end of Q3, this year a significant number of them came online in Q4 as our teams pulled out all the stops to be ready for customer demand, and it turns out we needed that capacity in order to fill the strong customer demand in Q4. Revenue for the quarter was $125.6 billion versus our guidance range of $112 billion to $121 billion. You will remember that we kicked off the holiday season early for customers with Prime Day in October versus its usual timing in Q3. We then saw strong seasonal holiday demand through Q4. Our Q4 results also largely reflect the continuation of demand trends we have seen since the early months of the pandemic, particularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples and other home products. We saw sales growth across our major product categories, led by strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. Prime members also continue to expand their usage of Prime’s digital benefits including Prime Video and Prime Video channels. Amazon Music launched podcast in September and in Q4, Prime members listened to millions of hours of podcasts each month. We’re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q4, we had another strong quarter that largely reflects the continuation of demand trends from Q3. We saw strong growth in new Prime member sign-ups. As demand remained strong in the quarter, the additional volume leverage helped to achieve higher-than-expected profits. We saw strong order volumes throughout the holiday season with good sales growth not only in our peak sales days, which include Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, but also throughout the remainder of the quarter. We had good operational performance within our fulfillment centers and transportation network even as we added significant capacity. Third-party sellers also stepped up as never before to serve customers. The 2020 holiday season was the best ever for small and medium-sized businesses selling in our store, with our worldwide sales growing over 50% year-over-year in Q4. Third-party units represented 55% of total paid units during the quarter, the highest 3P unit mix we’ve ever had since we invited businesses to sell on Amazon more than 20 years ago. Lastly, AWS’ efforts were headlined by our Ninth Annual re:Invent Conference. This is the first time in our history that the event was virtual and free. We had over 570,000 registered attendees during the three-weeks-long event. AWS continues to innovate at a rapid clip, announcing more than 180 new services and features at re:Invent across compute, storage, database, machine learning, and more. You can read more about this in our earnings release. The team also announced significant customer momentum with new commitments and migrations from JPMorgan Chase, Thomson Reuters, ViacomCBS, and Twitter just to name a few. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. In Q4, AWS saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth. AWS added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in any quarter in its history and is now a $51 billion annualized run-rate business supporting millions of active AWS customers. And just as they have all year, sellers, partners, and employees across Amazon stepped up to deliver on unprecedented customer demand, and for this we remain extremely grateful. And today, we announced that our Founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter this year and that Andy Jassy will become Chief Executive Officer at that time. Those of us who know Andy are excited to see him take on this greater responsibility. He is a visionary leader, a great operator, and he understands what makes Amazon such a special innovative company. We are also excited that Jeff will retain a very important role at the company that he founded and has guided for over 25 years. He has created a culture of invention and innovation that drives us every day, and we remain bound by our common focus and obsession on the customer. With that, let’s move on to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.  Thank you. Our first question is coming from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig a bit deeper into the incredible acceleration that we saw in the international business, obviously, pandemic aside, wondering if you could help us sort of break down the pieces of what drove that into specific regions, specific initiatives that drove that level of acceleration? And then just on the AWS business, bit more of a housekeeping question, would you mind going through just where the backlog stands and any material drivers of changes in the that to the extent there has been any?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure. Thank you, Heath. I would start on international segment results. So yes, it was sequential growth jump from 33% in Q3 to 50% in Q4. Part of that is the timing of Prime Day, but in the U.S. it was less pronounced, sequential growth was 39% to 40% in the North America segment. So, there was something else going on in international in Q4. I would attribute it really to the government actions and lockdowns that we saw, especially in the UK and Europe. I think that increased during the quarter unfortunately for the economy, but it did drive higher sales on our site. We also saw probably a larger impact of moving Prime Day from Q3 to Q4 in international just because it’s a little more nascent there, it’s still ramping up but very strong performance.
Dave Fildes: Yes, Heath, this is Dave. On the backlog number, it’s at about $50 billion at the end of the year, the balance and that’s up about 68% year-over-year. So that’s one component of all the great work that AWS is doing, and of course you are seeing some continued very strong growth, strong usage and revenue growth there, $51 billion annualized run-rate business. So, it’s continuing to grow at a meaningfully larger absolute dollar rate than others out there, and we are really pleased with the growth we are seeing in there. It’s as Brian touched on at the opening, just a lot of good engagement and innovation coming out of the re:Invent conference as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Just following up on some of the comments you made between the release and in your opening comments, Brian, wanted to know if we could tease out how we should be thinking about the level of investments that are needed between the mix of fulfillment versus where you want to go on the customer service side and the logistics and delivery side as you look up to ‘21. And obviously, it’s going to be a very different year in ‘21 than what we saw in ‘20, where you saw a surge in demand and a lot of capacity constraints that have opened up as the year goes on. And there will be sort of tougher comp dynamics as you get into the middle of ‘21 as you are lapping against that demand impact in ‘21? How do we think about the levels of investment you will make, where those investments are going to go, and what that means for sort of confidence on the demand side over the medium to long-term? Thanks so much.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Eric. Obviously, we had a large investment last year, crew fulfillment capacity, including transportation 50% year-over-year. I would say that – and it’s been, I believe it’s $44 billion on CapEx, yes. We are still working through our plans for 2021. I think the added complexity here is the range of outcomes certainly was the case in 2020, but even for 2021, there is a lot of question as to the continuation of COVID conditions comping against prior year sales, sometimes there are things in there that definitely wouldn’t repeat probably the number of gloves we sold and hand lights  and things like that or computer monitors that people setup their home offices. But there is also a lot of people who engage more strongly with Prime benefits in 2020, and we think that will have a lasting impact both from purchase frequency, amount they purchased, use of digital benefits, etcetera. So, we are going to have to build probably for multiple scenarios, and in this FC  world, it’s hard to turn that capacity on quickly. So, it generally means you may have to overbuild to protect the customer experience. On transportation, we made large investments in our transportation network in 2020. That work is not done yet. We have a lot of continued expansion. So, we see that over definitely through 2021. I can’t quantify it right now only – I am only giving guidance through Q1 right now, and we are still working some -- through some of the plans as we do this time of the year. And then infrastructure will remain a healthy part of our investment as well. We are supporting an AWS business that is growing at a rapid clip both in usage and in revenue. We are expanding regions globally and have a lot of upside in that area talking with customers on their transition plans to the cloud. So, we definitely do not want to run out of capacity, and we work to not do that. So, there could be a risk of forward spend in 2021 due to the uncertainty, but we will see as we move through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.
Doug Anmuth: Sorry, I was muted. Brian, hoping you could talk more about the importance of AMZL Amazon Logistics during the holiday season. If you could talk more about percentage of packages perhaps shipped from your fulfillment centers and then where this can go in coming years? And then also a quick comment on the COVID costs, you mentioned $2 billion in 1Q, just curious how you think about it more on a full year basis with some of the puts and takes can be there? Thanks.
Brian Olsavsky: Yes. So yes, for the full year, we are again $11.5 billion was our gross cost for 2020, $4 billion of that in Q4. We see a step down to closer to $2 billion in Q1 that compares with a $600 million spend last Q1 as the pandemic just started and we started to react in March. And obviously, this cost escalated in Q2 and Q3. So, if we look at the core components of that, right, there is productivity that – productivity drags from hiring so many new employees and also having physical separation. That gets better all the time. It was exasperated a bit in Q4, because of all the new hires that we brought on over 170,000 new people that should moderate. That’s why one of the reasons that we see a step down in Q1 versus Q4, it’s volume-related and also mix of employees. After that, we are going to have to see again hopefully the vaccine gets going, everyone gets vaccinated and we return to normalcy. That would be very helpful on a lot fronts for everybody. And if not there will be continuation of some of these costs. I will say that, while we are very transparent or try to be on the costs that we are seeing, specifically around COVID, there are some positive things happening as that counteract a bit of that and not the least of which is the top line volume in 2020, we grew 37% on an FX neutral basis versus growing 22% in 2019. And the fact that we have been running pretty full out since arguably April, but definitely it’s May, has created operating efficiencies of its own that counterbalance the physical separation and the training of new employees. So there is a lot of moving parts in here. We are able to save about $1 billion in transportation costs this year – excuse me in 2020 as for universally, all travel was shutdown and our sales teams found new ways to reach customers. We will see how that develops over time. Marketing, although it got back to probably more healthy levels in Q3 and Q4 definitely was lower in Q2 as we work through some capacity issues and it wasn’t fruitful to invest in marketing when you are having trouble hitting existing customer demand. So, there are a lot of moving parts that I will try and be as transparent on as I can be during the quarter and this again Q1 is we are seeing about $2 billion of absolute COVID costs. And Dave can take the AMZL question.
Dave Fildes: Yes. Just as we talk about AMZL, Amazon Logistics, right, that’s where you think about that in terms of facilities, it’s a lot of the middle mile and the last mile elements that are under our management and control. And so you are talking about centers at the middle mile delivery station to the last mile. We have talked on a square footage basis 2020 was a big build year for us. Our footprint grew around 50%, about half of that incremental square footage fit into that sort of AMZL transportation side of the equation, which is a higher mix than what you have seen of any incremental adds in a year. It’s higher mix being 50:50 than what you see from us in the past. So, a lot of focus on that there both because of the desire to pre-pandemic increase the one day delivery capabilities for Prime members. That also as we have moved through this year, it gives us a little bit more or much more certainty on being able to get items from point A to point B. So we finished here where now more than half our packages, both U.S. and worldwide are handled through AMZL and a lot of work going into that. And so, we will look to expand and continue to build on that with our AMZL offerings. But as we have said in the past, our delivery partners, independent delivery partners that are out there, the USPS is certainly oversees carriers as well, are an important part of that and they will continue to help us scale that up and build up that offering and make it better.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
John Blackledge: Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, the other revenue line saw significant acceleration in 4Q, just curious if you can talk about or provide some further color on the advertiser demand that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then secondly on grocery was a big driver for Amazon in 2020 just general thoughts on grocery and I think you mentioned in the release, 7 communities rolled out Amazon Fresh grocery stores, how are they performing and should we expect a broader rollout?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, John. Let me start with the other revenue question. Yes, we saw strength in other revenue grew 64% in Q4 versus 49% in Q3 and 41% in Q2 that is primarily advertising. That’s the majority of it. I would say that there has been a recovery, in advertising spend as the year progressed. The fact that we moved Prime Day into Q4 has an impact here, because again it carries a lot of clicks and eyeballs into Q4 for this time period. But I want to highlight a lot of great work being done by the advertising team. Their main principle is to help sellers, vendors, authors, publishers and partners use our tools, navigate them as fluidly as possible, and add value both for them and for our customers – and customers and get to see and find and discover new and different products. There is some things that are adding to the efficiency of advertising. We are now using a deep learning model to show more relevant sponsored products and had success with that. We are improving the relevancy of ads shown on the product detail pages all the time. And we have seen rapid adoption of video creative format for sponsored brands. All these things help checkup the conversion and the productivity of the advertising both for the seller or vendor involved and also for Amazon and makes it more productive experience with the customer as well.
Dave Fildes: John, on the grocery point, yes, we have got a couple of different formats, I think there is the Go Grocery has a couple of locations open and off to a good start, lot of interest in those and the technology that those offer as well as the Amazon Fresh locations. So we are at about 8 locations open and I think in the neighborhood of about half dozen locations are confirmed at open, so more to come on those. There is other kind of tangents of footprints on that, the Go stores, there is around 25 of those that are out there and that also important part of that is food. So, you see us it’s we have talked about this a bit in the past is we are doing that with online grocery and branching out from Whole Foods and some of the other physical footprint locations and being able to offer that convenience, but we also think that being able to offer some innovative physical store grocery offerings like these Go and Fresh, some of which have some pretty cool self-checkout capabilities and implement some of the Just Walk Out technology qualities are really some interesting areas that are resonating with customers. I think they appreciate that not just in times of maybe not wanting to have physical contact with everyone in the store, but just even beyond that, the general convenience of being able to move throughout the store and check out more efficiently than you otherwise would in a traditional retail environment, so excited to do more on that front.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, I would be curious to hear about any of the learnings you had from the strength of the international business in 2020 and how you think about the right types of investments to make in that business in ‘21 and beyond to ensure you retain as many of these users and wallets as you’ve gained throughout 2020? And the second one understanding the comments, Brian, earlier about sort of investments going forward, maybe just talk to us a little bit about one-day. Are these investments you are making, could they get you back to a one-day product in later part this year or in ‘22 when the world normalizes or are these assets you are putting in place now not able to be deployed from a one day perspective when overall e-commerce slows down a little bit?
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Brian. Let me start with your international question. I think the biggest learning is that if we can move 2021 volume into 2020, it creates good leverage for us and it’s kind of what we saw. There was essentially a doubling of the growth rate versus probably the going in time – rate for 2020. Now again, that was a very hard volume because of the COVID restrictions and issues with our workforce, keeping our workforce safe and everything else, but I think what you saw was some very high leverage on that model that overcame some of the more fixed costs that we’re seeing in the Prime benefits. So we pre-invested, as we have discussed in the past, in things like video and devices and other elements of the Prime offering, now grocery, you’re starting to see. And we have added those Prime benefits ahead of probably the curve that you would have seen in North America. So that has always created a bit of a drag on operating income, that as well as investments in new geographies, the investment in India, the investment that we’ve made over the last two or three years that are in places like the Middle East, Turkey, Brazil, Australia, most recently, Sweden and the Netherlands in 2020. So there’s a lot of moving parts in the international segment. But you’re starting to see the benefit of the higher volumes and with it, higher advertising as well that we expected and we expect over-time. And we’ll see the growth rate is going to have the same challenges year-over-year that perhaps we’ll see in North America we’re going to have a race between lapping things that may have been one-time in nature in 2020 versus accelerating Prime membership and Prime members’ purchases, purchase frequency and adoption of digital benefits. So we will see what that looks like in 2021, very happy with the performance in 2020 and really hats off to the teams in many countries around the world who are all dealing with the same issues that we were in North America.
Dave Fildes: And I know this is a bit of an offshoot, but I just think it’s worth mentioning it fits in the AWS business, but we’re continuing to see strong growth from AWS around the world as well. And there is a number of international located customers out there like MercadoLibre and Zalando and others that we’ve listed in there that are great customers for us. So we’re working on that and really looking to support that just globally. And I mentioned this before, but re:Invent, it was a great way to bring a lot of those folks from around the world together virtually and free. And typically, we’ve recorded the revenue for re:Invent from ticket sales and sponsorships. If you account for this COVID anomaly this year of it being virtual and free, AWS year-over-year revenue growth, if you look at it, actually accelerated adjusting for that from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So a lot of fun innovation, good innovation coming out of that event that we’re excited to talk more with customers about.
Brian Olsavsky: And then your question on one-day, I believe it was whether our investments will be consistent with establishing higher and higher levels of one-day. Yes, definitely. And we’ve been doing that throughout the year and it’s been getting better. In fact, we had a lot of examples of deliveries right up to the last minute on December 24 in the United States for holiday gifts. So the one-day has been getting better, and it’s – the issues in 2020 was essentially around capacity and volume and getting things at the door and being able to then hit a shortened time period. So it wasn’t that we were delaying or slowing down the shipment itself, it was the time taken to get through the warehouse and handle backlog of demand. So as the year progressed, we did see that get better and better. We do forecast that it will get better. I’m not quantifying this for you. I realize that. But I think you can generally notice wherever you’re particularly are, whatever geography you are, some cities are back probably to one-day levels that they saw or even better pre-pandemic. Other areas that may have other dynamic issues are still working their way out of backlogs and volume issues. But when the dust settles and as we open up more and more capacity, you’ll see greater and greater one-day percentages for our Prime shipments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post: Alright, thank you. A couple. First, obviously, the Jeff Bezos announcement is quite important. I think Jeff Wilke is also retiring. Can you talk a little bit if you expect any changes to Amazon, how we should think about that? And then maybe Dave Clark is taking over retail. Talk a little bit about that. And then secondly, obviously, the backlog is really strong in AWS, up 68%. The margins did come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter to 28%. Can you talk about the deals, how pricing is in the cloud segment? Is it remaining robust and any reason the margins came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter? Thank you.
Brian Olsavsky: Sure, Justin. Let me start with your comments on the CEO transition and then the Consumer CEO transition. I think they’re both examples of what are highly effective succession planning processes at Amazon. The Board of Directors obviously takes that very seriously. It is an annual discussion and probably more often on succession plans, development of key executives, expanding the number of key executives, etcetera. And you see the byproduct of that as we expand the S team as we, 5 years ago, set up the two-CEO structure where Jeff Wilke was CEO of Consumer and Andy Jassy was CEO of AWS. We have strong single-thread leaders on devices, Amazon or – Video, including Amazon Studios, Advertising. So I think there’s a lot of bench strength within Amazon and generally, we do try and push the decisions down in the organization as we scale, especially internationally as we try and do things consistently globally, but recognize local differences in our model. So having said all that, succession planning is super important. The example you saw with Jeff Wilke, Jeff announced in the fall that he was stepping down to pursue some other goals and interest that he has outside of Amazon. He had been here over 20 years, had been super pivotal in our development of our consumer business, our culture, the development of layers and layers of leaders. And one of them was Dave Clark, who has, over the last 5 plus years, really been charged with developing some very fundamental things for our Company, the expansion of the fulfillment center network, the expansion and creation of our transportation capacity, grocery delivery and the grocery plan, a lot of other things. But Dave had been great leader in his own right. So when Dave – or, excuse me, when Jeff Wilke decided to retire in the fall, it was a natural transition to Dave Clark. And that just occurred in January, and they’re wrapping things up in the next month. So that’s a successful example of succession planning and a successful transition. Same thing for Jeff Bezos’ role and I will reiterate that Jeff is not leaving. He is getting a new job. He’s going to be Executive Chair of the Board, super important role. The Board is super active and important in Amazon’s success story. And Andy has been here since 1997. He is not only a visionary leader. He is a strong operator as I said and he has got a great track record of developing multiple things and businesses within Amazon, not the least of which is AWS, which is arguably the most profitable, important technology company in the world. So that’s just a flavor on the insight on how it works. We’re very happy to see both Jeff and Andy get new perspectives. So Andy has a chance to put his imprint on Amazon. He is certainly going to carry through the culture and the vision and the invention factory that Amazon is and will take that to the next level. Jeff will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. He will be involved in many large one-way-door issues, as we say, one-way doors, meaning the more important decisions, things like acquisitions, things like strategies and going into grocery and other things. So Jeff’s always been involved with that, and that’s where we will keep his time focused on – or he will keep his time focused on in his new role, so very excited all around to see the ability to have a strong transition to Andy in Q3. We will be working on backfilling the AWS role and we will talk more about that in the future, but for now, today is about Andy and Jeff Bezos.
Dave Fildes: And Justin, just on your AWS point, I mean, like I’ve mentioned before, AWS growth rate is strong. The factors we’ve talked about in the past continue to be in play. We’re improving infrastructure planning to meet the capacity needs, given the growth we’re seeing. More broadly, our results reflect that balance between the investing, the price reductions, driving cost efficiencies and the margins are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors to the extent we are investing in new regions and some other elements. A few discrete things that aren’t probably new but just to call out, the driver of the reduced impact from the change in the useful life of the servers. As you recall, we amended the server useful life at the beginning of the year from 3 to 4 years, and so we saw some benefit to the AWS margins and the broader margins in total. When we look at that, the impact does diminish throughout this year. So when we increased it beginning in January, the benefit from this change in Q4 was about $538 million. That’s down from $634 million in Q3. So that gives you some sense of it’s coming down. That’s the total amount that’s allocated amongst the segments, but the majority of those figures I just gave do relate to AWS because significance of the server assets going to that segment. And again, that impact’s going to continue to taper down over time for example into Q1 of 2021. One other element is just FX impact. That’s always going to hit us to some degree, but AWS customer billings are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. The cost, though, if you think about it, many of the costs are going to be for build-out in local currency for data centers and the people that work there and power and what have you, so there’s a bit of a foreign exchange difference there. And that happens to be this time around a little bit bigger. We saw an unfavorable impact of about $96 million to the AWS margin this time around for FX, so just another point to call out there. You mentioned the backlog, too. Look, I think that’s one data point amongst many as you look at AWS, but I think we’re really encouraged by just general large enterprise business adoption is continuing to do well as they are choosing AWS as a tech provider and speeding up innovations. You saw a long list of the many companies that we have announced arrangements within the past 90 days, so really excited to continue to build onto that.
Operator: Our final question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Sandler: Hey, guys. Yes, just going back to the topic of shipping cost inflation. This is one of the few lines that’s kind of variable and kind of increasing a little bit faster than the other fixed costs. And Dave, you mentioned that over half the orders are now going through Amazon Logistics worldwide. When do you expect that rate of inflation per order to level out a little bit because of these efforts? And if you look at the cost curve in places like the UK where – or in London, where you have well over half on your own last-mile delivery, are you starting to see leverage there? Any comments on that? And thanks a lot.
Dave Fildes: Yes. On that – this is Dave. I think it’s not – I won’t give a forward kind of guidance mix or what that levels-off like. Some of the step-up in costs and disparity or the bigger gap, I should say, versus the unit growth rates that you’re seeing there, there’s a few factors. But I think this is Q4. We did add on a lot of new capacity as I said. It came on later in the year into Q4. More of it was in kind of that transportation arm and so the costs associated with that would be going to that trans cost piece. So that’s one of the factors, along with the fact that we’re continuing to try where we can to focus on improving one-day. And that varies region to region with all the kind of challenges of COVID that have gone on this year. But that’s a goal of ours, is to get back to where we were in terms of one-day unit mix and continue to build onto that. So that’ll be something to keep an eye on as we move into 2021.
Dave Fildes: Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.";[-0.07047025525869377, -0.010583988140551503];-0.010583988140551503;-0.07047025525869377;0
